l6a0q7	liberal	Republicans now 'shocked, shocked' that there's a deficit, HAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHA the Republican Party folks	"© Greg Nash Republicans now 'shocked, shocked' that there's a deficit

Republicans are channeling their inner Louis Renault, the corrupt police chief in ""Casablanca"" who, needing a pretense to close Rick's Cafe, said he was ""shocked, shocked"" there was gambling going on, as the waiter slips him his winnings.

Since President Biden and the Democrats took control, more Republicans are ""shocked, shocked"" at big budget deficits. ""We have an ever-growing deficit, an ever-growing debt and no apparent interest in taking the steps that are necessary to address it,"" worries South Dakota's John Thune, the third ranking Senate Republican. Wisconsin's Sen. Ron Johnson is ""shocked"" that since he arrived in Washington in 2011 the national debt has almost doubled and ""few in Congress seem to care.""

As Joe Biden would say, give me a break.

These were the same Republicans who accommodated Donald Trump most every step of the way as the federal deficit and national debt nearly doubled - before COVID-19. Sen. Johnson, a Trump loyalist, is right that the national debt has almost doubled in his ten years - but he fails to mention most of that occurred in the last four - with his enthusiastic support. For his part, Sen. Thune supported Trump more than 91 percent of the time.

The Trump champions like Peter Thiel, the oddball maverick Silicon Valley billionaire, criticized the media four years ago for taking the candidate ""literally"" rather than seriously (The line originated with a conservative columnist.)

That was dead wrong.

Trump should have been taken literally. He telegraphed most everything: his racial bigotry, contempt for experts whether they be scientists or generals, the ""America first"" neo-isolationism, the fondness for dictators including Russia's Putin. On the economy and budget, Trump declared he would massively cut taxes, boost defense spending and not touch entitlements like Social Security and Medicare.

This is what he did.

Senate Republicans voted unanimously for the tax cut as did 95 percent of House Republicans, a price tag of more than $2 trillion over ten years. They supported a 20 percent increase in defense spending and abandoned their long held demands about reining in entitlements.

Mick Mulvaney, the former Tea Party congressman and Trump chief of staff, acknowledged the hypocrisy on debt: Republicans thought deficits were ""the worst things in the world"" when Barack Obama was president and were ""a lot less interested"" when Trump took over.

Now is the worst time to rekindle that interest, real or political.

This is one of those times the federal government has to go big. There is so much hurt: more than 10 million are jobless; more than 12 million can't meet rent and utility payments; up to 30 million are food deprived; many small businesses are closing, with dim prospects for reopening, and state and local governments are being forced to cut back on programs aiding already suffering constituents.

There is no prospect for any real improvement until the raging virus is under control. That requires a major infusion of assistance to accelerate production and distribution of the vaccine and for the strained health care system. Biden proposes to spend more than $400 billion in COVID relief.

The Biden proposal, not perfect, is well considered and vitally necessary to expedite a recovery.

The opposition is part ideological, a lot political.

The right-wing refrain is 'It's a big-spending socialist scheme.' But the President's initiative has been embraced by the Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable and the leading Trump administration economist, Kevin Hassett. None are listed in the Democratic Socialists of America green book.

Moreover, there is a minimal risk of adding lots more red ink to save the economy. In a paper for the Brookings Institution, the two most prominent Democratic economists - former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and Jason Furman, who headed the Council of Economic Advisers - persuasively reiterate that with the ""epochal decline in real interest rates"" in recent years, big budget deficits are far more acceptable: ""In a world of unused capacity and very low interest rates and costs of capital,"" they write, ""the old fears of deficits crowding out private investments"" are not warranted.

It's always challenging for the federal government to spend a huge amount of money in a short time. For that task, Biden has assembled an experienced and talented team, starting with Jeff Zients, who fixed the botched rollout of Obamacare, in charge of the COVID-19 response.

The $1.9 trillion was padded in the final drafting so it could be shaved; one way is to target the $1,400 checks so it's going to those most in need and not to the relatively well-heeled.

If the contingent of Senate Republicans who say they are serious about a compromise really are, they should get some concessions, some tweaks, cut 20 percent to 25 percent from the cost, and vote for this emergency measure in the next two weeks.

kuscob	liberal	Report: QAnon Congresswoman Was Live-Tweeting Nancy Pelosi’s Location To Terrorists	"Domestic Terrorist: Rep. Lauren Boebert, a newly elected member of congress and a big QAnon supporter, is facing calls for her arrest after live-tweeting Nancy Pelosi’s location to terrorists as they stormed the U.S. Capitol earlier this week.

Raw Story reports:

Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO), a gun-toting supporter of the QAnon movement, is facing backlash after she was accused of live-tweeting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) location during the attack on Capitol Hill last week.

As Trump supporters were storming the Capitol, Boebert warned the terrorists that Pelosi had been moved, tweeting:

The Speaker has been removed from the chambers. — Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) January 6, 2021

The Speaker has been removed from the chambers.

Before tweeting that Pelosi had moved, she had tweeted:

We were locked in the House Chambers.

In addition, Boebert tweeted encouragement to the domestic terrorists before the assault, declaring:

Today is 1776. — Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) January 6, 2021

Today is 1776

As one might imagine, many are calling for Boebert’s arrest and removal from congress. The following is a sample of reactions to Boebert’s deplorable behavior:

Any member who actively helped the terrorist mob sack the Capitol should be expelled by a 2/3 vote. This includes @laurenboebert �� https://t.co/fjNkQjN08h — Laurence Tribe (@tribelaw) January 10, 2021

j2lufw	liberal	More than 175 current, former law enforcement officials endorse Joe Biden, slam Trump as 'lawless' president	"EXCLUSIVE: More than 175 current and former law enforcement officers and officials endorsed Joe Biden for president on Friday, while slamming President Trump as a ""lawless"" president, Fox News has learned.

Fox News first obtained the list of the Biden-supporting law enforcement officials, which includes former U.S. attorneys, former state attorneys general, former sheriffs, and former police chiefs who touted the former vice president’s experience “keeping communities safe.” It includes Janet Napolitano, the former Obama administration secretary of Homeland Security who served as attorney general of Arizona.

BIDEN SPEAKS WITH JACOB BLAKE, HITS TRUMP’S ‘LAW AND ORDER’ PUSH DURING WISCONSIN VISIT

“Joe Biden has always stood on the right side of the law and is offering a much needed vision for our Nation. When asked the question, would you feel safe in Joe Biden’s America? The answer is yes,” said Tom Manger, the retired chief and former president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association. “I’ve worked with Vice President Biden for years and know that he can heal the divide in our Country. He has condemned violence of all kinds, and there is no question that I would feel safe in Joe Biden’s America.”

Meanwhile, the retired chief of the Madison, Wis. Police Department, Noble Wray, slammed Trump as a “lawless” president.

“It’s ironic that a lawless president claims to be the ‘law and order’ president,” Wray said. “We are at a crossroads with this nation, and we need a president that has always prioritized the safety of Americans and their families.”

Wray added: “We have seen time and time again that Donald Trump has prioritized advancing his own political interests before considering the well-being and livelihood of Americans.”

And retired Illinois police Col. Joann Johnson echoed a similar sentiment, slamming the president for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

“COVID has devastated our economy, killed thousands of Americans. The murder rate is up, and more cops have died of COVID-19 this year than on patrol,” Johnson said. “Yet, despite all that, Donald Trump has continued to insist he is the law and order president without condemning violence, providing a plan to control COVID-19, or a path for economic recovery.”

Johnson added: “Joe Biden has done all those things but, most importantly Joe is a man of character and of family values who I believe can heal our nation and begin to restore the trust between law enforcement and communities of color.”

The endorsements come after a number of high-profile police and law enforcement organizations have already thrown their support behind Trump.

In July, the National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO) endorsed Trump, praising his “steadfast and very public support” for law enforcement.

NAPO did not endorse a candidate in the 2016 election but endorsed former President Barack Obama and then-Vice President Joe Biden in both the 2008 and 2012 elections.

And last month, a New York City law enforcement union, the Police Benevolent Association (PBA), endorsed the president's re-election.

The endorsements from the prominent police organizations for the president come amid criticism against Biden over his calls for police reform and potential cuts for local law enforcement, and with some Republicans claiming the former vice president supports the “defund the police movement.”

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

The criticism came after Biden, during an interview with NowThis conducted by progressive activist Ady Barkan, said that some funding should “absolutely” be redirected from police.

“But do we agree that we can redirect some of the [police] funding?” Barkan asked Biden.

“Yes, absolutely,” said the former vice president.

Biden's campaign has repeatedly said, however, that he does not support defunding the police.

This week, though, Biden clarified his position on the matter himself, voicing his support for law enforcement.

""Let's get the facts straight, I not only don't want to defund the police. I want to add $300 million to their local budgets to deal with community policing to get police and communities back together again,"" Biden told KDKA.

Meanwhile, the endorsements come amid unrest in cities across the country, including in Kenosha, Wis., after 29-year-old Jacob Blake, a Black man, was shot at close range in the back by a city police officer, leaving him partially paralyzed.

Biden visited Kenosha on Thursday, and spoke with Blake and his family.

Trump visited Kenosha on Tuesday, and toured damaged businesses and met with law enforcement officers. He did not meet with Blake’s family."	left
l8m3a8	liberal	GOP group launches billboards demanding Cruz and Hawley resign	"GOP campaigners have called on senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley to resign through billboards that condemn them for supporting claims the 2020 election was “stolen”.

The billboard campaign, which launched on Thursday, targets 10 other Republicans who also rejected Joe Biden’s presidential election win when Congress voted on 6 January – hours after they came under attack by Donald Trump’s supporters with claims the election was “rigged”.

About $1 million (£729,000) has been spent on the billboard campaign, Politico reported, which has been set-up by the Republican Accountability Project (RAP), a group of former GOP officials who formed together in the days after the Capitol riot.

RAP has already committed to spend $50 million (£36 million) supporting GOP members of Congress who voted to impeach Mr Trump on 13 January, as well as senators who vote to convict him for “incitement of insurrection”.

That vote will follow a second impeachment trial in the Senate, which is set to begin on 8 February despite recent calls by Mr Cruz to “move on”.

One billboard by RAP says that Mr Cruz ""lied about the election. The Capitol was attacked. Sen. Cruz: Resign.” It is due to appear in his Texas constituency, with billboards also planned in major US cities.

Other Republicans targeted by the campaign include the House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, who met with Mr Trump in recent days, as well as a number of House Republicans who voted against the election results and Mr Trump’s impeachment.

Sarah Longwell, executive director of the Republican Accountability Project, told Politico that those targeted by the billboards are “people who are the most enthusiastic about lying to their constituencies about the election being stolen”.

“The goal is to not allow these officials to memory-hole the fact that they pushed this lie, which incited the attack on the Capitol,” said Ms Longwell.

“It took a lot of players within the Republican party to convince the vast majority of their voters that the election was fraudulent,” she added.

House members Devin Nunes, Matt Gaetz, and Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has come under scrutiny for supporting QAnon and other conspiracies in recent days, are also on the RAP billboards."	left
irazuh	liberal	Democrats and Republicans Aren’t The Same And Your Vote Fucking Matters.	"VOTE! Anyone saying otherwise is at best misinformed and at worst malicious.

I am long past the point of simple pleasantries. For years I have allowed in my presence idiots who claim they are politically and socially informed spew lies about our political system. I too often took the approach that “they believe what they want to believe, and I will never change it.” But that considerate act has made me complicit in one of the most horrific deceits in our history. And I am fucking done.

Democrats and Republicans aren’t the same. They never were.

Former-New York Governor Mario Cuomo laid out the two American parties’ core differences best in his 1984 Democratic Convention speech, A Tale of Two Cities:

The difference between Democrats and Republicans has always been measured in courage and confidence. The Republicans—The Republicans believe that the wagon train will not make it to the frontier unless some of the old, some of the young, some of the weak are left behind by the side of the trail. “The strong—The strong,” they tell us, “will inherit the land.” We, Democrats, believe in something else. We Democrats believe that we can make it all the way with the whole family intact, and we have more than once. Ever since Franklin Roosevelt lifted himself from his wheelchair to lift this nation from its knees—wagon train after wagon train—to new frontiers of education, housing, peace; the whole family aboard, constantly reaching out to extend and enlarge that family; lifting them up into the wagon on the way; blacks and Hispanics, and people of every ethnic group, and native Americans—all those struggling to build their families and claim some small share of America. For nearly 50 years, we carried them all to new levels of comfort, and security, and dignity, even affluence. And remember this, some of us in this room today are here only because this nation had that kind of confidence. And it would be wrong to forget that. So, here we are at this convention to remind ourselves where we come from and to claim the future for ourselves and for our children. Today our great Democratic Party, which has saved this nation from depression, from fascism, from racism, from corruption, is called upon to do it again—this time to save the nation from confusion and division, from the threat of eventual fiscal disaster, and most of all from the fear of a nuclear holocaust.

In 2020 the differences between Democrats and Republicans have never been more apparent, and saying they are the same is just plain stupid.

The Democrats believe in expanding healthcare, including securing universal health care through a public option, investing more in medical research to come up with a cure for Alzheimer’s, cancer, and AIDS, a women’s right to choose, gender equality, same-sex marriage, and allowing same-sex couples to adopt legally. They believe in trans rights (including serving in the Military), and the right not to be discriminated against and fired from your job because of your gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, or religious beliefs. The Democrats believe in immigration (including Muslims) and providing a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented, including DACA recipients. They believe in science and what they see with their own eyes: that climate change is real and wearing a mask can save lives.

The Democrats believe in guaranteeing universal early childhood education, investing more in K-12 schools, making higher education affordable, paying teachers more, including investing in more Black and Brown teachers, providing borrowers relief from student debt, and providing our children with the technology and wifi that so many cannot afford. They also believe in providing free breakfast and lunch and housing for the millions of children living in poverty. The Democrats have always believed in affordable housing.

The Democrats want to overturn the Citizen United decision, which eased restrictions on corporate and union campaign spending. Speaking of unions, the Democrats are pro-union. THAT IS NOT A BAD THING! They want to raise the minimum wage nationally, promote worker’s rights, and enact robust work-family policies. Yes, paid maternity and paternity leave. Yes, pay for those who have to take time off from work to take care of an aging parent or grandparent. They want to level the economic playing field by reforming the tax code to benefit working families, curbing wall street abuses, protecting consumer rights and privacy, and tackling runaway corporate concentration.

The Democrats want to protect America’s Civil Rights including achieving racial justice and quality, women’s rights, LGBTQ+ rights, disability rights, honoring indigenous Tribal Nations, ending violence against women, and the epidemic of gun violence. They want to pass, protect and enforce voting rights, reform the broken campaign finance system, strengthen the U.S. Postal Service, making Washington D.C. the 51st State, and guarantee self-determination for Puerto Rico.

And unlike the Republicans, The Democrats can say Black Lives Matter. And they have no problem admitting that we need police reform in this country, and we must invest more in our communities, especially our schools, including after-school programs, our healthcare, and our parks. They also have no problem speaking the truth that COVID-19 impacted Black and Brown communities at disproportionate rates and we must address it.

The Republicans do not support the above, and if they do, we do not know that they do, because this year, they did not release their party platform. All we hear is what we hear from the leader of their party, the pussy-grabbing, cognitive-testing, dictator-loving, calling the end of slavery “always questionable” President who calls our military members “losers” and “suckers” (they are not) and insists Black and Brown people are causing chaos in our cities and suburbs (they are not) and has called the first Black president and who may be the first Black vice president “insults to our country” (they re not).

Your vote always matters.

Yes, even if you live in a strictly blue or red state. Those who say otherwise are at best misinformed and at worst malicious. Democratic Vice Presidential candidate Kamala Harris said it best when she recently questioned, “Why don’t they want us to vote? Why are they creating obstacles to us voting?”

If our vote doesn’t matter, why are people spending tens of millions of dollars (often our tax-dollars) in our federal court systems to make it harder for us to vote? Why is one party trying their damnest to prevent Black, Brown, and young people from voting? Why is it that it has to be NBA players who must strike to make it easier for Black Americans to vote in this country?

The Washington Post has an interactive you can play around with that shows if Joe Biden wins over just once percent of White swing voters, he would flip four states and capture 307 electoral votes. If Black turnout raches the same rate (8% higher than 2016) as it did in 2012, Joe Biden would flip three states and would win the presidency.

Okay, but what if I live in New York or California? Hate to break it to you, you lazy fucks, your vote still matters. Let’s go back in time a bit to early 2017. During the first months of Donald Trump’s presidency, the thing that riled him the most was that he lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes. It also prevented him from claiming the mandate that usually comes from when someone wins by a lot.

But let’s face it, voting isn’t just about the President. Depending on your district, you can also be voting for your Sheriff, your judge, your kids’ school superintendent, your district attorney, and your city council member who can help you secure permits, fill in potholes, and help your small business receive economic relief during a pandemic.

Your vote matters. It always had mattered. That is why so many people before us fought for the right to vote, and so many today are fighting for the right to vote. And it is why so many don’t want you to vote.

So, please, please, please vote. Don’t listen to idiots.

l6yelz	liberal	Joe Biden’s Done More Good in a Week Than Donald Trump Did in Four Years	"After just over a week we can safely say that Joe Biden is the greatest president in American history.

I say that only because the last president, who shall remain nameless, repeatedly told us that he was the greatest president in American history. And Joe Biden is clearly better than he was. In fact, looking at the 30 executive orders produced by Biden, his vaccine plan, his restoration of normalcy to foreign policy, the efficiency and effectiveness of his administration to date, the diversity of his team, the transparency he has restored to the White House, the importance of some programs to which he has committed—from raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour to protecting our natural resources from commercial exploitation and systematically working to root out racially-driven inequity from our system—an objective observer would have to say that the Biden-Harris administration has done more good for the country in a week than the previous one had done in four years.

OK, I admit it. That’s easy to say since most of what the prior administration did was, in fact, bad for the country. Simply undoing their legacy will save lives, reduce economic inequality, revitalize the economy, protect the environment, and restore American leadership.

None of this was preordained. The Biden team inherited what is likely to be viewed as the greatest public health crisis in U.S. history (we will probably pass the death toll for 1918 flu epidemic sometime this spring), the biggest economic downturn since the Great Depression, a political crisis that included a coup attempt against the U.S. government, a crisis linked to America’s institutional racism, and the profound and deepening climate crisis. The outgoing administration also actively worked to impede the transition—more so than any of its predecessors in our history.

Nevertheless, the new president and his team continued to build on the discipline and effectiveness of their well-run political campaign. Despite provocations and attacks, they never took the bait from their conspiracy-theory and big-lie promoting opponents. They remained focused on the work at hand and confident in America’s political institutions.

In fact, Biden’s calm certainty that American democracy would survive the demented and corrupt onslaught of attacks from the leaders of the opposition and from the threatening network of right-wing extremists and white supremacist groups deserves more note than it has gotten. Biden was the steady hand, not just a politician but a man who understood both public service and the foundational concepts on which our system depends.

The result was not only unmistakably restorative; it was a commitment to the basics of doing the work, a return to once quotidian, recently neglected, notions of good governance. Nor was it simply a rhetorical shift or one that occurred simply within the confines of the White House.

As reported in a recent story by David Sanger in The New York Times, within days the Biden team had filled over 1,000 top jobs in the administration—a full quarter of all those open to them to fill. They also began to remove appointees put in place by the previous administration, some who had been put in jobs they hoped would preclude their removal, to serve as “moles” or as a kind of wannabe “deep state” for their patrons.

To those who understand how Washington works, it is a stunning start under the worst of circumstances. Much credit must go not only to the president and vice president but to the extremely capable team they have put in place led throughout this period by long-time Biden adviser and now White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain. Management is often the most undervalued skill set among our political elites. Not this time.

Indeed, those management abilities honed through decades of experience may give this administration an edge over the administration in which so many of its members developed much of that experience, that of Barack Obama. Obama is widely regarded to have gotten off to a good start. But several differences between the two administrations are clear, however.

These begin with Biden, who has dramatically more experience that Obama did when he came to the presidency. Biden, in fact, has more government experience than any prior president, including almost three times as many years of foreign policy experience as did George H.W. Bush, considered until now to be a standout in that regard.

Biden’s Cabinet is, as noted, more diverse, the first in history to achieve gender parity. It is a group that has been better vetted than Obama’s team was and thus appears likely to have fewer misfires in the appointment and confirmation process. They know one another and have worked together. Klain has more experience in the chief of staff role than any of his predecessors (except James Baker who served in the job twice).

On foreign policy, for example, Obama’s relationship with his incoming secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, was that of political rivals. He did not know National Security Adviser Jim Jones well, and that cost Jones, who was often second-guessed by Obama loyalists, a factor that led to his relatively brief tenure in the job. Obama’s first secretary of defense was a hold-over from the Bush years, Bob Gates, and not someone close to the president.

“ As a former senior member of the Obama administration said to me, “[Biden] didn’t pick many assholes. The asshole quotient is very low in this group. They will get along and they won’t try to blow each other up.” ”

This led to the “team of rivals” description of the group. But it also produced less cohesion with a president who was himself very much a foreign and national security policy neophyte. That will not happen here. This team has worked together for a long time, and they are all well known to Biden who knows his brief well on these issues.

I should add that the Biden team stands out among the pool of potential Democratic nominees to these jobs not only by virtue of their experience and because they are regarded to be among the smartest members of the Democratic policy community. Also, as a former senior member of the Obama administration said to me, “[Biden] didn’t pick many assholes. The asshole quotient is very low in this group. They will get along and they won’t try to blow each other up.”

In a not entirely unrelated observation, Biden moved away from certain key groups that dominated thinking during the Obama years, notably on economic policy. Obama’s group, understandably, given the financial crisis he inherited, was very Wall Street oriented, mostly disciples of Clinton Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin. The group led by incoming Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is less in the thrall of the capital markets and big money and, by inclination, more progressive. Yellen’s stance during her hearings, saying that she supported major relief for the market now and that we could handle the debt implications, was a strong signal in this regard.

It is of course early days to make sweeping judgments. And there are worrying signs on the horizon. There are a lot of strong personalities in the administration, and it remains to be seen whether they will be able to maintain process discipline. More worrying is the fact that Biden’s calls for unity and his aspiration to bipartisan support have not produced any notable course-changes from the GOP (although, to be fair, thus far, Biden’s key Cabinet nominations have had solid bipartisan support).

Mitch McConnell dragged his feet on power-sharing with new Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Most in the congressional GOP have proven unwilling to even join in condemnation of the insurrection that led to five deaths and hundreds of injuries in the building in which they themselves work. Partisan divisions seem as bad as ever.

That said, we have been through hell for four years. We reached a nadir when it comes to presidential leadership, good governance, the level of corruption, and even of the loyalty of the president and his supporters to our Constitution or our country. So, if there is good news, if there are signs of progress, let’s not blame ourselves too much for savoring them and seeing them as hopeful signs about this country’s future."	left
jsdt01	liberal	The Republican Party Needs To Be Razed and the Earth Salted Behind It	"Let our journalists help you make sense of the noise: Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter and get a recap of news that matters.

Why do I think the Republican Party is beyond redemption? I view their policy positions as mostly appalling, but that’s not the reason. I’m going to disagree with pretty much any conservative party, after all. It’s more about the underlying nature of the party leadership and what it believes it has to do in order to win. Over just the past decade or so, the Republican Party:

Chose Donald Trump as its presidential nominee.

Has openly strategized about suppressing the Black vote because Black voters heavily favor Democrats.

Played footsie with insane conspiracy theories like QAnon.

Spent the entire Obama presidency ginning up fake scandals.

Lied relentlessly about its dedication to reducing the deficit.

Lied equally relentlessly about its dedication to passing a health care bill.

Lied (and lied and lied) about the impact of its tax bills on the rich.

Has killed untold thousands of people by making mask-wearing into a partisan football during a pandemic.

Has openly appealed to racial bigotry as a way of increasing its share of the white vote.

Denied the obvious reality of destructive climate change solely for partisan benefit.

Is currently doing its best to convince its base that the entire 2020 election was fraudulent.

This is, needless to say, not an exhaustive list, and none of it has anything to do with conservative policy. It speaks solely to the moral judgments of the party’s leaders, and these moral judgements are now so ingrained that I see no hope they’ll ever be abandoned. Perhaps in a different media universe they would have already paid a price for this, but in a conservative media universe dominated by Fox News, talk radio, and the Wall Street Journal editorial page they can get away with almost anything. Most Republican voters probably don’t even know their party has sunk to this level.

The key question is whether it’s possible to convince moderate conservatives to care about this kind of stuff. Or, like so many of us, are they willing to give it a pass as long as Republicans do the things they want them to do? It’s a discouraging thought."	left

Akerman noted that a New York Times report referenced “avoidance” in the headline.

""It looks like Trump has done a whole series of activities that could qualify as tax fraud, not tax avoidance. This is a very important distinction,” he told CNN’s Erin Burnett.

""Tax avoidance is simply taking the tax code and getting the most deductions you can get under the code that is perfectly legal. Tax fraud, however, is lying about what your income was, lying about what your deductions are, and there's a couple of items that just stand out in that report from the New York Times that really appear to go beyond tax avoidance.”

Akerman pointed to the Times’s reporting that Trump’s eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump Ivanka TrumpJill Biden a key figure in push to pitch White House plans CNN: Trump advisers urge him to make pro-vaccine PSA Fox News's Bret Baier posts vaccination selfie MORE, was paid $747,622 in consulting fees.

“There is no legitimate reason for her to get those consulting fees since she was being paid already as a Trump employee,” he said.

Ex-Watergate prosecutor Nick Akerman says the NYT’s report on Trump’s taxes shows that both he and his daughter, Ivanka could face legal liabilities. “The only thing saving him at this point is the Department of Justice’s guideline that says you can’t indict a sitting president.” pic.twitter.com/4YI1qDhI5g — OutFrontCNN (@OutFrontCNN) September 28, 2020

""The only possible reason for doing this was to somehow move money around so that it wouldn't be taxed to Donald Trump but would in effect go on Ivanka Trump's tax return, who probably had certain losses that she could take against it,” he added.

“So in the end, the government gets zero dollars.""

Trump has attacked the Times’s reporting and defended his financial practices but did not dispute any specific parts of the reporting.

Republicans have long known that America’s rising generations were going to be a problem for their party. The only questions have been “How big?” and “How soon?”

The bulk of Americans born between 1981 and 1996 saw Bill Clinton preside over an age of (relative) peace and prosperity — and then George W. Bush steer their nation into failed wars and economic collapse. Zoomers, meanwhile, are coming of age amid, well, [gestures broadly at a landscape littered with foreclosed houses, police executions, pandemic breadlines, and melting ice sheets, all watched over by a billionaire Fox News addict who’s focused on his tweets].

Political science research suggests that a voter’s partisan preferences tend to be deeply informed by their evaluations of presidential performance in adolescence and early adulthood. Americans who came of age during the Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon presidencies leaned Democratic for years after. Those who attained a sense of self amid Jimmy Carter’s losing battle against stagflation — and/or Ronald Reagan’s boom times — remained disproportionately Republican as they aged.

Thus, millennials and Zoomers were already likely to lean left, even if their generations hadn’t been more diverse, highly educated, and atheistic than their predecessors. But they are. And since all of those traits correlate with ideological liberalism, it’s none too surprising that the kids are all left (or, almost all left, anyway).

A new poll from Axios and SurveyMonkey-Tableau reveals that — despite our nation’s deeply ingrained regional political divisions — young Americans are rejecting conservatism from sea-to-shining sea, with only a few stray patches of red in between. In a survey of 640,328 likely voters across the country, Axios found voters under 35 backing Biden in 40 of 50 states. Young voters broke for Trump in five, and split their votes about evenly in the remaining states.

Graphic: Axios

In an ominous sign for the GOP’s future viability in the Electoral College, young voters in light-red Sun Belt states are very Democratic, with those in Texas and Georgia backing Biden over Trump by roughly 20 points. In South Carolina, meanwhile, young voters lean blue by 13. Across this year’s most hotly contested battlegrounds — Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — Biden’s lead among young voters never dips below 18 percentage points.

Thanks to his strength among seniors, Biden is less dependent on high youth turnout than Hillary Clinton was in 2016. But if younger voters do turnout at a historically high rate, they could deliver Democrats a landslide large enough to flip state legislatures across the country, and deliver Chuck Schumer a Senate majority with a couple votes to spare.

There are a few reasons to believe that “America’s future” will make its presence felt this November. For one thing, the millennial generation is starting to enter its prime voting years. Under normal circumstances, we might be one presidential cycle away from the cohort becoming a reliable turnout bloc. But as the Democratic pollster William Jordan wrote in 2017, there was reason to suspect Donald Trump might accelerate millennials’ political maturation:

[A] voter stops being under-represented in the electorate at about age 40 — which is the age of some of the oldest Millennials in around 2022 … It’s not obvious that the Millennial Reckoning will come in 2018, or even 2020. That said, based on data from past elections, it’s when a cohort starts to nudge up against their fourth or fifth presidential election cycle that they start seeing real improvements in turnout rates — and that’s about where Millennials are now. Looking just at how Boomers and Gen-Xers behaved around a similar time, we’d expect Millennial turnout to increase by around 5 or 6 points between 2016 and 2020.

We haven’t yet seen what it looks like when Millennials come into their own as a voting bloc, and it will almost certainly happen. The only question is, will it happen gradually, or suddenly? Is there anything going on in American politics that might spur an unusual lurch forward among the nation’s youngest, most diverse and most educated generation?

The 2018 midterm results offered evidence for the “lurch” thesis. Millennial turnout in that election jumped 20 points from where it had been in 2014 (the previous midterm). What’s more, in the first midterm that any Zoomers were old enough to vote in, 30 percent of those eligible cast a ballot. That is a notable improvement on the 23 percent rate that Gen X and millennials posted in their respective first midterms.

As of this writing, a record-shattering 45 million Americans have already cast ballots in the 2020 election. This is, of course, partly a reflection of pandemic-induced shift in voting methods, as more Americans avail themselves of mail ballots. But combined with polling data on intention to vote, the early returns suggest that the 2020 election could inspire the highest U.S. voter turnout in more than a century. It is possible that this surge is being driven by infrequent older voters making a point to cast a ballot this year, rather than by a surge in millennial and Zoomer participation. But all else equal, high overall turnout is a positive indicator for unusually high young voter turnout.

On the other hand, the pandemic has dealt a major blow to the Democratic Party’s voter-registration efforts. Recent data from the key swing states of Florida, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania show Republicans are adding voters to the rolls far faster than Democrats. According to Democratic operatives I’ve spoken to, this is partly because their party is more reliant on registering voters when they interface with the state — say, during a trip to the DMV — or else, on college campuses, or in high-school seniors’ classrooms. The drop-off in public congregation at schools and government facilities has thus prevented Democrats from fully capitalizing on generational churn: There are a lot of young, left-leaning adults in the U.S. who would have registered to vote in a year without a pandemic, but will not do so in 2020.

Regardless, the future is coming, if not this November, then one in the near future. (Which is a large part of why the conservative movement has been transitioning from covert attacks on democracy to open advocacy for minority rule.)"	left
jpzysd	liberal	Goodbye, Bill Barr	"In just two years, Attorney General William Barr transformed the Department of Justice into a sleazy, third-rate law firm devoted to shielding Donald Trump and his friends from the consequences of their crimes. A coterie of attorneys with prestigious law degrees and sterling résumés joined Barr’s crusade to place Trump above the law. The attorney general’s tenure played out as a natural experiment: What happens when the embodiment of the right-wing Federalist Society becomes the nation’s chief law enforcement officer? The answer has been a ghastly disaster for the rule of law.

Now that Trump has lost reelection, Barr will soon step down. His departure will not undo the immense damage that he inflicted upon the Justice Department, which is supposed to enforce federal law fairly, impartially, and independently from the president’s whims. He has turned the principle of prosecutorial independence into a farce. It will take years to persuade Americans that the attorney general is anything more than a glorified bag man for the president.

There was never any reason to believe that Barr had a shred of honor. During his last stint as attorney general under George H.W. Bush, he persuaded the president to pardon key players in the Iran-Contra scandal. After a few decades in private practice, Barr then reemerged toward the start of Trump’s presidency, auditioning for his old job. Barr supported Trump’s baseless calls for a criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton over the Uranium One deal. (If you don’t remember the Uranium One controversy, that’s because it was a nonsense conspiracy theory.) He also defended Trump’s decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, criticized special counsel Robert Mueller, and circulated a memo arguing that Mueller could not charge Trump with obstruction of justice. This audition worked: Trump tapped Barr for the job in December 2018, securing his confirmation the following February.

Advertisement

Barr immediately assumed the position of Trump’s personal attorney. He released a misleading summary of the Mueller report before its publication that framed the president in the best possible light. Then, just before releasing a heavily redacted version of the report, Barr held an appalling press conference that tried to spin the report in Trump’s favor and justify the president’s blatant efforts to obstruct the investigation. His lies were so egregious that a federal judge later slammed the attorney general’s “misleading” and “calculated” distortions, concluding that Barr could not be trusted.

Advertisement

Even that wasn’t enough for Trump, who reportedly commanded Barr to undermine Mueller’s probe by concocting evidence that … well, in truth, the plan here was never totally clear, which is probably why it failed. It seems Trump wanted his attorney general to prove that the Obama administration—from the president down to the “deep state”—had sought to subvert his 2016 campaign. Barr told Congress that “spying did occur,” then embarked upon a European tour to dredge up proof that the FBI (?) and America’s international allies (??) engaged in a global conspiracy (???) to fabricate Russian interference in the 2016 election. This effort collapsed completely because it was based on the blatherings of fringe, far-right Twitter personalities who had Trump’s ear. Barr never came up with a shred of evidence to back up Trump’s semicoherent ramblings.

Advertisement

But the attorney general came through for Trump on other fronts. He interfered in the prosecution of Roger Stone, the Trump ally who was convicted of seven felonies, including witness tampering, obstruction of justice, and lying to Congress. Barr forced prosecutors to request a lower sentence, though his meddling was rendered irrelevant when Trump commuted Stone’s sentence. The attorney general also compelled the DOJ to drop the prosecution of Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, after Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Trump had publicly demanded that Barr let Flynn off the hook.

Advertisement

Against the backdrop of this corruption, Barr anointed himself the spiritual leader of the Federalist Society, a powerful group of conservative attorneys backed by a lavishly funded dark money network. In a speech to the Federalist Society that drew continual applause, Barr accused Democrats of seeking to destroy America. He claimed that progressives are on a “holy mission” to “use the coercive power of the State to remake man and society in their own image,” using “any means necessary to gain a momentary advantage in achieving their end.” Trump’s political opponents were borderline terrorists engaged in a “war to cripple” the president. Barr insisted that the executive is effectively a monarch who endures unfair “harassment” and “encroachment” from the other branches. In terms only slightly more academic than Trump’s, Barr told a room of Federalist Society that the president—this president, Donald J. Trump—should be allowed to do whatever he wants to destroy his political enemies, avoid prosecution, and own the libs. His audience responded with a rapturous standing ovation.

It’s important to recognize that Barr did not emerge from nowhere. He is a Federalist Society stalwart, coming up in the conservative legal circles that produced so many of Trump’s lackeys—including his judges. Barr’s most disgusting actions were supported by rank-and-file Federalist Society lawyers installed at the Justice Department to transform Trump’s lies into legal briefs. Need lawyers to lie to the Supreme Court about the real purpose of a citizenship question on the census? The DOJ has you covered. How about the real reason for repealing DACA? No problem. Excluding undocumented immigrants from the reapportion of House seats? Done. None of the DOJ attorneys who lied under oath to shore up some abhorrent Trump policy will face any consequences, either. They have already begun shuffling back to the white-shoe law firms whence they came, where they will crush unions, obliterate the rights of consumers, and defend polluters—until the next Republican presidency, when they’ll get another plum job in the federal government.

Barr found himself in the spotlight whenever he ran interference for Trump. He tried to shield the president from a grand jury subpoena of his tax returns, a congressional subpoena of his financial records, and a defamation lawsuit from one of his alleged rape victims. But what Barr did while few were watching was equally repulsive. His Justice Department argued against the rights of LGBTQ Americans. It fought abortion access tooth and nail. It stood up for the ability of corporations to poison the country with toxic waste and pollution. It combatted states’ efforts to treat immigrants like human beings. It tried to undo one of Trump’s few genuine accomplishments, the First Step Act, by refusing to release elderly, ailing, and rehabilitated federal prisoners. Most importantly, Barr’s DOJ asked the federal judiciary to eradicate the Affordable Care Act—an act that would strip health insurance from 23 million Americans and legalize discrimination against patients with preexisting conditions in the midst of a pandemic.

Advertisement

Despite all this, Barr’s most nauseating moment may have come during the racial justice protests that erupted across the country this summer. The attorney general infamously abetted the gassing of protesters for a presidential photo-op. He flooded D.C. with unmarked federal agents who refused to state which law enforcement agency (if any) they work for. These officers looked, to all the world, like a paramilitary squad. Barr sent federal officers into other cities, where they threw protesters into unmarked vans without any apparent legal justification. He created his own personal battalion by drawing officers from different federal agencies and deploying them to crush demonstrations. He also aggressively charged protesters, urging prosecutors to bring sedition charges and consider prosecuting elected officials.

When Trump nominated Barr, a number of establishment Republicans who loathe the president supported Barr’s confirmation under the theory that he might moderate Trump’s worst instincts. It’s easy to understand why. Barr himself was an establishment Republican for decades, entrenched in the clubby milieu of corporate lawyers, GOP politicians, and academic trolls at the heart of the conservative legal movement. Trump did not convert Barr to Trumpism. He simply gave Barr permission to drop the mask. How many other well-respected conservative attorneys would throw their integrity out the window to further the white nationalist agenda of a criminal con man? A whole lot, as we’ve discovered over the past four years. Barr will be gone by January. But the army of Federalist Society lawyers who elevated him to power isn’t going anywhere.

jsiyg0	liberal	Donations under $8K to Trump ‘election defense’ instead go to president, RNC	"(Reuters) - As President Donald Trump seeks to discredit last week’s election with baseless claims of voter fraud, his team has bombarded his supporters with requests for money to help pay for legal challenges to the results: “The Left will try to STEAL this election!” reads one text.

But any small-dollar donations from Trump’s grassroots donors won’t be going to legal expenses at all, according to a Reuters review of the legal language in the solicitations.

A donor would have to give more than $8,000 before any money goes to the “recount account” established to finance election challenges, including recounts and lawsuits over alleged improprieties, the fundraising disclosures show.

The emailed solicitations send supporters to an “Official Election Defense Fund” website that asks them to sign up for recurring donations to “protect the results and keep fighting even after Election Day.”

The fine print makes clear most of the money will go to other priorities.

A large portion of the money goes to “Save America,” a Trump leadership PAC, or political action committee, set up on Monday, and the Republican National Committee (RNC). Under Federal Election Commission rules, both groups have broad leeway in how they can use the funds.

The Trump campaign, the RNC and Trump’s new Save America PAC did not respond to requests for comment.

Leadership PACs such as Save America are often set up by prominent political figures to spend money on other candidates, while also paying for personal expenses, such as travel and hotel stays.

The disclosures would allow Trump and the RNC to channel the donations into other political causes or campaigns, such as the two high-stakes January Senate runoff races in Georgia that could determine control of the Senate and are likely to rank among the most expensive races in U.S. history.

Trump’s solicitation website carries a banner headline that says “OFFICIAL ELECTION DEFENSE FUND” and “CONTRIBUTE NOW.”

Scrolling down the page would take a donor to the fine print, which shows that donations are split between “Save America,” which gets 60% of the money, and the RNC, which gets the other 40%. None of the money flows to Trump’s official “recount” committee fund until Trump’s Save America share reaches the legal contribution limit of $5,000, according to the disclosures.

That means that, before a dollar goes into the recount fund, Save America would receive $5,000 and the RNC around $3,300. Donations to the recount committee are legally limited to $2,800.

If a Trump donor gave $500, for instance, $300 would go to Trump’s Save America PAC, $200 would to the RNC - and nothing would go to his election defense fund.

One Republican political strategist said Trump is misleading supporters who might give small donations to whatever cause he approves.

“It’s important to be up front with people - especially those who are digging deep into their pockets to come up with $25,” said Michael DuHaime, a former political director at the RNC. “If you tell them it’s going for legal fees, well then it should go for legal fees.”

Darrell Scott, an Ohio pastor who helped found the National Diversity Coalition for Trump and served on the president’s 2016 transition team, says he sees no problems with diverting the money to the leadership PAC or the RNC.

“I see this as two pockets on the same pair of pants. It doesn’t matter if it goes into the left or the right pocket,” Scott said. “In the end, the money will be used for a legitimate purpose that his supporters will get behind.”

FLURRY OF LAWSUITS

The fundraising pitches have channeled Trump’s rage and his refusal to accept the results of an election that major media outlets called on Saturday for his Democratic opponent Joe Biden, the former Vice President. Most of the Republican Party has fallen in line with Trump’s rhetoric, either by staying silent or publicly supporting the election challenges.

Trump’s campaign has filed a flurry of lawsuits to overturn the results in key states without producing evidence to back his charges of illegal voting. Trump’s lawsuits have instead generally alleged violations of process, such as a lack of access for Republican observers. Legal experts said none of the cases were broad enough to invalidate the number of votes required to overturn Biden’s presumed victory.

Judges have quickly dismissed many of the lawsuits. State election officials, including Republicans, have said there was no widespread fraud. Just a handful of Republican senators have recognized Biden’s win. Many more have not but some Republicans have suggested their patience with Trump’s legal fight may run out soon.

As the president fights what Democrats have called his inevitable ouster from the White House, his fundraising campaign seeks to replenish campaign coffers that were depleted during the presidential race, according to Federal Election Commission data.

Trump’s re-election team kicked off 2020 with an impressive cash advantage, thanks to a massive fundraising operation, including joint efforts with the Republican Party. But the advantage evaporated as Trump’s campaign burned through $1.4 billion of the $1.6 billion raised over the past two years.

By mid-October, the Trump campaign and the Republican Party reelection team were left with $223.5 million and had to scale back advertising. The Trump campaign itself only had $43 million entering the final three weeks of the presidential election, while Biden and the Democrats had $432 million in cash for the final stretch, including $177.3 million in Biden’s campaign.

‘LAVISH LIFESTYLES’

Trump’s post-election fundraising emails - sometimes issued hourly over the last several days - used names such as the Election Defense Task Force and the Official Election Defense Fund. Initially, the disclosures said that Trump would steer a large part of the contributions to pay down campaign debt.

But the disclosure language changed after Trump’s campaign treasurer, Bradley Crate, incorporated the Save America political action committee on Monday. Crate did not reply to requests for comment.

Unlike campaign funds, which have tight controls on how they can be spent, leadership PACs such as Save America carry few restrictions. Republicans and Democrats alike have drawn criticism for using them to pay family members and to fund luxury events in exotic locations. A 2018 report by the Campaign Legal Center and Issue One, two groups that advocate campaign finance reform, said some leadership PACs have been used as vehicles to “subsidize lavish lifestyles” of politicians “on their donors’ dimes.”

Larry Noble, former general counsel at the Federal Election Commission, said Trump could use the committee to finance a post-election political career. He said the pitch is misleading for donors who don’t read the fine print.

“He’s really making a big deal about the challenge to the election, and that may very well be why a lot of people may give without paying attention to, or understanding, what the political language is,” Noble said. “It’s pretty dangerous to our democracy to use attacking our elections as a fundraising tool.”

The North Carolina Republican Party has launched a similar strategy, using the election challenges as a way to raise money for other purposes. In several mass emails to potential donors this week, the party says - alongside images of Trump - that it is seeking money to help protect the integrity of the elections.

The legal disclosures, however, show the money is going to an account to pay for the party’s overhead costs and not directly to any challenges of this presidential election. Trump is expected to win North Carolina’s 15 electoral votes.

“They should be more transparent,” said one prominent North Carolina Republican, speaking on condition of anonymity. “If they are soliciting money to help with a legal challenge, and instead the money is going to pay the salary of the political director, that doesn’t seem right.”

Tim Wigginton, a spokesman for the North Carolina Republican Party, said in a statement that the party wants to “ensure every legal ballot is counted” but did not address questions about whether the fundraising appeals are misleading or why the donations are not being directed to legal defense."	left
ita496	liberal	Scientific American Endorses Joe Biden; We’ve never backed a presidential candidate in our 175-year history—until now	"Scientific American has never endorsed a presidential candidate in its 175-year history. This year we are compelled to do so. We do not do this lightly.

The evidence and the science show that Donald Trump has badly damaged the U.S. and its people—because he rejects evidence and science. The most devastating example is his dishonest and inept response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which cost more than 190,000 Americans their lives by the middle of September. He has also attacked environmental protections, medical care, and the researchers and public science agencies that help this country prepare for its greatest challenges. That is why we urge you to vote for Joe Biden, who is offering fact-based plans to protect our health, our economy and the environment. These and other proposals he has put forth can set the country back on course for a safer, more prosperous and more equitable future.

The pandemic would strain any nation and system, but Trump's rejection of evidence and public health measures have been catastrophic in the U.S. He was warned many times in January and February about the onrushing disease, yet he did not develop a national strategy to provide protective equipment, coronavirus testing or clear health guidelines. Testing people for the virus, and tracing those they may have infected, is how countries in Europe and Asia have gained control over their outbreaks, saved lives, and successfully reopened businesses and schools. But in the U.S., Trump claimed, falsely, that “anybody that wants a test can get a test.” That was untrue in March and remained untrue through the summer. Trump opposed $25 billion for increased testing and tracing that was in a pandemic relief bill as late as July. These lapses accelerated the spread of disease through the country—particularly in highly vulnerable communities that include people of color, where deaths climbed disproportionately to those in the rest of the population.

It wasn't just a testing problem: if almost everyone in the U.S. wore masks in public, it could save about 66,000 lives by the beginning of December, according to projections from the University of Washington School of Medicine. Such a strategy would hurt no one. It would close no business. It would cost next to nothing. But Trump and his vice president flouted local mask rules, making it a point not to wear masks themselves in public appearances. Trump has openly supported people who ignored governors in Michigan and California and elsewhere as they tried to impose social distancing and restrict public activities to control the virus. He encouraged governors in Florida, Arizona and Texas who resisted these public health measures, saying in April—again, falsely—that “the worst days of the pandemic are behind us” and ignoring infectious disease experts who warned at the time of a dangerous rebound if safety measures were loosened.

And of course, the rebound came, with cases across the nation rising by 46 percent and deaths increasing by 21 percent in June. The states that followed Trump's misguidance posted new daily highs and higher percentages of positive tests than those that did not. By early July several hospitals in Texas were full of COVID-19 patients. States had to close up again, at tremendous economic cost. About 31 percent of workers were laid off a second time, following the giant wave of unemployment—more than 30 million people and countless shuttered businesses—that had already decimated the country. At every stage, Trump has rejected the unmistakable lesson that controlling the disease, not downplaying it, is the path to economic reopening and recovery.

Trump repeatedly lied to the public about the deadly threat of the disease, saying it was not a serious concern and “this is like a flu​” when he knew it was more lethal and highly transmissible, according to his taped statements to journalist Bob Woodward. His lies encouraged people to engage in risky behavior, spreading the virus further, and have driven wedges between Americans who take the threat seriously and those who believe Trump's falsehoods. The White House even produced a memo attacking the expertise of the nation's leading infectious disease physician, Anthony Fauci, in a despicable attempt to sow further distrust.

Trump's reaction to America's worst public health crisis in a century has been to say “I don't take responsibility at all.” Instead he blamed other countries and his White House predecessor, who left office three years before the pandemic began.

But Trump's refusal to look at the evidence and act accordingly extends beyond the virus. He has repeatedly tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act while offering no alternative; comprehensive medical insurance is essential to reduce illness. Trump has proposed billion-dollar cuts to the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, agencies that increase our scientific knowledge and strengthen us for future challenges. Congress has countermanded his reductions. Yet he keeps trying, slashing programs that would ready us for future pandemics and withdrawing from the World Health Organization. These and other actions increase the risk that new diseases will surprise and devastate us again.

Trump also keeps pushing to eliminate health rules from the Environmental Protection Agency, putting people at more risk for heart and lung disease caused by pollution. He has replaced scientists on agency advisory boards with industry representatives. In his ongoing denial of reality, Trump has hobbled U.S. preparations for climate change, falsely claiming that it does not exist and pulling out of international agreements to mitigate it. The changing climate is already causing a rise in heat-related deaths and an increase in severe storms, wildfires and extreme flooding.

Joe Biden, in contrast, comes prepared with plans to control COVID-19, improve health care, reduce carbon emissions and restore the role of legitimate science in policy making. He solicits expertise and has turned that knowledge into solid policy proposals.

On COVID-19, he states correctly that “it is wrong to talk about ‘choosing' between our public health and our economy.... If we don't beat the virus, we will never get back to full economic strength.” Biden plans to ramp up a national testing board, a body that would have the authority to command both public and private resources to supply more tests and get them to all communities. He also wants to establish a Public Health Job Corps of 100,000 people, many of whom have been laid off during the pandemic crisis, to serve as contact tracers and in other health jobs. He will direct the Occupational Health and Safety Administration to enforce workplace safety standards to avoid the kind of deadly outbreaks that have occurred at meat-processing plants and nursing homes. While Trump threatened to withhold money from school districts that did not reopen, regardless of the danger from the virus, Biden wants to spend $34 billion to help schools conduct safe in-person instruction as well as remote learning.

Biden is getting advice on these public health issues from a group that includes David Kessler, epidemiologist, pediatrician and former U.S. Food and Drug Administration chief; Rebecca Katz, immunologist and global health security specialist at Georgetown University; and Ezekiel Emanuel, bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania. It does not include physicians who believe in aliens and debunked virus therapies, one of whom Trump has called “very respected” and “spectacular.”

Biden has a family and caregiving initiative, recognizing this as key to a sustained public health and economic recovery. His plans include increased salaries for child care workers and construction of new facilities for children because the inability to afford quality care keeps workers out of the economy and places enormous strains on families.

On the environment and climate change, Biden wants to spend $2 trillion on an emissions-free power sector by 2035, build energy-efficient structures and vehicles, push solar and wind power, establish research agencies to develop safe nuclear power and carbon capture technologies, and more. The investment will produce two million jobs for U.S. workers, his campaign claims, and the climate plan will be partly paid by eliminating Trump's corporate tax cuts. Historically disadvantaged communities in the U.S. will receive 40 percent of these energy and infrastructure benefits.

It is not certain how many of these and his other ambitions Biden will be able to accomplish; much depends on laws to be written and passed by Congress. But he is acutely aware that we must heed the abundant research showing ways to recover from our present crises and successfully cope with future challenges.

Although Trump and his allies have tried to create obstacles that prevent people from casting ballots safely in November, either by mail or in person, it is crucial that we surmount them and vote. It's time to move Trump out and elect Biden, who has a record of following the data and being guided by science.

ii9zxr	liberal	Arizona Is on the Verge of Turning Fully Blue; The Republicans could lose not only its presidential electors, but its U.S. Senate seat and state legislature.	"The Republicans could lose not only their presidential electors, but its U.S. Senate seat and state legislature.

Arizona is not only the birthplace of Goldwater libertarianism, it’s a giant retirement home for relatively well-to-do white transplants. The large Latinx population has created a dynamic where, to assure a monopoly on power, whites have tended to vote as a group. It seldom elects Democrats to statewide office and has only voted for a Democrat for president once since 1948. Yet, it’s still trending blue.

As Igor Derysh explains at Salon, the Democrats have been dreaming about carrying Arizona in a presidential race since 2004, but so far it has been reminiscent of Charlie Brown’s efforts to kick a football. This could be the year that the Dems carry Arizona and its many down-ballot offices.

FiveThirtyEight’s average of polls currently has Joe Biden ahead by 3.7 percentage points. It’s not a big lead, but it has been persistent. The polls of the U.S. Senate race between incumbent Republican Martha McSally and Democratic challenger Mark Kelly give the challenger a substantial lead. The most recently released survey, conducted by Redfield & Wilton Strategies, has him up by 19 points.

Besides federal races, Republicans risk losing both chambers of their state legislature.

Democrats are “very confident” of their chances to flip the state legislature, Felecia Rotellini, the chairwoman of the Arizona Democratic Party, told Salon. “Both chambers are on the precipice of turning blue for the first time in 50 years,” she said. “We need three seats in the Senate and two in the House to gain control. We are fighting for each and every seat and the path to achieving these majorities is clear.”

Republican Governor Doug Ducey’s term doesn’t end until 2022 and he’ll be ineligible to reelection so he’s insulated from the public’s wrath over his handling of the COVID-19 crisis. In July, a survey from OH Predictive Insights showed Ducey with a 35 percent approval rating, down 22 points from June when coronavirus cases in Arizona began to spike.

Trump will likely run stronger than McSally, owing to more firm support from the Republican base, but that’s not particularly good news for the other Republicans. The party’s brand is severely tarnished and it’s more likely to drag Trump down than he is to lift them up. I can’t say that this makes a tremendous amount of intuitive sense, but that’s what the numbers are telling us.

Arizona Republicans should be concerned about life after Trump whether he’s defeated in less than 70 days or not. Without his galvanizing effect on the conservative electorate, they may discover that Arizona isn’t just purple but fully blue. After November, Democrats may hold two U.S. Senate seats and the state legislature. They may snap up the governorship in 2022. Arizona could be the next Virginia, and that would be a remarkable shift for the land of Goldwater."	left
kziiva	liberal	Biden to kill Keystone XL pipeline extension on inauguration day	"TORONTO -- A source close to the transition team of U.S. president-elect Joe Biden has told CTV News that the new president will kill the Keystone XL pipeline after taking office.

According to the transition briefing documents, reviewed by CTV News' Washington Bureau Correspondent Richard Madan, the plan to use an executive order is listed under Wednesday, Jan.20, his first day of office.

The Keystone XL pipeline extension is a controversial cross-border project that seeks to build upon existing infrastructure transporting Canadian crude oil into the U.S. It aims to deliver 830,000 barrels of oil from Hardisty, Alta. to Steele City, Neb., and would cost approximately US$8 billion.

Biden's election campaign has been open about his intention to dissolve the TC Energy's Keystone deal since May, when he was running to be the Democratic candidate.

TC Energy has not commented directly on Biden's reported decision, but issued a statement Sunday evening announcing that they would be aiming to make Keystone XL the first pipeline to be powered fully by renewable energy, saying the initiative would ensure ""it will have the lowest environmental impact of an oil pipeline in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.""

The move is part of his promise to roll back actions U.S. President Donald Trump made while in office that stripped environmental protections. Biden has also promised that the U.S. will be rejoining the Paris Accord, which Trump withdrew the country from in 2017.

A Canadian source close to the matter told Madan that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau brought up the subject in a congratulatory phone call with Biden following his victory in the U.S. election.

They spoke for around 10 minutes, the source said, and agreed to continue discussions later down the road.

In an emailed statement Sunday, Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador to the U.S., told CTV News that the Canadian government still stands by the project, and that ""Keystone XL fits within Canada's climate plan.""

""The government has announced a strengthened climate plan with $15 billion in investments to build a cleaner, more resilient economy, and exceed our current 2030 GHG reduction target,"" she wrote. ""We are also legislating Canada's goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.

""Underpinned by a crucial and longstanding trade and security partnership, there is no better partner for the U.S. on climate action than Canada as we work together for green transition.""

The statement did not comment on Biden's promise to end the deal.

The Keystone XL pipeline extension has sparked protests from climate and Indigenous groups on both sides of the border. Activists have expressed fears of leaks injuring wildlife and potentially poisoning water sources.

In 2019, the existing Keystone pipeline suffered a leak in eastern North Dakota, spilling 1.4 million litres of oil and impacting more than 19,000 square metres of land.

Critics of the project have also pointed out that sinking more time and money into oil in a time when the world is looking to move away from it makes little economic sense, particularly in the face of plummeting oil prices.

""This is what true climate leadership looks like,"" Annamie Paul, leader of the federal Green Party, said in response to news of Biden's expected cancellation of the Keystone deal.

She added in a tweet that the Trudeau government had announced three environmental assessment decisions for three offshore drilling projects this week, implying it showed a ""contrast in leadership.""

South of the border, former Democratic presidential nominee Bernie Sanders called the pipeline project a ""disaster,"" tweeting that he was ""delighted"" by the decision.

""With all of the major crises facing America, we must never lose sight of the most existential threat facing our planet: climate change.""

The Keystone project was vetoed by former U.S. President Barack Obama in 2015, citing environmental concerns -- but shortly after taking office in 2017, Trump reversed course and signed an executive order to allow the pipeline.

Construction began on the project in Alberta this summer, and was set to be completed by 2023. The project promised 2,000 construction jobs to Albertans.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has been a vocal supporter of the project, recently hiring Capitol Hill lobbyists in Washington, D.C. to shore up support for Keystone XL.

Kenney said in an emailed statement Sunday that he was ""deeply concerned by reports"" that Biden will cancel the deal.

""As the Government of Canada has said, building Keystone XL is 'top of the agenda' with the incoming Biden administration,"" Kenney wrote. ""Prime Minister Trudeau raised the issue with President-elect Biden on their November 9, 2020 telephone meeting, agreeing to engage on key issues, including ... [sic] energy cooperation such as Keystone XL.

""We renew our call on the incoming administration to show respect for Canada as the United States' most important trading partner and strategic ally by keeping that commitment to engage, and to allow Canada to make the case for strengthening cooperation on energy, the environment, and the economy through this project.""

He added that he believes it would be a blow to the economy on both sides of the border due to the job loss and that Canada shares the U.S.'s commitment to ""environmental stewardship [and] combatting climate change.""

I am deeply concerned by reports that the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden may repeal the Presidential permit for the Keystone XL border crossing next week.



My full statement: pic.twitter.com/vZjun1IdMH — Jason Kenney (@jkenney) January 18, 2021

Conservative leader Erin O'Toole also registered his disappointment, claiming that the cancellation of the Keystone deal will ""devastate thousands of Canadian families who have already been badly hurt by the economic crisis.

He also called on the federal government to reach out to Biden to ""stop this from happening.""

Cancelling Keystone XL will devastate thousands of Canadian families. We need to stand up for working Canadians. My full statement: pic.twitter.com/beo03qvQKA — Erin O'Toole (@erinotoole) January 18, 2021

Rachel Notley, leader of Alberta's NDP, said in a tweet Sunday that the Keystone project had been ""a risk,"" and criticized Kenney for the ""massive gamble"" that is now unlikely to come to fruition, despite Kenney's call to the federal government to intervene.

Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe also called upon Trudeau to ""leverage his relationship with Mr. Biden"" to change the pipeline decision, adding that ""Saskatchewan will continue exercising our contacts in Washington D.C. to advocate for the continuation of this project that clearly benefits both of our nations.""

It’s very disappointing to hear reports that President-elect Biden is planning to shut down the Keystone Pipeline expansion on his first day in office. 1/4https://t.co/Suonhiit1e — Scott Moe (@PremierScottMoe) January 18, 2021

Duanne Bratt, a political science professor from Mount Royal University, believes it's too late for Biden's mind to be changed, particularly since cancelling the Keystone pipeline was a campaign promise and strongly supported by the Democratic party.

""I'm not sure what lobbyists are going to do between now and Wednesday afternoon,"" he told CTV News Channel.

One of the ""big losers in this announcement"" is the government of Alberta itself, he said.

""Almost a year ago, Jason Kenney invested about $1.5 billion in purchasing part of the Keystone pipeline, and also provided a whole set of loan guarantees for TC Energy. It looks like that investment is now going to be lost on the first day of Biden's administration.

""The decision to hire lobbyists may have been just another mistake to go with the partial purchase of the pipeline by the Kenney government.""

He said he was surprised by the announcement because Canada's climate plan is more robust now than it was in 2015 when Obama rejected the Keystone deal.

The decision is a clear win for environmentalists, but it won't be without repercussions, Bratt added.

""I think this is going to hurt Canada-U.S. relations,"" he said. ""If in fact Keystone is cancelled, I think that will put a rift with the two levels of government."""	left
jdrava	liberal	Joe Biden makes a pledge to trans people: “I believe that Trans Lives Matter”	"Violence against transgender and gender non-conforming people, particularly Black and Brown transgender women, is an epidemic that needs national leadership.

So far this year, the Human Rights Campaign has tracked 33 transgender or gender non-conforming people who have been violently killed, including the tragic shooting of Sara Blackwood earlier this week in Indiana. This is the highest number on record with more than two months left in the year, and the vast majority are Black and Brown transgender women. It’s unacceptable.

Related: Voting deadlines, registration & what’s at stake for LGBTQ voters in 2020

These deaths don’t exist within a vacuum. Dehumanizing government actions and rhetoric as well as a failure to address risk factors like domestic and intimate partner violence, underemployment and unemployment and poverty, housing insecurity and health disparities, put this community at risk.

From banning transgender patriots from serving their country, to attempting to limit transgender people’s access to health care in the midst of a pandemic, to literally erasing the word transgender from government websites, President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have fueled the flames of transphobia in our nation while refusing to acknowledge the epidemic of violence.

Solving this epidemic of violence doesn’t just require a President who actually recognizes it as fact, but one who believes in the humanity and dignity of transgender people.

As President, I will put forward comprehensive solutions to help empower the transgender and gender non-conforming community and prioritize the prosecution of anti-transgender violence. My administration will enact the Equality Act to end legal discrimination against LGBTQ+ people, expand economic opportunities for LGBTQ+ people, reform our treatment of transgender and gender non-conforming individuals in our criminal justice system, ensure access to accurate identification documents, and improve government data collection to better track violence against the transgender community.

I believe that Trans Lives Matter and, as president, I will fight on behalf of every vulnerable person in this country.

l2qqmi	liberal	Pete Buttigieg congratulated for masterclass confirmation hearing as he’s set to be first openly gay cabinet member	"Pete Buttigieg, Biden administration nominee for secretary of transportation, speaks during a Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee confirmation hearing (Getty Images)

Pete Buttigieg was lauded for his performance at his confirmation hearing at which he appears to have gained bipartisan support from committee members.

Democratic Senator Jon Tester of Montana effusively praised Mr Buttigieg for his preparation and the detailed policy knowledge he demonstrated: “You have put on a clinic on how a nominee should work and act.”

Were Mr Buttigieg’s nomination by Joe Biden to lead the Department of Transportation to be approved, he would be the first openly gay man to be confirmed by the Senate to a cabinet post. Former President Donald Trump’s acting director of national intelligence Richard Grenell was also openly gay, but was never confirmed to his post by the Senate.

The former presidential candidate and former mayor of South Bend, Indiana began his introductory statement by introducing his husband, Chasten, at the largely convivial hearing before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.

“I'd like to take a moment to introduce my husband, Chasten Buttigieg, who's here with me today. I'm really proud to have him by my side. I also want to take this chance to thank him for his many sacrifices and his support in making it possible for me to pursue public service,” he said.

In his testimony covering a wide range of transportation and infrastructure policy issues, Mr Buttigieg said that the administration’s ambitious agenda was a “generational opportunity” to create new jobs, fight economic inequality and stem climate change. He also highlighted the importance of safety as the foundation of the department’s work.

“[There is] a lot of work to do to improve the infrastructure in this country, a mission that will not only keep more people safe, but also grow our economy as we look to the future,” the former mayor said.

Placing the Department of Transportation at the centre of this vision of infrastructure development laid out by the new president, Mr Buttigieg linked it directly to creating millions of well-paying jobs and revitalising communities that have been left behind.

Story continues

He added that it also enables American small businesses, workers, families, and farmers to compete and win in the global economy, and plays a role in tackling the climate crisis.

“Infrastructure can be the cornerstone to all of this, and you have my commitment that I will work closely with you to deliver the innovation and growth that America needs in this area,” said Mr Buttigieg.

The former mayor touted his own experience in South Bend to his understanding of the importance of infrastructure in spurring economic growth and revitalisation, while engaging stakeholders and tapping new resources to solve problems.

During questioning by committee members, Mr Buttigieg said: “This is our opportunity to do the building in ‘Build Back Better’. Every part of our transportation infrastructure needs massive investment. We have a historic opportunity to put together the resources to make those kinds of investments.”

Asked how the Biden administration plans to pay for bigger infrastructure investment, the former mayor said that the answer depends in part on the nature of the post-Covid economic recovery. He confirmed that critical federal investment in infrastructure is vital.

The only hostile question came from Senator Ted Cruz, who raised the disconnect between the Biden administration halting the Keystone XL pipeline and its stated mission to create jobs.

The unflappable nominee responded with an entreaty to cooperate to create jobs: “If you and I can make common cause for labour, then I think that’s great news”.

Committee chair Roger Wicker began by asking if Mr Buttigieg would commit to helping him restore Amtrak service to the Gulf Coast – absent since Hurricane Katrina more than 15 years ago.

Saying that he would, Mr Buttigieg also referenced the new president’s love of Amtrak: “I think as you know I'm the second biggest train enthusiast in this administration. I think Americans ought to enjoy the highest levels of passenger rail service.”

Amy Klobuchar, who sits on the committee, greeted her former presidential campaign rival, saying: “I think you know I’m excited about your nomination … I know you well, and I can attest to my colleagues what a forward-thinking and thoughtful secretary you will be.”

The senator had earlier tweeted that Mr Buttigieg has strong bipartisan support, and committee members of both parties seemed impressed by the breadth and depth of his knowledge throughout the hearing.

m48qnw	liberal	Trump's Twitter ban hurt him more than losing the election to Biden, his niece Mary says	"EXCLUSIVE: Trump's Twitter ban and losing his golf tournament hurt him more than losing the election.

Mary Trump, a psychologist who wrote a highly critical book of Donald Trump, said he ""didn't care about politics.""

Twitter permanently banned Trump after the violent siege at the Capitol in January.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Donald Trump's Twitter ban will have upset him more than losing November's presidential election to Joe Biden, his niece Mary has told Insider.

Mary Trump, a clinical psychologist who wrote a highly critical book of Donald Trump and her family, told Insider that the former president ""didn't care about politics"" and would have instead been far more upset by Twitter's decision to permanently bar him from the site as well as the PGA's decision in January to pull its 2022 championship from his golf club in Bedminster, Jersey than losing the election.

""I think that being banned from Twitter and having the PGA take their tournament away from his golf courses are probably the worst things that have happened to him in the last four years,"" she told Insider on Thursday.

""How is he managing without Twitter? Because even he must realize that people really aren't paying attention to him in the same way,"" she said.

""Clearly, this stuff with the Republican party is helping him because imagine if he didn't have that. If he had become as irrelevant as every other person who loses an election becomes, then I think his mental state would be much different.""

Her comments echo those of New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman in February, who said Trump was more unhappy when he discovered that he had lost the privilege of hosting the PGA tournament at Bedminster than he was about impeachment proceedings against him, which were ongoing at the time.

""He's angry about impeachment, people who have spoken to him say. But the reaction to the PGA decision was a different order of magnitude,"" Haberman tweeted.

Trump was permanently barred from Twitter in January after the social media platform said he risked inciting violence in the wake of the deadly Capitol insurrection.

A Politico report detailed how the president went ""ballistic"" when he lost access to Twitter, and he attempted to send tweets from different accounts before they were also shut down.

Mary Trump's tell-all book on the Trump family, ""Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man"" was published last year and sold over a million copies in the first week.

The book includes incidents Mary Trump, a clinical psychologist, observed of her uncle before he was elected as president and details the family dynamics which shaped his personality.

She is currently suing the former president and his two siblings for fraud, alleging that they swindled her out of tens of millions of dollars in inheritance money.

Mary Trump also dismissed the possibility of Trump standing for re-election in 2024, telling Insider that he was merely using the possibility of standing in order to ""keep grifting"" from his supporters.

""It's all about maintaining the grip on power. He thinks on some level it's going to allow him to continue to operate with impunity as he has done his whole life, and also it's going to allow him to keep grifting money off of people,"" she said."	left
h0z0uw	liberal	Gallup: Trump’s net approval rating drops 19 points in a month	"President Trump's approval rating has dropped from 49% to 39%, while his disapproval rating has shot up from 48% to 57%, according to the latest Gallup tracking poll out Wednesday.

Why it matters: It's the lowest net approval rating the president has recorded since October. The poll is Gallup's first since nationwide protests erupted in the wake of the killing of George Floyd.

Public anger over Floyd's killing and racial injustice has become a ""significant challenge for the president,"" according to Gallup.

Before the pandemic, Trump had enjoyed a strong economic approval rating, even as his average overall approval rating had hovered around 40%.

The 19-point plummet in the president's net approval comes as his own top advisers have been sounding the alarm over national and swing-state polling that shows him well behind Joe Biden.

By the numbers: Trump's had not recorded an overall approval rating of below 40% since October, after the House launched an impeachment inquiry.

lcj82k	liberal	Biden Ousts All 10 of Trump’s Union Busters From Powerful Labor Panel	"On Tuesday, Joe Biden demanded the resignations of all 10 of Donald Trump’s appointees to the Federal Service Impasses Panel, a powerful labor relations board, in a major victory for federal unions. Eight members resigned, and two were fired after refusing to step down. Trump’s appointees—a group of partisan anti-labor activists—had hobbled federal unions for years, sabotaging their ability to organize and bargain collectively. Biden’s clean sweep, which was first reported by Government Executive’s Erich Wagner, marks a crucial step toward ending his predecessor’s campaign of federal union busting.

The Federal Service Impasses Panel plays a major role in disputes between executive agencies and federal unions—disputes that often affect the government’s ability to administer programs fairly and lawfully. When unions and managers reach a stalemate at the bargaining table, the panel steps in to referee. It is supposed to find common ground between the parties to further the government’s official policy of promoting “collective bargaining in the civil service” and encouraging “the amicable settlements of disputes.” The panel has authority to write binding, unreviewable terms into unions’ contracts, and its members do not require Senate confirmation. Trump’s appointees consistently defied the panel’s legal obligations to remain a neutral arbiter. Instead, they displayed a clear pattern of siding with management and sometimes even imposed harsher terms than management requested. In an unprecedented and radical move, the panel even imposed terms that management did not request at all, like extending the length of an unfavorable contract. In other words, it functioned as intended: Trump stacked the panel with deeply ideological conservatives with extensive experience busting unions.

For example, Trump installed Karen M. Czarnecki, a leader of the avowedly anti-labor Mercatus Center who previously worked at the American Legislative Exchange Council (which ghostwrites anti-union legislation for Republican legislators) and the Heritage Foundation (which publicly promotes that legislation). Patrick Wright and F. Vincent Vernuccio, two more Trump appointees, work at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, an anti-union pressure group funded by the DeVos family.

Most of Trump’s appointees were affiliated with similar anti-labor groups, including the Freedom Foundation, Americans for Fair Treatment, the Goldwater Institute, the Fund for American Studies, and the Illinois Policy Institute. Others were management-side lawyers who specialize in union busting. Some appointees had questionable credentials, and many lacked any experience in mediation or arbitration. Panel member Michael Lucci, for instance, holds a B.A. in philosophy, and his official profile cryptically stated that he “completed self-directed coursework in economics” after college. (The fired members’ profiles were removed from the agency’s website on Tuesday night, but you can read an archived version here.)

Predictably, Trump’s impasses panel sided against unions at almost every turn, empowering management to crush workers’ rights during bargaining. The existence of an anti-union impasses panel undermined collective bargaining across federal agencies by discouraging managers from compromising with employees. If managers reach a deadlock, after all, they can simply get the panel to rule in their favor. Indeed, union representatives have complained that managers have bargained in bad faith by manufacturing shortcuts to the panel, where they knew they’d get everything they want and even more. The Senate Democratic Caucus backed these complaints in a furious letter to the agency’s Trump-appointed commissioner, Andrew Saul. (Biden has not yet removed Saul, who remains in control over the Social Security Administration.)

Employees at agencies throughout the executive branch have been scorched by Trump’s impasses panel. Its treatment of employees at the Social Security Administration, which oversees the country’s largest government program and operates the largest judicial system in the nation, provides a case in point. Shortly before the pandemic, the impasses panel rewrote the SSA union’s contract to roll back the agency’s teleworking program, which had increased employee efficiency. (Managers partially restored telework in 2020 several weeks after many other agencies switched to remote work.) It slashed the amount of time that workers could spend on union activities far beyond what management requested. And it abolished the agency’s responsibility to inform union members of their right to representation. To lock in these anti-union changes, the panel also extended the agreement by four years—though Biden’s new appointees should be able to reopen negotiations after overturning their predecessors’ policies.

Biden’s dismissal of the entire panel is the latest in a string of triumphs for organized labor.

The panel’s assault on the SSA union has implications for millions of Americans. Administrative law judges at the SSA hear claims for disability benefits, and because they exercise judicial powers, they are meant to be independent. Their union contract safeguards this independence from political interference. At the bargaining table, however, the SSA’s leaders stripped these safeguards from the contract—and the impasses panel backed their decision. Melissa McIntosh, president of the agency’s administrative law judge union, told me that the panel “took away our ability to protect our independence through the contract,” thereby depriving disabled Americans of their due process right to a neutral arbiter.

Trump’s appointees to the impasses panel were set to serve five-year terms, most of which will not expire until 2024 or 2025. Biden decided not to wait, cleaning house less than two weeks after taking office. (Trump, too, fired the entire panel toward the start of his presidency.) Biden can now appoint 10 replacements, who are not subject to Senate approval. He is expected to select candidates who will fulfill their duty to reach “amicable settlements” that protect federal unions from management overreach.

Biden’s dismissal of the entire panel on Tuesday is the latest in a string of triumphs for organized labor. During his first days in office, the new president promptly ousted Donald Trump’s notorious union-busters at the National Labor Relations Board, appointed a labor-friendly replacement, and reversed executive orders that had severely limited federal unions’ ability to organize and bargain.

But Biden’s work is not yet finished: The Federal Labor Relations Authority, which houses the impasses panel, remains in Republican control.

The FLRA is governed by three members who issue binding decisions about federal unions’ rights. Trump appointed Republicans Colleen Duffy Kiko and James Abbott to the agency, giving it a 2–1 Republican majority. Kiko and Abbott issued a number of “policy statements” granting more power to managers and, by extension, eroding union rights. In an unusual move, these officials spontaneously released statements altering labor law because they were too impatient to wait for an actual dispute to come before them. Trump’s appointees also gave management new powers to restrict collective bargaining. For instance, they stripped unions of their right to bargain over workplace conditions before their current agreement expires. That move was especially devastating in light of the pandemic, blocking federal unions from negotiating new health and safety rules to limit infections. Kiko even tried to abolish the FLRA’s own union of nearly 40 years.

When Biden took office, he elevated Ernest DuBester, the agency’s lone Democrat, to the chairman position, shifting some power away from the Republican majority. Still, the FLRA’s anti-union bent will continue until Biden replaces Abbott with another Democrat—which he can do almost immediately: Abbott’s term has already expired, and he can only continue serving until Biden appoints his successor (with Senate approval). Yet the new president has not named a candidate to succeed Abbott. Nor has Biden named a general counsel, a position that Trump left vacant to prevent the agency from effectively enforcing union rights.

These remaining tasks do not diminish the importance of Biden’s restoration of the impasses panel. If anything, they reveal just how much work the president must do to rid the federal government of Trump holdovers who are burrowed in. These individuals are not civil servants, but partisan activists who were selected to destroy their agencies from the inside. Ousting them is necessary to prevent the dead hand of the Trump administration from strangling the executive branch."	left

Costco has stopped stocking MyPillow's products, MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell told Insider.

Retailers have cut ties with the pillow brand after Lindell spread voter-fraud conspiracy theories.

Lindell blamed Costco's decision on ""cancel culture.""

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Costco is the latest retailer to cut ties with MyPillow, according to the pillow company's CEO, Mike Lindell.

The big-box store stopped stocking MyPillow's products without telling the pillow company about the decision, Lindell told Insider in a phone interview Monday.

Major retailers have been severing ties with MyPillow after Lindell, a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, spread voter-fraud conspiracy theories. Some of the retailers have cited slow sales.

Costco is the second-largest retailer, behind Kroger, to stop selling MyPillow products. Costco sold out its MyPillow inventory and then stopped ordering new shipments, Lindell told Insider.

He blamed the move on ""cancel culture.""

Insider reported on Saturday that MyPillow's products had disappeared from Costco's site. At the time, the company wouldn't say whether it had pulled the brand.

Costco did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

Lindell previously told Insider that at least 22 retailers had pulled his company's products since January, including Sam's Club, Kohl's, and Bed Bath & Beyond.

More than 100,000 people have also signed a petition calling on other retailers, including Amazon and Walmart, to follow suit and stop selling MyPillow's products.

Lindell said he expected the drop in retail sales to cost the company about $65 million in lost revenue this year but that radio and podcast infomercials could plug the gap.

During an appearance on ""The Domenick Nati Show"" in mid-March, Lindell said retailers who cited slow sales for cutting ties were ""lying"" and were ""big losers.""

He said calls for retailers to stop selling his products came from bots and trolls, adding that the companies who kept stocking MyPillow were ""thriving.""

Lindell added that lots of customers had been buying directly through MyPillow and that it had to hire more staff to meet demand.

l0v8ic	liberal	The Trump presidency is over, and Obamacare is still alive: Trump managed to accomplish very little on health care, despite Republicans’ decade-long obsession with repealing the Affordable Care Act.	"Mere days before his 2016 election to the presidency, Donald Trump boldly promised his voters: “When we win on November 8th and elect a Republican Congress, we will be able to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare.”

Now Trump is on his way out of the White House, and the health care law is still standing.

Trump, who had promised on the campaign trail to deliver “great health care at a tiny fraction of the cost — and it’s going to be so easy,” quickly realized how wrong he was. Republican congressional attempts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act consumed most of Trump’s first year in office. They wanted to deliver on a years-long obsession with undoing the previous president’s signature legislative achievement.

The repeal push ultimately failed with Sen. John McCain’s thumbs-down in July 2017. Though Republicans said they would make a second attempt that fall, it quickly sputtered and never came up for a vote.

Trump and Republicans failed to figure how to satisfy the outsized promises they had made. Rather than make health insurance more affordable, their plans would have shrunk federal assistance and hiked premiums for millions. Rather than cover everybody, as Trump said he wanted to do, millions of people would have lost their insurance. Rather than protect Medicaid, as the president pledged he would, their proposals would have cut hundreds of billions of dollars in spending and led to millions falling off its rolls. People with preexisting conditions would have lost the iron-clad protections that Obamacare had given them, that they would not be denied coverage or charged a higher premium because of their medical history.

“Nobody knew health care could be so complicated,” Trump said just one month into his term.

The Trump White House paid the price for its miscalculation. Democrats, campaigning heavily on preserving health care, won back the House in the 2018 midterms. The GOP’s Senate majority was lost in 2020. Biden pummeled Trump over his health care agenda and made the latter a one-term president.

Not every president passes a landmark health care bill, as Barack Obama did. But Republicans swept into power four years ago having promised to fix what they said Obama had broken. Trump said he would not only repeal and replace Obamacare, but he’d put into place ambitious plans to bring down drug prices.

The Covid-19 pandemic response was a disaster, with 400,000 Americans now dead, and the repercussions will be felt for years. That will be Trump’s legacy more than any affirmative steps his administration took to change US health care. As Trump surrenders power, what’s remarkable is how little of a mark he will leave on American health care.

“We spent four years waiting to see Trump’s health care plan, which may or may not have ever existed,” Larry Levitt, executive vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me. “His promise of ‘great’ health care was certainly never realized.”

The denouement to Trump’s failed health care record should come later this year when the US Supreme Court, of which he’s appointed a third of the members, is expected to reject the latest challenge to the ACA — a lawsuit that the Trump administration had supported.

Biden begins his term looking to quickly build on the ACA, expanding the welfare state that the outgoing president tried so hard but failed to shrink. There are still serious problems in US health care: tens of millions still uninsured and medical care left unaffordable for many others who do have an insurance card. But Biden will pick up where Obama left off, almost as if the Trump administration never happened.

Why Trump failed to change US health care

Legislation is the surest way to change US public policy for good, and Trump’s most comprehensive health care plans failed to pass Congress. Even though Republicans did succeed in repealing the individual mandate as part of their tax bill, experts were around the same time concluding that the mandate was not as essential to the law functioning as previously believed. Obamacare enrollment stayed mostly steady in the first year after the mandate penalty was zeroed out.

Trump’s record on health care is largely his administrative actions — and those are most vulnerable to being undone by the courts or the incoming Biden administration. Many of his most significant achievements already appear to be at risk.

The Trump administration approved, for the first time in history, Medicaid work requirements in several states, conditioning a person’s eligibility for health insurance on whether they are working or looking for work. But those requirements were blocked by the courts, which questioned whether they met Medicaid’s objectives as it quickly became clear that thousands of people would lose coverage.

The Supreme Court will hear a lawsuit challenging Medicaid work requirements in the coming year, and legal experts actually believe there is a chance the conservative-leaning high court will side with the lower courts and block work requirements from taking effect. Alongside the Obamacare case, the justices could spell the end to another one of Trump’s health care priorities.

A sense of desperation clearly kicked in during the final months of Trump’s term. Trump’s No. 2 health official, Seema Verma, worked overtime in the final days of the administration to ensconce some of the administration’s agenda for Medicaid. A waiver to establish Medicaid spending caps in Tennessee, also known as block grants, was approved, as were waivers proposed by conservative governors in Tennessee and Florida.

The problem, according to experts, is that these Medicaid waivers are approved at the discretion of the federal government. The Biden administration is not going to be friendly toward work requirements or block grants. Verma has tried to put in place procedural barriers to unwinding these last-minute approvals, but the consensus of experts is that Biden should be able to reverse them, though it will surely take time and a lot of paperwork.

Some of Trump’s other actions — such as cutting Obamacare outreach funding — can be nixed with the stroke of a pen. Others, like various plans to cut drug prices, have been proposed but never finalized as regulations and therefore will not actually take effect unless Biden takes them across the finish line.

This shoddy legal and regulatory work has exposed Trump’s health care policies to being quickly and permanently nullified. Even his administration’s most successful action could be weakened if Biden succeeds in passing the Covid-19 stimulus plan he has proposed.

Having failed to repeal Obamacare, the Trump health department proposed and did actually finalize a regulation expanding short-term limited-duration insurance. Those plans are not subject to the ACA’s rules about preexisting conditions and, under these new regulations, they would be allowed to last as long as three years. Trump officials portrayed them as a cheaper, free-market alternative to Obamacare, though their sales have been plagued by misleading marketing, and patients have sometimes found that these plans do not provide the level of coverage they were led to believe.

Nevertheless, enrollment in those plans did grow under Trump, up to about 3 million consumers, according to the best estimates. The merits could be debated, but the impact was real.

When I asked health policy experts about what Biden could do administratively to change health care, I was surprised when several of them said they weren’t sure whether he would be able to reverse Trump’s expansion of short-term plans. Their thinking was that the Biden team might be hesitant to yank those plans, cheap and substandard though they are, away from people without giving them an alternative.

But then Democrats won both Georgia Senate runoffs, and with them control of the Senate, and suddenly Biden’s legislative agenda had some life. As part of his Covid-19 stimulus plan, Biden is proposing to make Obamacare’s premium assistance more generous and to make more people eligible for it. People might be more willing to drop a short-term plan and sign up for Obamacare if those proposals pass and ACA-compliant plans are cheaper.

There was one Trump policy that Levitt thought could leave a lasting impression: new requirements that health care providers and insurers disclose more data about the prices paid for medical services. But there’s a twist.

“The data that will become available could shine a spotlight on how high prices are and how much they vary,” he said. “Perhaps ironically, Trump’s market-oriented price transparency regulation could help build support for more regulatory approaches to deal with high costs.”"	left

Show Caption Hide Caption Rachel Maddow warns of COVID-19 after partner's illness MSNBC's Rachel Maddow revealed that her longtime partner Susan Mikula tested positive for COVID-19. USA TODAY

A judge ordered the parent company for right-wing cable network One America News Network to pay MSNBC and host Rachel Maddow nearly $250,000 in legal fees after a failed defamation lawsuit.

Herring Networks, which owns OAN, sued MSNBC for $10 million in September 2019 following a segment on Maddow's show, in which she said OAN ""really literally is paid Russian propaganda."" The network called the claims ""malicious"" and ""utterly and completely false"" and said it had never received money from Russia or its government, according to legal documents obtained by USA TODAY.

U.S. District Judge Cynthia Bashant ruled last May that ""no set of facts that could support a claim for defamation based on Maddow's statement."" After NBC Universal, MSNBC and Maddow asked for nearly $350,000 in legal fees, the court permanently dismissed the case and on Friday awarded the defendants $247,667.50.

“This ruling reflects that One America News’ lawsuit is totally baseless, and we expect to continue to prevail on appeal,"" read a statement provided to USA TODAY by MSNBC spokesperson Lorie Acio.

OAN president Charles Herring said in a statement that the network is ""pleased that the fees were reduced by nearly a third by the court. The case is currently under appeal and we’re highly confident that we’ll receive a favorable and just ruling in the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.”

In a 2019 letter to OAN, Amy Wolf, a counselor for NBCUniversal, MSNBC's parent company, argued that Maddow's comment was a ""protected opinion based on disclosed facts"" following a Daily Beast article that reported OAN reporter Kristian Rouz was also paid to write for Sputnik, which is funded by the Russian government.

""We literally learned today that that outlet the president is promoting shares staff with the Kremlin,"" Maddow said in a July 22, 2019, episode. ""In this case, the most obsequiously pro-Trump right wing news outlet in America really literally is paid Russian propaganda. The on air U.S. politics reporter is paid by the Russian government to produce propaganda for that government.""

NBCUniversal's letter argued that ""Ms. Maddow's comment could not have been reasonably understood to mean that the Russian government made checks payable to OAN; indeed, she specifically noted who was paid by Sputnik. Use of the word 'literally' here is the kind of figure of speech that connotes opinion and thus cannot give rise to a defamation claim."""	left
hn715u	liberal	Mary Trump’s Book Has Already Leaked–a Death Knell for Trump Family’s Lawsuit	"Mary Trump’s upcoming tell-all book about the Trump family was obtained on Tuesday by several news organizations, revealing a panoply of unsavory allegations about the president and the childhood that shaped his worldview. The leaked copies of Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World’s Most Dangerous Man—which the New York Times described as “by turns a family history and a psychological analysis of her uncle”—very likely marks the effective end of the Trump family litigation aimed at stopping publication of the book.

Renowned First Amendment attorney Floyd Abrams told Law&Crime said the leaking of Mary Trump’s book does not augur well at all for the Trump family’s lawsuit, comparing their request for an injunction to the DOJ’s recently doomed attempt to halt publication of former National Security Advisor John Bolton’s memoir. (Floyd Abrams is the father of Law&Crime founder Dan Abrams.)

“As was evident from the Bolton ruling, courts are loath to issue unenforceable orders. That is especially true with respect to prior restraints on speech,” Abrams told Law&Crime. “So the more the Trump book is already out—the more the press already has it, the more the publisher has already shipped it—the less likelihood there is that a judge will issue an injunction. In this case, the chances an injunction against publication would now be issued and sustained seem to me all but non-existent.”

In denying the DOJ’s request for an injunction against Bolton’s book in June, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth specifically noted that the book had already shipped to reporters and book distributors, making any attempt to conceal the information virtually impossible.

“For reasons that hardly need to be stated, the Court will not order a nationwide seizure and destruction of a political memoir,” Lamberth wrote.

Abrams’s take on any continued efforts to stop the book’s release was echoed by Rick Hasen, the Chancellor’s Professor of Law and Political Science at the University of California, Irvine School of Law.

“Like the John Bolton book, the early leaking of the book essentially moots further attempts at prior restraint to stop publication. Key ruling was NY appellate review freeing publisher (but not Mary Trump) from restraint,” Hasen wrote, highlighting the latest and most crucial Trump family loss in court.

A New York appellate court last week ruled that Mary Trump’s publisher, Simon & Schuster, could move forward with publication of the book, reasoning that the company was not party to the 2001 confidentiality agreement that lies at the heart of the Trump family’s lawsuit. However, the court did not address whether the president’s niece could still be penalized for breaching the agreement. Put another way: Maybe there will be some financial recourse for the Trump family, but the book and details therein are already out there.

Mary Trump’s book is now scheduled to be released to the public on July 14. The release date was moved up due to “high demand and extraordinary interest,” the publisher said Monday.

jrptqh	liberal	One pollster’s explanation for why the polls got it wrong: The kind of people who answer polls are really weird, and it’s ruining polling.	"What the hell happened with the polls this year?

Yes, the polls correctly predicted that Joe Biden would win the presidency. But they got all kinds of details, and a number of Senate races, badly wrong. FiveThirtyEight’s polling models projected that Biden would win Wisconsin by 8.3 points; with basically all the votes in, he won by a mere 0.63 percent, a miss of more than 7 points. In the Maine Senate race, FiveThirtyEight estimated that Democrat Sara Gideon would beat Republican incumbent Susan Collins by 2 points; Gideon lost by 9 points, an 11-point miss.

Biden’s lead was robust enough to hold even with this kind of polling error, but the leads of candidates like Gideon (or apparently, though it’s not officially called yet, Cal Cunningham in North Carolina) were not. Not all ballots have been counted yet, which could change polling-miss estimates, but a miss is already evident in states like Wisconsin and Maine where the votes are almost all in.

To try to make sense of the massive failure of polling this year, I reached out to the smartest polling guy I know: David Shor, an independent data analyst who’s a veteran of the Obama presidential campaigns who formerly operated a massive web-based survey at Civis Analytics before leaving earlier this year. He now works advising super PACs on ad testing. Since 2016, Shor’s been trying to sell me, and basically anyone else who’ll listen, on a particular theory of what went wrong in polling that year, and what he thinks went wrong with polling in 2018 and 2020, too.

The theory is that the kind of people who answer polls are systematically different from the kind of people who refuse to answer polls — and that this has recently begun biasing the polls in a systematic way.

This challenges a core premise of polling, which is that you can use the responses of poll takers to infer the views of the population at large — and that if there are differences between poll takers and non-poll takers, they can be statistically “controlled” for by weighting according to race, education, gender, and so forth. (Weighting increases and decreases the importance of responses from particular groups in a poll to better match their share of the actual population.) If these two groups do differ systematically, that means the results are biased.

The assumption that poll respondents and non-respondents are basically similar, once properly weighted, used to be roughly right — and then, starting in 2016, it became very, very wrong. People who don’t answer polls, Shor argues, tend to have low levels of trust in other people more generally. These low-trust folks used to vote similarly to everyone else. But as of 2016, they don’t: they tend to vote for Republicans.

Now, in 2020, Shor argues that the differences between poll respondents and non-respondents have gotten larger still. In part due to Covid-19 stir-craziness, Democrats, and particularly highly civically engaged Democrats who donate to and volunteer for campaigns, have become likelier to answer polls. It’s something to do when we’re all bored, and it feels civically useful. This biased the polls, Shor argues, in deep ways that even the best polls (including his own) struggled to account for.

Liberal Democrats answered more polls, so the polls overrepresented liberal Democrats and their views (even after weighting), and thus the polls gave Biden and Senate Democrats inflated odds of winning.

Shor and I talked over Zoom on November 5 about the 2020 polling miss, how he’s trying to prevent it from happening again (at least with his own survey), and why qualitative research is vulnerable to these same problems. A transcript, edited for length and clarity, follows.

Dylan Matthews

So, David: What the hell happened with the polls this year?

David Shor

So the basic story is that, particularly after Covid-19, Democrats got extremely excited and had very high rates of engagement. They were donating at higher rates, etc., and this translated to them also taking surveys, because they were locked at home and didn’t have anything else to do. There’s some pretty clear evidence that that’s nearly all of it: It was partisan non-response. Democrats just started taking a bunch of surveys [when they were called by pollsters, while Republicans did not].

Just to put some numbers on that, if you look at the early vote results and compare it with the crosstabs of what public polls said early voters were going to be, it’s pretty clear that early voters were considerably less Democratic than people thought. Campaign pollsters can actually join survey takers to voter files, and starting in March, the percentage of our survey takers who were, say, ActBlue donors skyrocketed. The average social trust of respondents went up, core attitudes changed — basically, liberals just started taking surveys at really high rates. That’s what happened.

Dylan Matthews

You mentioned social trust. Walk me through your basic theory about how people who agree to take surveys have higher levels of social trust, and how that has biased the polls in recent years.

David Shor

For three cycles in a row, there’s been this consistent pattern of pollsters overestimating Democratic support in some states and underestimating support in other states. This has been pretty consistent. It happened in 2018. It happened in 2020. And the reason that’s happening is because the way that [pollsters] are doing polling right now just doesn’t work.

Poll Twitter tends to ascribe these mystical powers to these different pollsters. But they’re all doing very similar things. Fundamentally, every “high-quality public pollster” does random digit dialing. They call a bunch of random numbers, roughly 1 percent of people pick up the phone, and then they ask stuff like education, and age, and race, and gender, sometimes household size. And then they weight it up to the census, because the census says how many adults do all of those things. That works if people who answer surveys are the same as people who don’t, once you control for age and race and gender and all this other stuff.

But it turns out that people who answer surveys are really weird. They’re considerably more politically engaged than normal. I put in a five-factor test [a kind of personality survey] and they have much higher agreeableness [a measure of how cooperative and warm people are], which makes sense, if you think about literally what’s happening.

They also have higher levels of social trust. I use the General Social Survey’s question, which is, “Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you can’t be too careful in dealing with people?” The way the GSS works is they hire tons of people to go get in-person responses. They get a 70 percent response rate. We can basically believe what they say.

It turns out, in the GSS, that 70 percent of people say that people can’t be trusted. And if you do phone surveys, and you weight, you will get that 50 percent of people say that people can be trusted. It’s a pretty massive gap. [Sociologist] Robert Putnam actually did some research on this, but people who don’t trust people and don’t trust institutions are way less likely to answer phone surveys. Unsurprising! This has always been true. It just used to not matter.

It used to be that once you control for age and race and gender and education, that people who trusted their neighbors basically voted the same as people who didn’t trust their neighbors. But then, starting in 2016, suddenly that shifted. If you look at white people without college education, high-trust non-college whites tended toward [Democrats], and low-trust non-college whites heavily turned against us. In 2016, we were polling this high-trust electorate, so we overestimated Clinton. These low-trust people still vote, even if they’re not answering these phone surveys.

Dylan Matthews

So that’s 2016. Same story in 2018 and 2020?

David Shor

The same biases happened again in 2018, which people didn’t notice because Democrats won anyway. What’s different about this cycle is that in 2016 and 2018, the national polls were basically right. This time, we’ll see when all the ballots get counted, but the national polls were pretty wrong. If you look at why, I think the answer is related, which is that people who answer phone surveys are considerably more politically engaged than the overall population.

If you match to vote history, literally 95 percent of people who answer phone surveys vote. That’s the problem with “likely voter screens” [which try to improve polls by limiting them to the likeliest respondents to vote]. If you restrict to people who have never voted in an election before, 70 percent of phone survey takers vote. If you restrict to people who say they will definitely not vote, 76 percent of those people vote.

Normally that doesn’t matter, because political engagement is actually not super correlated with partisanship. That is normally true, and if it wasn’t, polling would totally break. In 2020, they broke. There were very, very high levels of political engagement by liberals during Covid. You can see in the data it really happened around March. Democrats’ public Senate polling started surging in March. Liberals were cooped up, because of Covid, and so they started answering surveys more and being more engaged.

This gets to something that’s really scary about polling, which is that polling is fundamentally built on this assumption that people who answer surveys are the same as people who don’t, once you condition on enough things. That can be true at any given time. But these things that we’re trying to measure are constantly changing. And so you can have a method that worked in past cycles suddenly break.

Dylan Matthews

Why can’t you just fix that by weighting? Why not just control the results by sexual orientation or religion to get around that problem?

David Shor

You can know from the GSS, say, how many people nationwide have low levels of social trust. But that doesn’t tell you — what about likely voters? Or what about likely voters in Ohio’s 13th Congressional District? How does that break out by race or gender or education? How does that interact with turnout? All that stuff becomes quite hard.

There’s a reason pollsters don’t weight by everything. Say you have 800 responses. The more variables you weight by, the lower your effective sample size is. Once the number of things you control for increases past a certain point, traditional techniques start to fail and you need to start doing machine learning and modeling.

This is the bigger point about the industry I’m trying to make. There used to be a world where polling involved calling people, applying classical statistical adjustments, and putting most of the emphasis on interpretation. Now you need voter files and proprietary first-party data and teams of machine learning engineers. It’s become a much harder problem.

Dylan Matthews

One reaction I’ve seen from several quarters is that 2020 shows that quantitative methods aren’t enough to understand the electorate, and pollsters need to do more to incorporate ethnographic techniques, deep interviews, etc. In a way, you’re proposing the opposite: Pollsters need to get way more sophisticated in their quantitative methods to overcome the biases that wrecked the polls this year. Am I understanding that right?

David Shor

I mean, I’m not a robot. Qualitative research and interpretation are important for winning elections. But I think it’s a misunderstanding of why polls were wrong.

A lot of people think that the reason why polls were wrong was because of “shy Trump voters.” You talk to someone, they say they’re undecided, or they say they’re gonna vote for Biden, but it wasn’t real. Then, maybe if you had a focus group, they’d say, “I’m voting for Biden, but I don’t know.” And then your ethnographer could read the uncertainty and decide, “Okay, this isn’t really a firm Biden voter.” That kind of thing is very trendy as an explanation.

But it’s not why the polls were wrong. It just isn’t. People tell the truth when you ask them who they’re voting for. They really do, on average. The reason why the polls are wrong is because the people who were answering these surveys were the wrong people. If you do your ethnographic research, if you try to recruit these focus groups, you’re going to have the same biases. They recruit focus groups by calling people! Survey takers are weird. People in focus groups are even weirder. Qualitative research doesn’t solve the problem of one group of people being really, really excited to share their opinions, while another group isn’t. As long as that bias exists, it’ll percolate down to whatever you do."	left

j3xppi	liberal	Joe Biden has tested negative for coronavirus after debate with Trump; Biden has been strict about mask-wearing and social distancing at his in-person campaign events.	"Democratic nominee Joe Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, have both tested negative for the coronavirus, his campaign has confirmed.

There were fears Biden had been exposed to the coronavirus at Tuesday’s presidential debate in Cleveland, when he appeared onstage with President Donald Trump. Trump and first lady Melania Trump have both tested positive for the coronavirus, the president announced in a tweet early Friday morning. While it sometimes takes several days for a person to test positive after contracting the virus, the Bidens have initially tested negative.

“Vice President Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden underwent PCR testing for COVID-19 today and COVID-19 was not detected,” said the Bidens’ doctor Dr. Kevin O’Connor in a statement. “I am reporting this out in my capacity as both Vice President Biden and Dr. Biden’s primary care physician.”

The Biden campaign has not been informed of possible coronavirus exposure by the White House or the Trump campaign, a senior Biden campaign official told CNN and NBC.

Biden tweeted his well-wishes to the president and first lady on Friday morning.

Jill and I send our thoughts to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a swift recovery. We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 2, 2020

It’s so far unclear if Trump was contagious during the debate. Biden’s and Trump’s podiums were spaced far apart on the debate stage, which helps reduce the likelihood of exhaled droplets from Trump being inhaled by Biden.

Biden has also been diligent about wearing a mask at his campaign events and public appearances, a fact Trump mocked him for at Tuesday’s debate.

Biden’s campaign has been doing in-person events for a few months, but all events have had small numbers of attendees, all of whom are carefully spaced 6 feet apart and wearing masks. The Bidens have been on a train tour of Midwestern states following Tuesday’s debate.

The former vice president has also been taking extra personal precautions since this spring, following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations for limiting one’s exposure to the virus.

“I wash my hands God knows how many times a day with hot water and soap,” Biden said this spring. “I carry with me … as a matter of fact, I have it in my bag outside here … hand sanitizer. I don’t know how many times a day I use that. I make sure I don’t touch my face, and so on. So I’m taking all the precautions we’ve told everybody else to take.”

During a spring Democratic primary debate, Biden told CNN’s moderators that even though he is 77 years old, he does not have any underlying health conditions like diabetes, or heart or lung disease, that can lead to more serious complications.

“Fortunately I don’t have any of the underlying conditions that you talked about, number one,” Biden said. “Number two, thank God — for the time being, anything can happen, knock on wood — I’m in good health.”"	left
jzsv5w	liberal	Michigan's state board certifies Biden's win	"(CNN) The Michigan State Board of Canvassers voted Monday to certify the state's election results, formally granting President-elect Joe Biden the state's 16 electoral votes -- and all but erasing any pathway for President Donald Trump's to overturn the election results through legal challenges that have been dismissed in key states.

One of the two Republican members of the Michigan state canvassing board, Aaron Van Langevelde, joined the two Democrats to vote to certify the election results, after it was unclear how he would vote prior to the meeting.

The question of certifying Michigan's election results moved center stage amid the Trump campaign's dubious claims of voter fraud and efforts in court to delay certification and overturn the election results in several key states that voted for Biden.

The state's highly-anticipated certification was the latest in a series of episodes over the past week that have reinforced Biden's victory, even as Trump has refused to concede. The President instead spread wild false conspiracy theories about the election and invited Michigan state GOP lawmakers to the White House while his allies and legal advisers suggested the legislature should overturn the popular vote result -- something they do not have the power to do.

Also on Monday, the General Services Administration informed Biden that the Trump administration is ready to begin the formal transition process , according to a letter from Administrator Emily Murphy obtained by CNN. The letter is the first step the administration has taken to acknowledge Trump's defeat, more than two weeks after Biden was declared the winner in the election.

In Pennsylvania, the state Supreme Court on Monday rejected the Trump campaign's effort to block the counting of certain absentee ballots -- clearing the way for votes to be certified in multiple counties, including Philadelphia. That came after the Trump campaign's lawsuit on Saturday seeking to invalidate millions of Pennsylvania votes was dismissed by a federal judge in a withering decision

Last week, Georgia's Republican governor and secretary of state certified the state's election results , though the Trump campaign requested a second recount following an audit that was completed prior to certification. Officials said they expect that to be completed by next week, before a crucial December 8 deadline for states to name their slates of electors.

After Michigan's Republican state legislative leaders visited with Trump at the White House last week, they issued a statement saying, ""We have not yet been made aware of any information that would change the outcome of the election.""

A Biden spokesman said of the Michigan election results, ""We appreciate the state board's recognition of the plain facts: President-elect Joe Biden resoundingly won the state of Michigan by more than 150,000 votes -- 14 times the margin of Donald Trump in 2016.""

The Trump campaign said it wasn't done fighting the election result.

""Certification by state officials is simply a procedural step,"" said Trump campaign legal adviser Jenna Ellis. ""We are going to continue combatting election fraud around the country as we fight to count all the legal votes. Americans must be assured that the final results are fair and legitimate.""

Michigan votes to certify

There was uncertainty swirling over the Michigan canvassing board meeting on Monday. The board is made of up two Democrats and two Republicans, and one of the Republican board members signaled he would oppose certifying the election result.

Aaron Van Langevelde, the other Republican board member, had not tipped his hand before the meeting, but he signaled how he would vote quickly after it got underway. Van Langevelde said that he believed he was required to certify the vote under state law, regardless of whether he believed there should be an audit of Wayne County's election results. He supported an audit, he said, but that did not mean the board should wait to certify the election first.

""We must not attempt to exercise power we don't have,"" he said.

Norman Shinkle, the second GOP board member, abstained from the final vote. He argued that the board should not certify the election results until an investigation into voting in Wayne County -- the state's largest, which includes Detroit -- was completed. Shinkle asked the Republican-led Michigan legislature to create a bipartisan commission to conduct a review of the 2020 election, which all board members backed, in a moment of bipartisanship. The legislature has already launched an investigation into the state's election, conducted by the House and Senate Joint Oversight Committee.

While Democratic board member Julie Matuzak supported certification, she did make a call for the state's election system to be modernized. Matuzak said that while she did not believe there was any fraud in the November election, the state needed to allow for the processing of absentee ballots earlier, modernize how poll workers and poll challengers are trained, and allow for unbalanced precincts to be recounted in order to eliminate some of the human error that still exists.

'The law is pretty clear here'

Before the vote, the board heard from election officials like local clerks, campaign lawyers and other experts, which Van Langevelde requested before voting. He revealed his viewpoint of the rules that govern the board through his debate the board's role with an attorney for GOP Senate candidate John James, who argued the canvassing board could adjourn and wait for the results of an audit before certifying the results.

""I found nothing about authority for us to delay certification"" he said. ""I found nothing that gives us the authority to review complaints fraud. I mean, I think the law is pretty clear here, and again this board has such limited authority.""

Shinkle sought at the meeting to ask questions of Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey, who initially was not slated to speak but appeared via video, like other witnesses, after a brief recess. Shinkle asked whether the city had hired sufficient Republican poll workers for the election as required under state law, claiming Republicans who sought to work the polls were denied.

Winfrey responded that the city had hired as many Republicans as it could, but those who applied too late were not allowed to take the job.

Republican and Democratic state and local officials appeared via video to speak at the meeting. When one Republican repeated debunked conspiracy theories about the vote count, one of the Democratic board members asked whether the allegations had been submitted to the attorney general, because the canvassing board could not investigate those claims.

Brendan Flynn, who was a poll challenger at the TCF Center in Detroit where absentee ballots were counted, spoke to what he observed on Election Day. ""The only disruptions I observed the entire day were from GOP challengers, who had difficulty following the rules"" Flynn said. ""The bottom line was there was nothing irregular or fraudulent about what I observed at the TCF center on November 3.""

Trump has refused to concede

This was not the first drama-filled meeting over the typically pro-forma certification of election results in Michigan. Last week, the Republican canvassing board members in Wayne County initially voted against certification, blocking certification, before voting in favor hours later after a public uproar. The GOP board members received a call from Trump that night, and the following day they filed affidavits seeking to rescind their votes, which they could not do.

The Trump campaign has tried to interfere with the certification process through lawsuits, and Trump has courted Michigan officials as he and attorney Rudy Giuliani continue to claim without evidence widespread voter fraud and a ""rigged election.""

Trump met with Republican Michigan state lawmakers at the White House last week and state Republican leadership, who brought a letter asking for additional Covid-19 relief funding and said after the meeting that they did not see anything that would change the state's election result.

The Republican National Committee and Michigan Republican Party sent a letter to the board of canvassers on Saturday asking them to delay certification for 14 days. They also asked for them to wait for an audit of the election results in Wayne County, the largest county in the state that includes Detroit -- even though state law doesn't allow that.

After the state board certified the election result Monday, GOP Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, who met with Trump last week, thanked the canvassing board. ""The Senate will honor their unanimous request to closely review Michigan's elections process to identify much-needed improvements,"" he said."	left

Donald Trump Jr is wanted for questioning as part of an investigation into the alleged misuse of his father’s 2017 presidential inauguration funds.

Washington DC attorney general Karl Racine said Mr Trump Jr had been notified of the request, which was sent after new evidence emerged in court filings earlier this week.

They allege that the Presidential Inaugural Committee “improperly wasted its fund” when it paid almost $50,000 (£37,000) to the Loews Madison for a block of hotel rooms on behalf of the Trump Organization.

The reservation was arranged by Mr Trump Jr’s personal assistant, the court filings claim, and the rooms appeared to have been given to a personal friend of the president’s eldest son.

The incident emerged as part of the DC attorney general’s wider probe into the alleged misuse of more than $1 million (£733,000) by the Presidential Inaugural Committee, which is accused of “grossly overpaying” for event space at the Trump International Hotel in DC during the inauguration.

In January the attorney general’s office announced it was suing the committee and the Trump Organization over the payments.

Mr Racine told CNN on Thursday he was “extremely confident” Mr Trump Jr and the wider Trump family had broken the law.

“We’re before a court and at the end of the day the court will decide, but the evidence is clear. The Trump business and the Trump family used the not-for-profit to profit themselves,” Mr Racine said.

“That’s why the presidential inauguration commission paid so much money for rooms and event space that were far above market rate during the inauguration, and that’s why we just amended our complaint to include that Donald Trump Jr’s good friend essentially had a free set of rooms for a period of time during the inauguration for no good not-for-profit purpose.

“That’s not consistent with the law, that’s why we’re going to pursue that.”

The Trump Organisation has been contacted for comment.

hi4eva	liberal	Reddit Finally Bans Hate Speech, Removes 2,000 Racist and Violent Forums Including The_Donald	"Reddit first launched as an online discussion site in June 2005. Now, 15 years later, it has finally taken action to officially ban hate speech and groups that promote it.

A revised Reddit content policy, announced Monday, explicitly states that groups or users that “incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability” are prohibited. “Everyone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying and threats of violence,” it says.

With the updated content policy, Reddit is initially banning about 2,000 subreddits, most of which are inactive, the company said. Included in the purge is The_Donald, a pro-Donald Trump forum notorious for users posting racist, misogynistic, anti-Islam and anti-Semitic content. At one point, The_Donald had nearly 800,000 active users.

In 2015, Reddit adopted a new content policy and banned several blatantly racist subreddits. But until today, the official rules still did not explicitly forbid hate or racist forums.

Reddit CEO/co-founder Steve Huffman, in an post about the new policy, said “I admit we have fallen short” in supporting the site’s communities and moderators with respect to adopting a comprehensive anti-hate policy.

“We are committed to working with you to combat the bad actors, abusive behaviors, and toxic communities that undermine our mission and exist solely to get in the way of the creativity, discussions, and communities that bring us all to Reddit in the first place,” Huffman wrote.

Reddit provided examples of hateful activities that would violate the rule:

A post describing a racial minority as subhuman and inferior to the racial majority.

A post arguing that rape of women should be acceptable and not a crime.

A meme saying it is sickening that people of color have the right to vote.

A subreddit group dedicated to mocking people with physical disabilities.

“All communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith,” Huffman wrote. The company banned The_Donald “because it has not done so, despite every opportunity. The community has consistently hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average” as well as “antagonized

us and other communities.” The smaller ChapoTrapHouse was banned for similar reasons.

Both The_Donald and ChapoTrapHouse already had been “quarantined” by the site in 2019. According to Reddit, that means they were “restricted due to significant issues with reporting and addressing violations of Reddit’s rules against violence and other aspects of the Content Policy.” Reddit’s quarantining penalty puts a warning in front of subreddits, prevents them from generating revenue, and excludes their posts from appearing in search and recommendations.

Of the 2,000 subreddits removed for hate speech, only 10% have more than 10 active daily users, according to Reddit. The 10 most active groups among those banned (in addition to The_Donald and ChapoTrapHouse) are: darkhumorandmemes; consumeproduct; darkjokecentral; gendercritical; cumtown; imgoingtohellforthis2; wojak; and soyboys.

The latest move by Reddit comes after years of critics calling for the site crack down on hate speech, and amid nationwide protests for racial justice after the police killing of George Floyd.

Earlier this month, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian resigned from the board and urged Reddit to select a Black candidate to replace him. Five days later, Reddit named Michael Seibel, a Black venture-capital investor and adviser, to the board of directors in Ohanian’s place.

The new Reddit policy banning hate speech defines “marginalized or vulnerable groups” as including those “based on their actual and perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, immigration status, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy, or disability.” It also specifically includes “victims of a major violent event and their families,” such as parents of kids killed the 2012 mass shooting at Connecticut’s Sandy Hook Elementary School, who have been targeted by right-wing conspiracy theorists bizarrely claiming the attack was a hoax.

However, according to Reddit, the hate-speech ban “does not protect all groups or all forms of identity.” The site says, for example, that “the rule does not protect groups of people who are in the majority or who promote such attacks of hate.”

Reddit’s updated content policy also spells out a new requirement that users “abide by community rules,” asking them to, as Huffman put it, “post with authentic, personal interest.” The rule prohibits activity intended to “cheat or engage in content manipulation” in a subreddit, including spamming, vote manipulation, ban evasion, or subscriber fraud, as well as anything else to “interfere with or disrupt Reddit communities.”

Reddit said it averaged more than 430 million monthly visitors and 21 billion monthly page views as of the end of 2019."	left

“The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history. Right now, across the country, election officials are reviewing and double checking the entire election process prior to finalizing the result.

“When states have close elections, many will recount ballots. All of the states with close results in the 2020 presidential race have paper records of each vote, allowing the ability to go back and count each ballot if necessary. This is an added benefit for security and resilience. This process allows for the identification and correction of any mistakes or errors. There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.

“Other security measures like pre-election testing, state certification of voting equipment, and the U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s (EAC) certification of voting equipment help to build additional confidence in the voting systems used in 2020.

“While we know there are many unfounded claims and opportunities for misinformation about the process of our elections, we can assure you we have the utmost confidence in the security and integrity of our elections, and you should too. When you have questions, turn to elections officials as trusted voices as they administer elections.”

kbetuq	liberal	Supreme Court rejects Texas' and Trump's bid to overturn election	"(CNN) The Supreme Court on Friday rejected a bid from Texas' attorney general -- supported by President Donald Trump -- to block the ballots of millions of voters in battleground states that went in favor of President-elect Joe Biden.

The court's order, issued with no public dissents, to dismiss the challenge is the strongest indication yet that Trump has no chance of overturning election results in court, and that even the justices whom he placed there have no interest in allowing his desperate legal bids to continue.

The Electoral College will convene Monday to affirm Biden's win.

The lawsuit, brought by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton , a staunch Trump ally, sought to sue Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia and Wisconsin -- which all went for Biden -- and invalidate their election results. And this week, with his options narrowing, Trump, accompanied by the support of several Republican attorneys general and GOP lawmakers, cranked up pressure to have the Supreme Court weigh in.

""From a legal perspective, the fat lady has sung,"" said Steve Vladeck, a CNN Supreme Court analyst and University of Texas Law professor.

Trump and his legal team -- hamstrung by a series of coronavirus diagnoses among lawyers who had traveled across the country advocating on behalf of Trump's case -- have for weeks pushed increasingly desperate appeals and baseless conspiracy theories about his second term being stolen.

""The Supreme Court really let us down. No Wisdom, No Courage!,"" Trump tweeted around midnight. Mike Gwin, a spokesman for Biden's campaign, said the decision was ""no surprise.""

Paxton, calling the court's order ""unfortunate,"" vowed to fight on.

""I will continue to tirelessly defend the integrity and security of our elections and hold accountable those who shirk established election law for their own convenience,"" he said in a statement.

Republican election lawyer Ben Ginsberg said Trump's crusade to undermine the election's results through rhetoric and court challenges ""put a huge stress test on our democracy.""

""The Republicans who did follow Donald Trump really have an obligation now to make the country strong again, to heal the chinks that Donald Trump tried to put in the foundation of the country and the democracy,"" Ginsberg told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room.""

Texas denied for lack of standing

The court's order Friday night was unsigned, and court did not provide a vote count, but there were no dissents to the order made public.

In its short order, the court said that Texas had not demonstrated that it had the legal right to bring the suit because it had not demonstrated a ""judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections.""

The order states: ""The State of Texas's motion for leave to file a bill of complaint is denied for lack of standing under Article III of the Constitution. Texas has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections. All other pending motions are dismissed as moot.""

In a statement accompanying the order, Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas said they would have allowed the case to be filed, but would grant no other relief.

""Even Justice Thomas and Alito, who might otherwise have been sympathetic to these challenges, went out of their way to express that they would grant no relief on the merits,"" Vladeck said.

""Not only did the Court reject Texas's effort to challenge the results in four battleground states, but it did so on a ground that will prevent any other states from doing so,"" Vladeck added.

Another big loss for Trump

For the past five weeks, federal and state courts have rejected most of Trump's attempts thoroughly.

Hastily-written filings have contained a multitude of elementary errors. Many of the pro-Trump arguments hinged on what was ultimately hearsay or conjecture. And in many of the cases, Trump backers have said they don't have evidence proving their allegations yet, but want to review ballots or confidential elections data more closely to see if they can find proof of fraud.

Multiple sources told CNN earlier this week that Trump's legal team and inside what remains of his campaign staff have been sensing that efforts to overturn or delay the results of the election are coming to an end. White House staffers are resigning or are out the door, and members of Trump's Cabinet have also begun meeting with their Biden administration counterparts.

First lady Melania Trump, meanwhile, has begun overseeing shipments of family furniture and art to Mar-a-Lago. And Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner are in the final stages of purchasing a plot of land within a Miami enclave known for its privacy and high net worth residents.

Presidential pressure

Hours ahead of the court's decision, the President called on the Supreme Court to intervene in the election, but seemed to acknowledge that a Biden administration is on its way.

""Now that the Biden Administration will be a scandal plagued mess for years to come, it is much easier for the Supreme Court of the United States to follow the Constitution and do what everybody knows has to be done. They must show great Courage & Wisdom. Save the USA!!!"" Trump tweeted Friday morning.

Each of the four battleground states targeted by the lawsuit -- Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- issued blistering briefs on Thursday , with Pennsylvania officials going so far as to call the effort a ""seditious abuse of the judicial process.""

And although the case started off with Texas challenging four states, it grew into a dispute featuring some 19 Republican attorneys general siding with Texas and 22 Democratic-led states and territories supporting the battleground states that Biden won.

In addition, 126 House Republicans signed on to an amicus brief in support of Paxton's motion, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.

Still, several Republican lawmakers in Washington slammed the basis of the suit, citing federalism concerns and saying Texas shouldn't have a say in how other states hold their elections.

hzgzs2	liberal	Trump was never invited by the Yankees to throw the ceremonial first pitch.	"On Thursday, July 23, before the Opening Day game between the New York Yankees and Washington Nationals, President Donald Trump announced he would be throwing out the first pitch at a Yankees-Red Sox game at Yankee Stadium in August.

Speaking from the White House, Trump said he accepted an offer from Yankees president Randy Levine.

“Randy Levine’s a great friend of mine from the Yankees,” Trump said. “He asked me to throw out the first pitch. And I think I’m doing that on August 15 at Yankee Stadium. And I said, ‘How’s the crowd going to be?' And, it’s like, ‘You don’t have a crowd. There’s no such thing.' It’s gonna be interesting.”

Buy coronavirus face coverings: MLB, NFL, NBA, NHL, NCAA

Three days later, Trump said he had to decline the offer.

“Because of my strong focus on the China Virus,” Trump tweeted, referring to the coronavirus, “including scheduled meetings on Vaccines, our economy and much else, I won’t be able to be in New York to throw out the opening pitch for the @Yankees on August 15th. We will make it later in the season!”

However there is a new angle to Trump’s first pitch decision. The New York Times reports Trump never received an offer from the Yankees to play ball on Aug. 15: Mr. Trump had not actually been invited on that day by the Yankees, according to one person with knowledge of Mr. Trump’s schedule. His announcement surprised both Yankees officials and the White House staff.

According to the New York Times, Trump’s first pitch announcement was motivated by the fact that Dr. Anthony Fauci was throwing out the first pitch on Opening Day at Nationals Park before the game between Yankees and Nationals:

Mr. Trump had been so annoyed by Dr. Fauci’s turn in the limelight, an official familiar with his reaction said, that he had directed his aides to call Yankees officials and make good on a longtime standing offer from Mr. Levine to throw out an opening pitch. No date was ever finalized.

Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is the leading immunologist in the country and the face of the Trump administration’s fight against COVID-19.

hguskn	liberal	Trump Knew Russia Offered Taliban Bounties to Kill US Soldiers	"President Donald Trump has known for months of a Russian military intelligence campaign to offer secret bounties to Taliban militias for killing US soldiers in Afghanistan.

According to an exposé in the New York Times citing US intelligence officials, the president was notified of the bounty campaign in late March and discusses a range of possible responses, but has still yet to confront the Russians about the targeting of American troops.

“Islamist militants, or armed criminal elements closely associated with them, are believed to have collected some bounty money,” the Times reported. “Twenty Americans were killed in combat in Afghanistan in 2019, but it was not clear which killings were under suspicion.”

“An operation to incentivize the killing of American and other NATO troops would be a significant and provocative escalation of what American and Afghan officials have said is Russian support for the Taliban,” the story noted. “It would be the first time the Russian spy unit was known to have orchestrated attacks on Western troops.”

The news of a coordinated attempt to kill US troops via Taliban insurgents comes amid the administration’s ongoing attempts at striking a peace deal with the Taliban and drawing down of the combat force’s footprint nearly 19 years after the war in Afghanistan began.

“The officials familiar with the intelligence did not explain the White House delay in deciding how to respond to the intelligence about Russia,” per the Times. “They said the intelligence has been treated as a closely held secret, but the administration expanded briefings about it this week — including sharing information about it with the British government, whose forces are among those said to have been targeted.”

The House is now set to take it up again next week, this time with a slim majority in the Senate.

The bill would expand opportunities to vote by mail, require states to establish electronic voter registration, and would make Election Day a federal holiday.

It would also give the Justice Department greater powers to step in and enforce voting rights.

Along with campaign finance reform measures, it would also require states to use independent redistricting commissions, a move that often takes the power to draw political boundaries out of the hands of state legislators.

iiu29j	liberal	CNN fact-checked Trump’s RNC speech on air. It took 3 minutes. | Trump’s RNC speech averaged a false or misleading claim every 3 minutes.	"President Donald Trump on Thursday spoke for more than an hour at the Republican National Convention — giving him plenty of time to try to spin his presidency’s record positively and, it turns out, get a lot of things wrong.

CNN reporter Daniel Dale, who’s made a name for himself for fact-checking Trump, went on the network with a preliminary fact-check of the president — counting more than 20 false or misleading claims in Trump’s RNC speech, which would amount to one false or misleading claim about every three minutes. Dale proceeded to list those errors on the air, which took three minutes:

“This president is a serial liar, and he serially lied tonight,” Dale said.

Here’s the full list of errors, as recited by Dale:

“Trump said Joe Biden is ‘talking about taking down the border wall.’ Biden has specifically, explicitly rejected that idea. He just said he’ll stop further additional construction.” “Trump claimed, as always, that he is the one who passed the veterans’ choice law. Barack Obama signed that into law in 2014. Trump signed a 2018 law to modify it.” “Trump said, ‘I have done more for the African American community than any president since Abraham Lincoln.’ That is ludicrous. Lyndon Johnson, for one, signed the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act.” “Trump again touted a ‘record 9 million job gain over the past three months.’ He didn’t mention, as usual, that that gain follows a record 22 million job loss over the previous two months.” “He said he’ll ‘continue to lower drug prices.’ They’ve increased during his presidency.” “He said they opened a Jerusalem embassy for less than $500,000. Early documents show it was at least $21 million.” “He claimed NATO member spending has increased for the first time in about 20 years. Spending, in fact, rose in 2015 and in 2016, before he took office.” “He said he will always, and Republicans will always, strongly protect people with preexisting conditions. That pledge has already been broken. He and they have repeatedly tried to weaken those protections in Obamacare.” “He claimed again that he banned travel from China and Europe. No, he imposed partial restrictions with many exemptions. Tens of thousands of people continued traveling over.” “He boasted about the Covid testing system and about his general response. Look, experts nearly universally say the US was fatally slow in its response, especially slow in setting up adequate testing.” “He said he ended what he called ‘a NAFTA nightmare’ and he signed a brand new US-Mexico-Canada agreement — the USMCA. That agreement preserves, maintains most of NAFTA.” “He boasted about building about 300 miles of border wall. What he didn’t say is that most of that is replacement barrier. As of August 7, according to official data, just 5 miles had been built where none existed before.” “He suggested Joe Biden would confiscate guns. That’s baseless. Biden is running on a non-mandatory buyback of so-called assault weapons.” “He said Democrats want to defund the police. Biden, again, doesn’t, has rejected that.” “He said he has ‘very good information’ that China wants Biden to win because Biden is soft on China or cheerleads for China. The US intelligence community says China wants Biden to win because it sees Trump as unpredictable.” “He said Biden vowed to close down charter schools. Biden’s plan is skeptical on charters, but would not abolish them entirely.” “He denounced Biden for voting for the Iraq War. Biden did indeed vote for the Iraq War. But what Trump doesn’t mention is that he also supported that invasion.” “He said Democrats twice removed the word ‘God’ from the Pledge of Allegiance at their convention. Two individual caucus meetings outside the main primetime programming did leave it out, but it was uttered in every primetime event.” “Trump denounced so-called cancel culture as an insidious, left-wing thing. He, Donald J. Trump, has tried to get dozens of people and entities canceled, fired, boycotted, including literally, last week, Goodyear.” “He said he imposed an order to give 10 years in prison to rioters. That’s a maximum discretionary sentence up to judges, in existing laws. His order just asked the government to fully enforce.” “He said Biden’s plan would eliminate America’s borders. No. Just no. It’s wrong.”

It’s quite the list, but this level of lying and misleading isn’t new to Trump. According to the Washington Post, Trump has now made more than 20,000 public false or misleading claims since he assumed office.

As my colleague Matt Yglesias has argued, there’s something more to this than just lying — it’s bullshitting. Here’s Princeton University philosophy professor Harry Frankfurt, explaining the concept:

For the bullshitter, however, all these bets are off: he is neither on the side of the true nor on the side of the false. His eye is not on the facts at all, as the eyes of the honest man and of the liar are, except insofar as they may be pertinent to his interest in getting away with what he says. He does not care whether the things he says describe reality correctly. He just picks them out, or makes them up, to suit his purpose.

It’s not just that Trump is lying. It’s that Trump doesn’t seem to care at all for the truth. What he says is only meant to make him look good. That’s the context in which Trump claims time and time again that he’s passed laws he never passed and built border walls he never built.

And so when the president speaks, it’s perpetually difficult to say if he’s telling the truth or merely reciting self-serving bullshit.

mrmrmn	liberal	Nancy Pelosi Reveals Mitch McConnell Blocked Ruth Bader Ginsburg From Getting Capitol Rotunda Memorial	"Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi revealed that Senator Mitch McConnell blocked a plan for Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg from lying in state in the Capitol Rotunda following her death.

In an excerpt from Susan Page’s upcoming book “Madam Speaker,” Speaker Pelosi expresses some tough sentiments about the current Senate minority leader and reveals the debate over the handling of RBG’s memorial. From Punchbowl:

“Mitch McConnell is not a force for good in our country,” Pelosi told me. “He is an enabler of some of the worst stuff, and an instigator of some of it on his own.” The two congressional leaders had never had a particularly good relationship. Now there was bitterness from a new dispute between them, one not reported at the time. When Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died in September, Pelosi proposed that the groundbreaking feminist lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda. She would have been the first woman in history to be so honored. McConnell rejected the idea on the grounds that there was no precedent for such treatment of a justice. When William Howard Taft had lain in state in 1930, he had been not only the chief justice but also president, McConnell noted. He wasn’t swayed by the argument that Ginsburg had achieved an iconic status in American culture, especially for women and girls. McConnell’s refusal meant that Ginsburg’s flag-draped coffin was placed not in the Rotunda, which connects the House and Senate, but in Statuary Hall, on the House side. McConnell and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy didn’t accept invitations to attend the service for her.

Following RBG’s death, McConnell led the effort to rush through the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett in a matter of weeks, shortly before the 2020 presidential election.

Page’s book will be released on April 20.

""There may well be a vote on impeachment on Wednesday,"" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters.

If passed by the Democrat-controlled House, Hoyer said the impeachment article should immediately be sent to the Senate.

Some Democrats have suggested the article be delayed to give the Senate time to first consider President-elect Joe Biden’s nominations and top policy priorities before holding an impeachment trial.

While the article has no Republican co-sponsors, Rep. David Cicilline, one of the authors, said he's hopeful some will vote for it.

“He incited insurrection against the government of the United States that resulted in the death of five individuals, dozens of people injured in violence here at the Capitol,” the Rhode Island Democrat told reporters Monday.

Cicilline said he and other Democrats would prefer that Vice President Mike Pence trigger the 25th Amendment or that Trump resigns on his own.

""Days have passed, and it is clear that neither of those possibilities will be realized,"" Cicilline wrote in an opinion piece in The New York Times published Monday. ""So it is Congress’s responsibility to act.""

Rep. Alex Mooney, R-W.Va., on Monday blocked Democrats from bringing up a resolution to urge Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment and become acting president.

Under House rules, it took only one lawmaker to block immediate consideration of the resolution aimed at pressuring Republicans to take power away from Trump.

Story continues

Mooney had been among the House Republicans who voted last week not to accept the state-certified election results showing Trump lost reelection.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Republican's rejection of the resolution is enabling Trump's ""unhinged, unstable and deranged acts of sedition to continue.""

""Their complicity endangers America, erodes our Democracy, and it must end,"" she said in a statement.

The resolution calls on Pence and the Cabinet to, within 24 hours, ""declare what is obvious to a horrified Nation: That the President is unable to successfully discharge the duties and powers of his office.""

Pence has not shown an interest in triggering the never-used section of the amendment that could strip Trump of his authority.

A slight majority of respondents surveyed after last week's riot by Quinnipiac University said Trump should be removed from office: 52% to 45%. The breakdown was similar for those saying Trump should resign.

Pelosi said Sunday that lawmakers must ""act with urgency"" because Trump is an imminent threat to both the Constitution and democracy.

""As the days go by, the horror of the ongoing assault on our democracy perpetrated by this President is intensified and so is the immediate need for action,"" she wrote in a letter to colleagues.

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., talks with Vice President Mike Pence during the joint session of Congress on Jan. 07, 2021, in Washington.

The impeachment article charges Trump with inciting an insurrection by falsely claiming the Nov. 3 election was stolen from him and encouraging supporters to storm the Capitol as lawmakers were certifying the results.

""President Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of Government,"" the article reads. ""He threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of Government. He therefore betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.""

While a growing number of Republicans have denounced Trump's actions, there is not broad GOP support for impeaching Trump or removing him from office.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Friday it would be better if Democrats and Republicans worked together to facilitate the peaceful transfer of power from Trump to Biden.

That view was echoed Monday by Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer, head of the campaign arm for House Republicans.

In a statement, Emmer said House Democrats’ efforts to remove Trump are politically motivated and “will fracture our nation even more instead of bringing us together.”

For his part, Biden on Friday dodged when asked by reporters whether he supported impeachment. Biden said he would leave that question up to lawmakers.

lbm8zv	liberal	It looks like some Capitol rioters are taking plea deals and agreeing to sell each other out	"Legal experts think some of the people charged in the Capitol riot may be cooperating with federal prosecutors.

The Daily Beast identified several charged with an information rather than a grand jury indictment.

An information charge usually means someone plans to plead guilty, and often indicates cooperation.

Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.

Federal prosecutors are nearly a month into their investigations into people who stormed the Capitol building on January 6, filing charges against more than 200 people so far.

Court records indicate some of those people may be informing the FBI about other participants, according to The Daily Beast.

The Daily Beast identified three people who had been subjected to a charging instrument called an information, rather than a grand jury indictment.

An information is a type of charging instrument prosecutors typically use when the defendant plans to plead guilty.

According to Randy Zelin, a criminal defense attorney at Wilk Auslander LLP and adjunct professor at Cornell Law School, it also typically means the defendant is cooperating with government prosecutors.

""If the government is drawing up an information, and someone is working this out with the government, more often than not, that means that they're cooperating and entered into a cooperation agreement with the government,"" Zelin told Insider.

It's not yet certain if the individuals charged with informations are necessarily cooperating, or have just agreed to plead guilty without a cooperation agreement. Prosecutors don't furnish the full list of witnesses until shortly before the trial begins.

""Generally speaking, cooperative agreements are sealed, because the very essence of a cooperation agreement is that you are cooperating against someone else,"" Zelin said. ""And the government doesn't want that other defendant to know who the cooperators are.""

But prosecutors are sure to seek the cooperation of at least some of the 200-plus people charged. Former Justice Department prosecutor Neama Rahman told The Daily Beast it's unlikely for prosecutors to charge someone with an information unless plea negotiations are underway.

""Cooperation is always likely in federal cases, especially here, where the US Attorney's Office has both significant leverage and wants to identify the ringleaders in this sedition conspiracy, as well as other potential domestic terrorist threats,"" Rahman said. ""It's uncommon to have this large of a gathering of political extremists from all across the country, so the government will have a treasure trove of information and witnesses to work with.""

Justice Department representatives didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

One of the people charged with an information is Matthew Mazzocco, who was arrested at his home in Texas on January 17 after posting videos of his involvement online. According to court records reviewed by Insider, Mazzocco was first charged with a criminal complaint. On Thursday, he was charged with an information on similar counts, a day before he was ordered to appear in court later this week.

Zelin said that once pleas are formalized, we could have a better understanding of who may be cooperating with prosecutors. People who cooperate are likely to receive lesser charges than those who don't, he said.

""That would give you a little bit more insight as to whether or not someone is actually cooperating,"" he said. ""Because the better the deal is, the more likely it is that what they've given up in return for getting that better deal is cooperating."""	left
gzm2fc	liberal	PAC founded by Colin Kaepernick’s attorney releases scathing video against Ivanka Trump using her dropped commencement speech	"A new political action committee, which was founded by Colin Kaepernick's attorney, has released a scathing ad against Ivanka Trump.

In the video, the committee compiled Ms Trump's commencement speech she prepared for Wichita State University with statements from Donald Trump, and news footage of police brutality against protesters.

Ms Trump was initially supposed to give the commencement speech to the 2020 graduates, but the Kansas school dropped her speech following a backlash from students.

In response, the president's daughter shared her video on Twitter.

""Our nation's campuses should be bastions of free speech. Cancel culture and viewpoint discrimination are antithetical to academia,"" she wrote. ""Listening to one another is important now more than ever!

In the speech, Ms Trump stood in front of a blue screen with an American flag positioned behind her.

""Your journey to this day did not come without challenges, sacrifices, grit, sweat, and likely even a few tears,"" she said to the camera.

The scene then alters in PAC's video, titled ""Bye Ivanka"", to show police firing tear gas on what looks to be peaceful protesters who took to the streets following the death of George Floyd two weeks ago.

Her speech continued with the first daughter saying: ""Our entire society is engaged in a national endeavour to take care of the safety and well-being of our people.""

As she speaks, images come on the screen showing police hitting protesters with batons and shoving an elderly man to the ground, a moment that happened in Buffalo, New York.

Her father also makes an appearance from his Rose Garden address last week where he implored law enforcement to ""dominate the streets"" to control the protests.

The video was produced by Meidas Touch, a progressive PAC founded in April by attorney Ben Meiselas and his two brothers. Mr Meiselas was the lead attorney for Mr Kaepernick when he settled with the National Football League (NFL) last year.

Since its creation, the PAC has released several pro-Democratic videos. The one targeting Ms Trump was the committee's latest release.

The hashtag #ByeIvanka later trended on Twitter following the release of the PAC's video. Ms Ivanka has not commented on the new ad."	left
m7rqox	liberal	Dad of child with Down’s syndrome confronts Marjorie Taylor Greene over disabled slur, she is a disgusting pathetic human, Republicans are you proud.	"A father to a 10-year-old boy with Down’s syndrome confronted congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene over past comments she made about the condition, and many deemed to be offensive, at a GOP meeting on Tuesday.

Shaun Holmes, a Whitfield County Republican, reportedly addressed Ms Greene about comments she made about Down’s syndrome, and said he decided to speak-up on Tuesday because his son can’t, WTVC NewsChannel 9 reported.

Ms Greene, who represents Georgia's 14th congressional district, was recently condemned after she described people with Down’s syndrome as “retards” who were “so stupid”, in a video shared on social media. It was recorded and uploaded before she was elected to Congress in November.

""I'm sorry, I know that's an offensive word, and I'm not trying to talk down on people with Down syndrome — but that's what these people are."" Ms Greene added in the video.

Mr Holmes, who was not aware Ms Greene would be attending the weekly meeting of the Whitfield County Republican Party, confronted the congresswoman in front of other GOP officials — some of whom said they supported the congresswoman, according to NewsChannel 9.

“He’s my buddy, he's, you know, has changed me a lot”, said Mr Holmes, who demanded Ms Greene respond to criticism about the video calling Down’s syndrome people “stupid”.

""I just want a response from you,” said Mr Holmes. “To call people retarded and then say no offence to people with Down syndrome. I mean that's bull****,” he added.

Ms Greene responded, and said she was ""just being a regular person, a lot of times I use slang word[s] and using that term,"" before Mr Holmes interrupted her, saying: ""No, no, that is not acceptable.""

“I guess it was a slang word. You can actually look it up in the dictionary,” continued Ms Greene. “There is a definition that means ‘stupid.’ But it’s not about people with Down’s Syndrome... I do apologise for that being offensive to anyone.”

Mr Holmes told NewsChannel9 afterwards that Ms Greene owed his son and people with Down’s syndrome an apology, and that ""Right now, I mean, she doesn't represent my son or my family”.

Another parent and the chairman of the neighbouring Gordon County Republican Party, Kathleen Thorman, added to NewsChannel 9 that the congresswoman had been compassionate with her own daughter, who also has Down’s syndrome.

“She’s always been very compassionate and kind,” said Ms Thorman. “I think the gentlemen last night never had the opportunity to see what I saw. And like I said, it’s more about what people do, rather than what people say.”

Ms Greene, meanwhile, provided NewsChannel9 with a list of 15 pieces of legislation she has co-sponsored since being elected to Congress, which included an impeachment article against US president Joe Biden, and a law protecting unborn children with Down’s syndrome from abortion.

Members of the House last week overwhelmingly voted to remove Ms Greene of her committee assignments, following a number of other controversies and previous support for online conspiracies, including QAnon.

This article was amended on February 17, 2021, to change a reference to ‘Down’s syndrome sufferers’ to ‘people with Down’s syndrome’."	left
hl1zff	liberal	Kellyanne Conway's anti-Trump teen daughter claims she's being silenced	"Kellyanne Conway’s anti-Trump teen daughter claims she’s being silenced

Claudia Conway made headlines this week after she shared her pro-BLM political views through a series of TikTok videos.

via screengrab (YouTube/TikTok)

White House adviser Kellyanne Conway had an awkward moment on TikTok with her teen daughter over freedom of speech.

Claudia Conway, 15, made headlines this week after she shared her political views with the world through a series of TikTok videos, Complex reports.

While her mother is very much pro-Trump, and her father is anti-Trump conservative, George Conway, the high schooler is a liberal activist and supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement.

The Conways, understandably, are not pleased with the media attention that their teen daughter is getting over her stance on certain social issues. The minor and her mother recently sparred on TikTok, with Kellyanne demanding that she end the stream but Claudia refuses.

“You’re literally not letting me use my freedom of speech,” she tells her mom, who appears to keep calm as she insists Claudia “shut it all down,” because “not everyone’s following is well-meaning.”

Watch the moment go down via the YouTube clip below:

George, meanwhile, has demanded all journalists cease communication with the minor.

Taking to Twitter on Friday (July 3), he wrote, “ “To journalists: @kellyannepolls and I do *not* consent to any communications between you and any of our minor children, including our daughter Claudia. So desist.”

The teen claims her parents are trying to silence her by shutting off her phone and pressuring her to delete her social media accounts.

“Please stop supporting my dad because he’s trying to take down my social media accounts too,” she said during the live stream with her famous mother.

To journalists: @kellyannepolls and I do *not* consent to any communications between you and any of our minor children, including our daughter Claudia. So desist. Thank you. — George Conway (@gtconway3d) July 3, 2020

Claudia claims she has “been bullied and badgered her entire life because of her parents,” so she’s now using her platform to speak her truth.

“I grew up in a very, very conservative family, so I was only exposed to those views for a very long time. I decided to educate myself and think for myself,” Claudia told Insider

“I’m still a kid, of course. I took the time to educate myself and took the time to branch out and be exposed to other sides and other biases and whatnot. We do get into arguments a lot — I’m not going to lie.”

i45dxs	liberal	Biden campaign to hammer Trump over pandemic response with $280 million in ads across 15 states	"(CNN) Joe Biden's campaign says it has reserved $280 million in television and digital advertising that it plans to use largely to hammer President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

The presumptive Democratic nominee's ads will often run 60 seconds rather than the more typical 30-second commercials, and will frequently feature Biden speaking directly into a camera, campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon said in a memo Wednesday. The ads will air in 15 states the campaign believes will be competitive in November's election.

The ads will focus heavily on the pandemic, contrasting what Biden's campaign sees as Trump's failures with the former vice president's experience and empathy. Biden's ads are intended to allow voters to ""hear directly from the vice president in his own voice, speaking to this moment that we're in,"" O'Malley Dillon told reporters in a call detailing the strategy.

The reservations, which include $220 million for television and $60 million in digital ads, underscore Biden aides' belief that this year's election offers Democrats a wide playing field, with a large number of possible paths for Biden to reach 270 electoral votes.

l5tpsb	liberal	GOP demands right to filibuster after taking it away from Democrats in 2017	"They did not believe the 60-vote threshold was essential when it applied to Trump's Supreme Court nominees.

Senate Republicans are mounting an aggressive campaign to keep their power to block nearly all of the new Democratic majority's legislative proposals.

But while they now defend the Senate's filibuster rule as vital for ""bipartisanship,"" they unanimously voted to eliminate it for Supreme Court nominations less than four years ago.

While it only takes a simple majority in the 100-member U.S. Senate to pass legislation, with few exceptions it takes a three-fifths supermajority — 60 votes — to end debate and actually hold a vote. Segregationists long used those cloture rules to block civil rights legislation and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell used them a record-breaking number of times to obstruct President Barack Obama's agenda.

Senate rules would allow just 51 senators to change that 60-vote threshold. After Democrats retook a narrow majority in the chamber on Wednesday, McConnell (R-KY) and his colleagues began demanding Democrats agree in advance not to do so.

Much of their argument has centered on the importance of preserving the super-majority requirement as a way to ensure bipartisan decisions.

But back in April 2017, the 60-vote requirement also applied to Supreme Court nominations. When Donald Trump nominated conservative Neil Gorsuch to the high court, he lacked the needed supermajority to be confirmed.

Rather than find a nominee palatable to a large bipartisan majority, McConnell and every Republican senator voted to change the rules to eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees. They then confirmed him on a mostly party-line vote for a lifetime appointment.

That has not stopped many of those same Republican senators from taking the opposite view now.

McConnell is currently blocking an organizing resolution that would allow Senate committees to operate, demanding that he keep his power to block bills.

""Leader McConnell expressed his long-held view that the crucial, longstanding and bipartisan Senate rules concerning the legislative filibuster remain intact, specifically during the power share for the next two years,"" his spokesman told the Associated Press on Tuesday.

""The 60 vote cloture requirement (filibuster rule) requires bipartisanship and provides stability in our laws- something we should all want in a big, diverse country of 330 million people,"" Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) tweeted on Friday.

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) agreed, tweeting on Friday, ""Senate GOP majority fended off calls to end legislative filibuster incl from Pres Trump We didn’t cave 2pressure 2go 'nuclear' on legis filibuster bc we knew weight of keeping Senate the gr8 deliberative body Framers of Constitution intended Its time for Senate Democrats 2do same.""

On Thursday, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) tweeted a years-old quote from Biden explaining the rationale for the filibuster rule, opining, ""Makes sense to me!""

According to a Politico report on Thursday, Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) backed McConnell's efforts to force Democrats to keep the rule, saying, ""You want to do it before there's an emotional, difficult, controversial issue. So that it isn’t issue-driven, it's institution-driven.""

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told the outlet that his party needs Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to say ""we're not going to change the legislative filibuster.""

Sens. McConnell, Cornyn, Grassley, Rubio, Collins, and Graham all voted for the 2017 rule change.

l1rq5q	liberal	Michael Moore On Exiting Donald Trump: “We Are Not Done With Him … He Must Pay For His Actions”	"National Review

The state of Texas is considering a “constitutional carry” law, which would do away with the requirement that Texans get a permit before carrying a firearm. Under constitutional carry, so-called, if you are eligible to purchase a firearm, then you are eligible to carry one. I am of two minds about this. I am a Second Amendment advocate, and I would prefer that both Congress and the courts recognize, as plainly as possible, that the right to keep and bear arms mentioned in the Constitution has nothing to do with hunting or recreational shooting — there are no hobbies in the Bill of Rights. The Second Amendment protects the rights of Americans to keep and bear war-fighting arms, one of the rights that traditionally distinguishes citizens from subjects. That makes regulation a dicey matter, because the classes of firearms anti-gun activists want to prohibit are the ones the Second Amendment exists to protect — including the AR-15 and semiautomatic handguns, not just granddad’s deer rifle. (Although dear ol’ pawpaw’s deer rifle was a “weapon of war” in its day, too: The classic .30-06 hunting round was developed for the U.S. military and adopted by the army in 1906, hence the designation — .30 caliber, ’06 model.) When the gun-grabbers complain that thus and such a firearm was designed for the primary purpose of killing people, the answer is, “Well, yes — that’s precisely the point.” Anti-gun types like to mock that, painting Second Amendment activists as a bunch of fantasists who are Rambo in their dreams and Babbitt in their waking hours. That is . . . not entirely unfair, at least not in all cases. It is true that gun-owning Americans are unlikely ever to use their firearms to defend their families from criminals, much less use them to battle tyranny. But it also is true that 99.44 percent of Americans will never have an interesting or original thought or write a sentence that is worth reading once, much less a sentence that is worth remembering, and we keep the First Amendment around all the same. There’s a good reason for that; it’s not just sentimentality. Unlike some of my legal-minded friends and colleagues, I think the doctrine of “incorporation” — applying federal constitutional restrictions to the states — is a little bit sketchy. The First Amendment says, “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof”; it says nothing about the state legislature of New Jersey. That doesn’t mean that our civil rights can be legitimately taken away by the states — it means that state constitutions need their own charters of rights, which, of course, most of them have. The Texas bill of rights, for example, contains two separate provisions regarding religion (one securing freedom of worship, the other prohibiting “appropriations for sectarian purposes”), a free-speech guarantee, rules about searches and bail, etc. It also recognizes a right to keep and bear arms, one that is in some ways clearer than the one recognized by the Second Amendment: “Every citizen shall have the right to keep and bear arms in the lawful defense of himself or the State; but the Legislature shall have power, by law, to regulate the wearing of arms, with a view to prevent crime.” Of course, the fact that the legislature may regulate the wearing of arms does not mean that it must, but it seems to me that there is some tension between the notion that unpermitted carry is a constitutional mandate and the Texas constitution’s reservation of regulatory discretion to the state. My own inclination is to treat the Second Amendment as though it means just what it says as a federal matter, while being a good federalist and making room for considerable variation in regulation at the state level. I have lived in the South Bronx, and I have lived in a remote corner of Colorado with an elk-to-biped ratio of 24:1 — and I do not think that both places need to maintain precisely the same firearms laws. It is both constitutionally sound and prudent to maintain a good deal of local diversity, including within the states: Houston and Terlingua are not very much alike. I’d love to sign off without reservation on constitutional carry, because I believe the right recognized (not granted) by the Second Amendment is an important one. “We win, you lose!” is always a satisfying outcome — but, sometimes, it is the wrong outcome. We love our guns in Texas. Last week, I went to a sporting-goods store outside Dallas that had a hand-lettered sign taped to the door informing irritated shoppers that the day’s ammunition delivery had not arrived; inside, the ammo section was indeed picked bare with the exception of a few boxes of odd-duck calibers. (If you happened to be looking to load a rifle chambered for the 6.5×55mm Swedish cartridge, you were in luck — Dallas-area moose beware.) It has been that way for more than a year, since the onset of the coronavirus epidemic. And we aren’t hoarding all that ammo, either: Getting a lane at a popular shooting range is harder than getting a table at Dorsia. A parishioner at my church observes that the guards who work the doors on Sundays probably are superfluous and that any would-be troublemaker entering the church would be likely to encounter the Almighty sooner rather than later. I am a conservative, and so I support Americans’ right to keep and bear arms. But I also do not live under a rock, and so I know that most Americans cannot be trusted to safely operate a mobile phone without endangering the lives of other people, e.g., by scrolling through Instagram while driving 82 m.p.h. down the George Bush Turnpike in a Lexus ES-350. It is true that the states that have passed constitutional carry — and those such as Vermont that simply never bothered to enact gun laws in the first place — have not seen elevated levels of firearms-related crime or accidents. But I am not persuaded that “studies say” should be the end of the argument, and I don’t think that sitting through a class on safe gun-handling, putting ten rounds into the circle at a reasonable distance, and passing a background check every couple of years would constitute an unreasonable burden on this civil right. In fact, the last time I sat through a concealed-carry class, there were a couple of people in attendance who clearly should not be carrying a firearm in public — one was trying to shove .45 ACP rounds into a 9mm pistol and asked a lot of questions about the circumstances under which it is permissible to shoot a police officer, something the police officer teaching the class took note of. (To be fair, this was in Dallas, where the police sometimes break into your house and shoot you for no reason at all.) Licensure has the advantage of providing us with a formal opportunity to inform those ineligible to carry in no uncertain terms that they may not legally carry a firearm, whereas under an unlicensed-carry regime someone illegally carrying a gun might plausibly plead ignorance to his ineligibility in many circumstances. For all of our cowboy pretense, Texas is not very much like Wyoming — it is a big state full of big cities with big-city problems. Introducing the unlicensed carrying of firearms into Dallas or Houston does not seem to me an obviously desirable aim — Texas already has a perfectly workable permitting system, and abolishing it is a textbook example of a solution in search of a problem."	left
h8rz36	liberal	POLL Most Americans Say Trump Racist & Below Average/Failure	"A stunning new poll finds that significant majorities believe President Donald Trump as racist, and rate him as “below average” or a “failure” as President.

Trump has gotten a lot of bad polling news recently, as his approval ratings have cratered and his general election opponent Joe Biden has widened his lead over the incumbent. A new Yahoo! News/YouGov poll is arguably worse news for Trump, as the results cut at his character and place in American history.

When directly asked “Do you think that President Trump is a racist?”, 52 percent said yes, while only 34 percent said no — an 18 point spread. Even a hefty plurality of white voters agreed Trump is a racist, 46-39, while only 14 percent of Republicans said yes to the question. Crucially, among independent voters, the spread was even wider than the overall number, with 53 percent saying Trump is a racist and only 31 percent saying he is not.

Respondents were also asked “How would you rate the following Presidents?”, and given choices ranging from “Great” to “failure” in assessing Trump and former Presidents Barack Obama, Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, John F. Kennedy, Dwight Eisenhower, and Franklin Roosevelt.

It did not go well for Trump. A whopping 54 percent rated Trump either a “failure” or “below average,” with the results overwhelmingly tilted to “failure” at 43 percent. That’s more than double the number who said the same of President Obama, whose polarizing presidency scored 21 percent in that metric. That’s versus 45 percent who said Obama was “great” or “near great.”

In fact, Trump was seen as a failure by more than triple the number of people who said the same of President Bush (13%) and President Carter (12%). As for President Lincoln, to whom Trump has frequently compared himself, only 2 percent of Americans rated him a failure.

Overall, Biden led Trump by nine points in the poll, 49 percent to 40 percent.

Significant pluralities in the poll also said that former Vice President Joe Biden would do a better job handling a raft of issues: Protests, Coronavirus pandemic, Race relations, Immigration, and Foreign policy.

Trump did retain a 3-point advantage over Biden on the economy, 37 percent to 34 percent, but with 29 percent saying they didn’t know or that Biden and Trump would handle it “about the same.”

On the bright side of things, at least Trump doesn’t have to worry about running against Abe Lincoln.

j0zgfm	liberal	Long-Concealed Records Show Trump's Chronic Losses and Years of Tax Avoidance; The Times obtained Donald Trump’s tax information extending over more than two decades, revealing struggling properties, vast write-offs, an audit battle and hundreds of millions in debt coming due.	"The Times obtained Donald Trump’s tax information extending over more than two decades, revealing struggling properties, vast write-offs, an audit battle and hundreds of millions in debt coming due.

Donald J. Trump paid $750 in federal income taxes the year he won the presidency. In his first year in the White House, he paid another $750.

He had paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years — largely because he reported losing much more money than he made.

As the president wages a re-election campaign that polls say he is in danger of losing, his finances are under stress, beset by losses and hundreds of millions of dollars in debt coming due that he has personally guaranteed. Also hanging over him is a decade-long audit battle with the Internal Revenue Service over the legitimacy of a $72.9 million tax refund that he claimed, and received, after declaring huge losses. An adverse ruling could cost him more than $100 million.

The tax returns that Mr. Trump has long fought to keep private tell a story fundamentally different from the one he has sold to the American public. His reports to the I.R.S. portray a businessman who takes in hundreds of millions of dollars a year yet racks up chronic losses that he aggressively employs to avoid paying taxes. Now, with his financial challenges mounting, the records show that he depends more and more on making money from businesses that put him in potential and often direct conflict of interest with his job as president.

The New York Times has obtained tax-return data extending over more than two decades for Mr. Trump and the hundreds of companies that make up his business organization, including detailed information from his first two years in office. It does not include his personal returns for 2018 or 2019. This article offers an overview of The Times’s findings; additional articles will be published in the coming weeks.

The returns are some of the most sought-after, and speculated-about, records in recent memory. In Mr. Trump’s nearly four years in office — and across his endlessly hyped decades in the public eye — journalists, prosecutors, opposition politicians and conspiracists have, with limited success, sought to excavate the enigmas of his finances. By their very nature, the filings will leave many questions unanswered, many questioners unfulfilled. They comprise information that Mr. Trump has disclosed to the I.R.S., not the findings of an independent financial examination. They report that Mr. Trump owns hundreds of millions of dollars in valuable assets, but they do not reveal his true wealth. Nor do they reveal any previously unreported connections to Russia.

In response to a letter summarizing The Times’s findings, Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said that “most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate” and requested the documents on which they were based. After The Times declined to provide the records, in order to protect its sources, Mr. Garten took direct issue only with the amount of taxes Mr. Trump had paid.

“Over the past decade, President Trump has paid tens of millions of dollars in personal taxes to the federal government, including paying millions in personal taxes since announcing his candidacy in 2015,” Mr. Garten said in a statement.

With the term “personal taxes,” however, Mr. Garten appears to be conflating income taxes with other federal taxes Mr. Trump has paid — Social Security, Medicare and taxes for his household employees. Mr. Garten also asserted that some of what the president owed was “paid with tax credits,” a misleading characterization of credits, which reduce a business owner’s income-tax bill as a reward for various activities, like historic preservation.

The tax data examined by The Times provides a road map of revelations, from write-offs for the cost of a criminal defense lawyer and a mansion used as a family retreat to a full accounting of the millions of dollars the president received from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow.

Together with related financial documents and legal filings, the records offer the most detailed look yet inside the president’s business empire. They reveal the hollowness, but also the wizardry, behind the self-made-billionaire image — honed through his star turn on “The Apprentice” — that helped propel him to the White House and that still undergirds the loyalty of many in his base.

Ultimately, Mr. Trump has been more successful playing a business mogul than being one in real life.

“The Apprentice,” along with the licensing and endorsement deals that flowed from his expanding celebrity, brought Mr. Trump a total of $427.4 million, The Times’s analysis of the records found. He invested much of that in a collection of businesses, mostly golf courses, that in the years since have steadily devoured cash — much as the money he secretly received from his father financed a spree of quixotic overspending that led to his collapse in the early 1990s.

Indeed, his financial condition when he announced his run for president in 2015 lends some credence to the notion that his long-shot campaign was at least in part a gambit to reanimate the marketability of his name.

As the legal and political battles over access to his tax returns have intensified, Mr. Trump has often wondered aloud why anyone would even want to see them. “There’s nothing to learn from them,” he told The Associated Press in 2016. There is far more useful information, he has said, in the annual financial disclosures required of him as president — which he has pointed to as evidence of his mastery of a flourishing, and immensely profitable, business universe.

In fact, those public filings offer a distorted picture of his financial state, since they simply report revenue, not profit. In 2018, for example, Mr. Trump announced in his disclosure that he had made at least $434.9 million. The tax records deliver a very different portrait of his bottom line: $47.4 million in losses.

Tax records do not have the specificity to evaluate the legitimacy of every business expense Mr. Trump claims to reduce his taxable income — for instance, without any explanation in his returns, the general and administrative expenses at his Bedminster golf club in New Jersey increased fivefold from 2016 to 2017. And he has previously bragged that his ability to get by without paying taxes “makes me smart,” as he said in 2016. But the returns, by his own account, undercut his claims of financial acumen, showing that he is simply pouring more money into many businesses than he is taking out.

The picture that perhaps emerges most starkly from the mountain of figures and tax schedules prepared by Mr. Trump’s accountants is of a businessman-president in a tightening financial vise.

Most of Mr. Trump’s core enterprises — from his constellation of golf courses to his conservative-magnet hotel in Washington — report losing millions, if not tens of millions, of dollars year after year.

His revenue from “The Apprentice” and from licensing deals is drying up, and several years ago he sold nearly all the stocks that now might have helped him plug holes in his struggling properties.

The tax audit looms.

And within the next four years, more than $300 million in loans — obligations for which he is personally responsible — will come due.

Against that backdrop, the records go much further toward revealing the actual and potential conflicts of interest created by Mr. Trump’s refusal to divest himself of his business interests while in the White House. His properties have become bazaars for collecting money directly from lobbyists, foreign officials and others seeking face time, access or favor; the records for the first time put precise dollar figures on those transactions.

At the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla., a flood of new members starting in 2015 allowed him to pocket an additional $5 million a year from the business. In 2017, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association paid at least $397,602 to the Washington hotel, where the group held at least one event during its four-day World Summit in Defense of Persecuted Christians.

The Times was also able to take the fullest measure to date of the president’s income from overseas, where he holds ultimate sway over American diplomacy. When he took office, Mr. Trump said he would pursue no new foreign deals as president. Even so, in his first two years in the White House, his revenue from abroad totaled $73 million. And while much of that money was from his golf properties in Scotland and Ireland, some came from licensing deals in countries with authoritarian-leaning leaders or thorny geopolitics — for example, $3 million from the Philippines, $2.3 million from India and $1 million from Turkey.

He reported paying taxes, in turn, on a number of his overseas ventures. In 2017, the president’s $750 contribution to the operations of the U.S. government was dwarfed by the $15,598 he or his companies paid in Panama, the $145,400 in India and the $156,824 in the Philippines.

The $750 Tax Bill Here’s how his accountants arrived at that figure in 2017.

Mr. Trump’s U.S. payment, after factoring in his losses, was roughly equivalent, in dollars not adjusted for inflation, to another presidential tax bill revealed nearly a half-century before. In 1973, The Providence Journal reported that, after a charitable deduction for donating his presidential papers, Richard M. Nixon had paid $792.81 in 1970 on income of about $200,000.

The leak of Mr. Nixon’s small tax payment caused a precedent-setting uproar: Henceforth, presidents, and presidential candidates, would make their tax returns available for the American people to see.

A Map of the Empire

The contents of thousands of personal and business tax records fill in financial details that have been withheld for years.

“I would love to do that,” Mr. Trump said in 2014 when asked whether he would release his taxes if he ran for president. He’s been backpedaling ever since.

When he ran, he said he might make his taxes public if Hillary Clinton did the same with the deleted emails from her private server — an echo of his taunt, while stoking the birther fiction, that he might release the returns if President Barack Obama released his birth certificate. He once boasted that his tax returns were “very big” and “beautiful.” But making them public? “It’s very complicated.” He often claims that he cannot do so while under audit — an argument refuted by his own I.R.S. commissioner. When prosecutors and congressional investigators issued subpoenas for his returns, he wielded not just his private lawyers but also the power of his Justice Department to stalemate them all the way to the Supreme Court.

Mr. Trump’s elaborate dance and defiance have only stoked suspicion about what secrets might lie hidden in his taxes. Is there a financial clue to his deference to Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin? Did he write off as a business expense the hush-money payment to the pornographic film star Stormy Daniels in the days before the 2016 election? Did a covert source of money feed his frenzy of acquisition that began in the mid-2000s?

The Times examined and analyzed the data from thousands of individual and business tax returns for 2000 through 2017, along with additional tax information from other years. The trove included years of employee compensation information and records of cash payments between the president and his businesses, as well as information about ongoing federal audits of his taxes. This article also draws upon dozens of interviews and previously unreported material from other sources, both public and confidential.

All of the information The Times obtained was provided by sources with legal access to it. While most of the tax data has not previously been made public, The Times was able to verify portions of it by comparing it with publicly available information and confidential records previously obtained by The Times.

To delve into the records is to see up close the complex structure of the president’s business interests — and the depth of his entanglements. What is popularly known as the Trump Organization is in fact a collection of more than 500 entities, virtually all of them wholly owned by Mr. Trump, many carrying his name. For example, 105 of them are a variation of the name Trump Marks, which he uses for licensing deals.

Fragments of Mr. Trump’s tax returns have leaked out before.

Transcripts of his main federal tax form, the 1040, from 1985 to 1994, were obtained by The Times in 2019. They showed that, in many years, Mr. Trump lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer. Three pages of his 1995 returns, mailed anonymously to The Times during the 2016 campaign, showed that Mr. Trump had declared losses of $915.7 million, giving him a tax deduction that could have allowed him to avoid federal income taxes for almost two decades. Five months later, the journalist David Cay Johnston obtained two pages of Mr. Trump’s returns from 2005; that year, his fortunes had rebounded to the point that he was paying taxes.

In 1995, the year Mr. Trump broke ground on the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York, he would declare losses of $915.7 million — a sum so large, it could be carried forward to cancel out taxable income for years.

The vast new trove of information analyzed by The Times completes the recurring pattern of ascent and decline that has defined the president’s career. Even so, it has its limits.

Tax returns do not, for example, record net worth — in Mr. Trump’s case, a topic of much posturing and almost as much debate. The documents chart a great churn of money, but while returns report debts, they often do not identify lenders.

The data contains no new revelations about the $130,000 payment to Stephanie Clifford, the actress who performs as Stormy Daniels — a focus of the Manhattan district attorney’s subpoena for Mr. Trump’s tax returns and other financial information. Mr. Trump has acknowledged reimbursing his former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, who made the payoff, but the materials obtained by The Times did not include any itemized payments to Mr. Cohen. The amount, however, could have been improperly included in legal fees written off as a business expense, which are not required to be itemized on tax returns.

No subject has provoked more intense speculation about Mr. Trump’s finances than his connection to Russia. While the tax records revealed no previously unknown financial connection — and, for the most part, lack the specificity required to do so — they did shed new light on the money behind the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, a subject of enduring intrigue because of subsequent investigations into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.

The records show that the pageant was the most profitable Miss Universe during Mr. Trump’s time as co-owner, and that it generated a personal payday of $2.3 million — made possible, at least in part, by the Agalarov family, who would later help set up the infamous 2016 meeting between Trump campaign officials seeking “dirt” on Mrs. Clinton and a Russian lawyer connected to the Kremlin.

In August, the Senate Intelligence Committee released a report that looked extensively into the circumstances of the Moscow pageant, and revealed that as recently as February, investigators subpoenaed the Russian singer Emin Agalarov, who was involved in planning it. Mr. Agalarov’s father, Aras, a billionaire who boasts of close ties to Mr. Putin, was Mr. Trump’s partner in the event.

The committee interviewed a top Miss Universe executive, Paula Shugart, who said the Agalarovs offered to underwrite the event; their family business, Crocus Group, paid a $6 million licensing fee and another $6 million in expenses. But while the pageant proved to be a financial loss for the Agalarovs — they recouped only $2 million — Ms. Shugart told investigators that it was “one of the most lucrative deals” the Miss Universe organization ever made, according to the report.

That is borne out by the tax records. They show that in 2013, the pageant reported $31.6 million in gross receipts — the highest since at least the 1990s — allowing Mr. Trump and his co-owner, NBC, to split profits of $4.7 million. By comparison, Mr. Trump and NBC shared losses of $2 million from the pageant the year before the Moscow event, and $3.8 million from the one the year after.

Loser, Winner

Losses reported by businesses Mr. Trump owns and runs helped wipe out tax bills on hundreds of millions of dollars in celebrity income.

While Mr. Trump crisscrossed the country in 2015 describing himself as uniquely qualified to be president because he was “really rich” and had “built a great company,” his accountants back in New York were busy putting the finishing touches on his 2014 tax return.

After tabulating all the profits and losses from Mr. Trump’s various endeavors on Form 1040, the accountants came to Line 56, where they had to enter the total income tax the candidate was required to pay. They needed space for only a single figure.

Zero.

For Mr. Trump, that bottom line must have looked familiar. It was the fourth year in a row that he had not paid a penny of federal income taxes.

Mr. Trump’s avoidance of income taxes is one of the most striking discoveries in his tax returns, especially given the vast wash of income itemized elsewhere in those filings.

Mr. Trump’s net income from his fame — his 50 percent share of “The Apprentice,” together with the riches showered upon him by the scores of suitors paying to use his name — totaled $427.4 million through 2018. A further $176.5 million in profit came to him through his investment in two highly successful office buildings.

So how did he escape nearly all taxes on that fortune? Even the effective tax rate paid by the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans could have caused him to pay more than $100 million.

The answer rests in a third category of Mr. Trump’s endeavors: businesses that he owns and runs himself. The collective and persistent losses he reported from them largely absolved him from paying federal income taxes on the $600 million from “The Apprentice,” branding deals and investments.

That equation is a key element of the alchemy of Mr. Trump’s finances: using the proceeds of his celebrity to purchase and prop up risky businesses, then wielding their losses to avoid taxes.

Throughout his career, Mr. Trump’s business losses have often accumulated in sums larger than could be used to reduce taxes on other income in a single year. But the tax code offers a workaround: With some restrictions, business owners can carry forward leftover losses to reduce taxes in future years.

That provision has been the background music to Mr. Trump’s life. As The Times’s previous reporting on his 1995 return showed, the nearly $1 billion in losses from his early-1990s collapse generated a tax deduction that he could use for up to 18 years going forward.

The newer tax returns show that Mr. Trump burned through the last of the tax-reducing power of that $1 billion in 2005, just as a torrent of entertainment riches began coming his way following the debut of “The Apprentice” the year before.

For 2005 through 2007, cash from licensing deals and endorsements filled Mr. Trump’s bank accounts with $120 million in pure profit. With no prior-year losses left to reduce his taxable income, he paid substantial federal income taxes for the first time in his life: a total of $70.1 million.

As his celebrity income swelled, Mr. Trump went on a buying spree unlike any he had had since the 1980s, when eager banks and his father’s wealth allowed him to buy or build the casinos, airplanes, yacht and old hotel that would soon lay him low.

When “The Apprentice” premiered, Mr. Trump had opened only two golf courses and was renovating two more. By the end of 2015, he had 15 courses and was transforming the Old Post Office building in Washington into a Trump International Hotel. But rather than making him wealthier, the tax records reveal as never before, each new acquisition only fed the downward draft on his bottom line.

Consider the results at his largest golf resort, Trump National Doral, near Miami. Mr. Trump bought the resort for $150 million in 2012; through 2018, his losses have totaled $162.3 million. He has pumped $213 million of fresh cash into Doral, tax records show, and has a $125 million mortgage balance coming due in three years.

His three courses in Europe — two in Scotland and one in Ireland — have reported a combined $63.6 million in losses.

Over all, since 2000, Mr. Trump has reported losses of $315.6 million at the golf courses that are his prized possessions.

For all of its Trumpworld allure, his Washington hotel, opened in 2016, has not fared much better. Its tax records show losses through 2018 of $55.5 million.

And Trump Corporation, a real estate services company, has reported losing $134 million since 2000. Mr. Trump personally bankrolled the losses year after year, marking his cash infusions as a loan with an ever-increasing balance, his tax records show. In 2016, he gave up on getting paid back and turned the loan into a cash contribution.

Mr. Trump has often posited that his losses are more accounting magic than actual money out the door.

Last year, after The Times published details of his tax returns from the 1980s and 1990s, he attributed the red ink to depreciation, which he said in a tweet would show “losses in almost all cases” and that “much was non monetary.”

“I love depreciation,” Mr. Trump said during a presidential debate in 2016.

Depreciation, though, is not a magic wand — it involves real money spent or borrowed to buy buildings or other assets that are expected to last years. Those costs must be spread out as expenses and deducted over the useful life of the asset. Even so, the rules do hold particular advantages for real estate developers like Mr. Trump, who are allowed to use their real estate losses to reduce their taxable income from other activities.

What the tax records for Mr. Trump’s businesses show, however, is that he has lost chunks of his fortune even before depreciation is figured in. The three European golf courses, the Washington hotel, Doral and Trump Corporation reported losing a total of $150.3 million from 2010 through 2018, without including depreciation as an expense.

To see what a successful business looks like, depreciation or not, look no further than one in Mr. Trump’s portfolio that he does not manage.

After plans for a Trump-branded mini-city on the Far West Side of Manhattan stalled in the 1990s, Mr. Trump’s stake was sold by his partner to Vornado Realty Trust. Mr. Trump objected to the sale in court, saying he had not been consulted, but he ended up with a 30 percent share of two valuable office buildings owned and operated by Vornado.

His share of the profits through the end of 2018 totaled $176.5 million, with depreciation factored in. He has never had to invest more money in the partnership, tax records show.

Among businesses he runs, Mr. Trump’s first success remains his best. The retail and commercial spaces at Trump Tower, completed in 1983, have reliably delivered more than $20 million a year in profits, a total of $336.3 million since 2000 that has done much to help keep him afloat.

Mr. Trump has an established track record of stiffing his lenders. But the tax returns reveal that he has failed to pay back far more money than previously known: a total of $287 million since 2010.

The I.R.S. considers forgiven debt to be income, but Mr. Trump was able to avoid taxes on much of that money by reducing his ability to declare future business losses. For the rest, he took advantage of a provision of the Great Recession bailout that allowed income from canceled debt to be completely deferred for five years, then spread out evenly over the next five. He declared the first $28.2 million in 2014.

Once again, his business losses mostly absolved his tax responsibilities. He paid no federal income taxes for 2014.

Mr. Trump was periodically required to pay a parallel income tax called the alternative minimum tax, created as a tripwire to prevent wealthy people from using huge deductions, including business losses, to entirely wipe out their tax liabilities.

Mr. Trump paid alternative minimum tax in seven years between 2000 and 2017 — a total of $24.3 million, excluding refunds he received after filing. For 2015, he paid $641,931, his first payment of any federal income tax since 2010.

As he settled into the Oval Office, his tax bills soon returned to form. His potential taxable income in 2016 and 2017 included $24.8 million in profits from sources related to his celebrity status and $56.4 million for the loans he did not repay. The dreaded alternative minimum tax would let his business losses erase only some of his liability.

Each time, he requested an extension to file his 1040; and each time, he made the required payment to the I.R.S. for income taxes he might owe — $1 million for 2016 and $4.2 million for 2017. But virtually all of that liability was washed away when he eventually filed, and most of the payments were rolled forward to cover potential taxes in future years.

To cancel out the tax bills, Mr. Trump made use of $9.7 million in business investment credits, at least some of which related to his renovation of the Old Post Office hotel, which qualified for a historic-preservation tax break. Although he had more than enough credits to owe no taxes at all, his accountants appear to have carved out an allowance for a small tax liability for both 2016 and 2017.

When they got to line 56, the one for income taxes due, the amount was the same each year: $750.

The $72.9 Million Maneuver

“The Apprentice” created what was probably the biggest income tax bite of Mr. Trump’s life. During the Great Recession bailout, he asked for the money back.

Testifying before Congress in February 2019, the president’s estranged personal lawyer, Mr. Cohen, recalled Mr. Trump’s showing him a huge check from the U.S. Treasury some years earlier and musing “that he could not believe how stupid the government was for giving someone like him that much money back.”

In fact, confidential records show that starting in 2010 he claimed, and received, an income tax refund totaling $72.9 million — all the federal income tax he had paid for 2005 through 2008, plus interest.

The legitimacy of that refund is at the center of the audit battle that he has long been waging, out of public view, with the I.R.S.

The records that The Times reviewed square with the way Mr. Trump has repeatedly cited, without explanation, an ongoing audit as grounds for refusing to release his tax returns. He alluded to it as recently as July on Fox News, when he told Sean Hannity, “They treat me horribly, the I.R.S., horribly.”

And while the records do not lay out all the details of the audit, they match his lawyers’ statement during the 2016 campaign that audits of his returns for 2009 and subsequent years remained open, and involved “transactions or activities that were also reported on returns for 2008 and earlier.”

Mr. Trump harvested that refund bonanza by declaring huge business losses — a total of $1.4 billion from his core businesses for 2008 and 2009 — that tax laws had prevented him from using in prior years.

But to turn that long arc of failure into a giant refund check, he relied on some deft accounting footwork and an unwitting gift from an unlikely source — Mr. Obama.

Business losses can work like a tax-avoidance coupon: A dollar lost on one business reduces a dollar of taxable income from elsewhere. The types and amounts of income that can be used in a given year vary, depending on an owner’s tax status. But some losses can be saved for later use, or even used to request a refund on taxes paid in a prior year.

Until 2009, those coupons could be used to wipe away taxes going back only two years. But that November, the window was more than doubled by a little-noticed provision in a bill Mr. Obama signed as part of the Great Recession recovery effort. Now business owners could request full refunds of taxes paid in the prior four years, and 50 percent of those from the year before that.

Mr. Trump had paid no income taxes in 2008. But the change meant that when he filed his taxes for 2009, he could seek a refund of not just the $13.3 million he had paid in 2007, but also the combined $56.9 million paid in 2005 and 2006, when “The Apprentice” created what was likely the biggest income tax bite of his life.

The records reviewed by The Times indicate that Mr. Trump filed for the first of several tranches of his refund several weeks later, in January 2010. That set off what tax professionals refer to as a “quickie refund,” a check processed in 90 days on a tentative basis, pending an audit by the I.R.S.

His total federal income tax refund would eventually grow to $70.1 million, plus $2,733,184 in interest. He also received $21.2 million in state and local refunds, which often piggyback on federal filings.

Whether Mr. Trump gets to keep the cash, though, remains far from a sure thing.

Refunds require the approval of I.R.S. auditors and an opinion of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, a bipartisan panel better known for reviewing the impact of tax legislation. Tax law requires the committee to weigh in on all refunds larger than $2 million to individuals.

Records show that the results of an audit of Mr. Trump’s refund were sent to the joint committee in the spring of 2011. An agreement was reached in late 2014, the documents indicate, but the audit resumed and grew to include Mr. Trump’s returns for 2010 through 2013. In the spring of 2016, with Mr. Trump closing in on the Republican nomination, the case was sent back to the committee. It has remained there, unresolved, with the statute of limitations repeatedly pushed forward.

Precisely why the case has stalled is not clear. But experts say it suggests that the gap between the sides remains wide. If negotiations were to deadlock, the case would move to federal court, where it could become a matter of public record.

The dispute may center on a single claim that jumps off the page of Mr. Trump’s 2009 tax return: a declaration of more than $700 million in business losses that he had not been allowed to use in prior years. Unleashing that giant tax-avoidance coupon enabled him to receive some or all of his refund.

The material obtained by The Times does not identify the business or businesses that generated those losses. But the losses were a kind that can be claimed only when partners give up their interest in a business. And in 2009, Mr. Trump parted ways with a giant money loser: his long-failing Atlantic City casinos.

Mr. Trump announced in 2009 that he was abandoning his stake in his Atlantic City casino business. Mark Makela for The New York Times

After Mr. Trump’s bondholders rebuffed his offer to buy them out, and with a third round of bankruptcy only a week away, Mr. Trump announced in February 2009 that he was quitting the board of directors.

“If I’m not going to run it, I don’t want to be involved in it,” he told The Associated Press. “I’m one of the largest developers in the world. I have a lot of cash and plenty of places I can go.”

The same day, he notified the Securities and Exchange Commission that he had “determined that his partnership interests are worthless and lack potential to regain value” and was “hereby abandoning” his stake.

The language was crucial. Mr. Trump was using the precise wording of I.R.S. rules governing the most beneficial, and perhaps aggressive, method for business owners to avoid taxes when separating from a business.

A partner who walks away from a business with nothing — what tax laws refer to as abandonment — can suddenly declare all the losses on the business that could not be used in prior years. But there are a few catches, including this: Abandonment is essentially an all-or-nothing proposition. If the I.R.S. learns that the owner received anything of value, the allowable losses are reduced to just $3,000 a year.

And Mr. Trump does appear to have received something. When the casino bankruptcy concluded, he got 5 percent of the stock in the new company. The materials reviewed by The Times do not make clear whether Mr. Trump’s refund application reflected his public declaration of abandonment. If it did, that 5 percent could place his entire refund in question.

If the auditors ultimately disallow Mr. Trump’s $72.9 million federal refund, he will be forced to return that money with interest, and possibly penalties, a total that could exceed $100 million. He could also be ordered to return the state and local refunds based on the same claims.

In response to a question about the audit, Mr. Garten, the Trump Organization lawyer, said facts cited by The Times were incorrect, without citing specifics. He did, however, write that it was “illogical” to say Mr. Trump had not paid taxes for those three years just because the money was later refunded.

“While you claim that President Trump paid no taxes in 10 of the 15 previous years,” Mr. Garten said, “you also assert that President Trump claimed a massive refund for tens of millions for taxes he did pay. These two claims are entirely inconsistent and, in any event, not supported by the facts.”

House Democrats who have been in hot pursuit of Mr. Trump’s tax returns most likely have no idea that at least some of the records are sitting in a congressional office building. George Yin, a former chief of staff for the joint committee, said that any identifying information about taxpayers under review was tightly held among a handful of staff lawyers and was rarely shared with politicians assigned to the committee.

It is possible that the case has been paused because Mr. Trump is president, which would raise the personal stakes of re-election. If the recent Fox interview is any indication, Mr. Trump seems increasingly agitated about the matter.

“It’s a disgrace what’s happened,” he told Mr. Hannity. “We had a deal done. In fact, it was — I guess it was signed even. And once I ran, or once I won, or somewhere back a long time ago, everything was like, ‘Well, let’s start all over again.’ It’s a disgrace.”

The 20 Percent Solution

Helping to reduce Mr. Trump’s tax bills are unidentified consultants’ fees, some of which can be matched to payments received by Ivanka Trump.

Examining the Trump Organization’s tax records, a curious pattern emerges: Between 2010 and 2018, Mr. Trump wrote off some $26 million in unexplained “consulting fees” as a business expense across nearly all of his projects.

In most cases the fees were roughly one-fifth of his income: In Azerbaijan, Mr. Trump collected $5 million on a hotel deal and reported $1.1 million in consulting fees, while in Dubai it was $3 million with a $630,000 fee, and so on.

Mysterious big payments in business deals can raise red flags, particularly in places where bribes or kickbacks to middlemen are routine. But there is no evidence that Mr. Trump, who mostly licenses his name to other people’s projects and is not involved in securing government approvals, has engaged in such practices.

Rather, there appears to be a closer-to-home explanation for at least some of the fees: Mr. Trump reduced his taxable income by treating a family member as a consultant, and then deducting the fee as a cost of doing business.

The “consultants” are not identified in the tax records. But evidence of this arrangement was gleaned by comparing the confidential tax records to the financial disclosures Ivanka Trump filed when she joined the White House staff in 2017. Ms. Trump reported receiving payments from a consulting company she co-owned, totaling $747,622, that exactly matched consulting fees claimed as tax deductions by the Trump Organization for hotel projects in Vancouver and Hawaii.

Ms. Trump had been an executive officer of the Trump companies that received profits from and paid the consulting fees for both projects — meaning she appears to have been treated as a consultant on the same hotel deals that she helped manage as part of her job at her father’s business.

When asked about the arrangement, the Trump Organization lawyer, Mr. Garten, did not comment.

Employers can deduct consulting fees as a business expense and also avoid the withholding taxes that apply to wages. To claim the deduction, the consulting arrangement must be an “ordinary and necessary” part of running the business, with fees that are reasonable and market-based, according to the I.R.S. The recipient of the fees is still required to pay income tax.

The I.R.S. has pursued civil penalties against some business owners who devised schemes to avoid taxes by paying exorbitant fees to related parties who were not in fact independent contractors. A 2011 tax court case centered on the I.R.S.’s denial of almost $3 million in deductions for consulting fees the partners in an Illinois accounting firm paid themselves via corporations they created. The court concluded that the partners had structured the fees to “distribute profits, not to compensate for services.”

There is no indication that the I.R.S. has questioned Mr. Trump’s practice of deducting millions of dollars in consulting fees. If the payments to his daughter were compensation for work, it is not clear why Mr. Trump would do it in this form, other than to reduce his own tax liability. Another, more legally perilous possibility is that the fees were a way to transfer assets to his children without incurring a gift tax.

A Times investigation in 2018 found that Mr. Trump’s late father, Fred Trump, employed a number of legally dubious schemes decades ago to evade gift taxes on millions of dollars he transferred to his children. It is not possible to discern from this newer collection of tax records whether intra-family financial maneuverings were a motivating factor.

However, the fact that some of the consulting fees are identical to those reported by Mr. Trump’s daughter raises the question of whether this was a mechanism the president used to compensate his adult children involved with his business. Indeed, in some instances where large fees were claimed, people with direct knowledge of the projects were not aware of any outside consultants who would have been paid.

On the failed hotel deal in Azerbaijan, which was plagued by suspicions of corruption, a Trump Organization lawyer told The New Yorker the company was blameless because it was merely a licenser and had no substantive role, adding, “We did not pay any money to anyone.” Yet, the tax records for three Trump L.L.C.s involved in that project show deductions for consulting fees totaling $1.1 million that were paid to someone.

In Turkey, a person directly involved in developing two Trump towers in Istanbul expressed bafflement when asked about consultants on the project, telling The Times there was never any consultant or other third party in Turkey paid by the Trump Organization. But tax records show regular deductions for consulting fees over seven years totaling $2 million.

Ms. Trump disclosed in her public filing that the fees she received were paid through TTT Consulting L.L.C., which she said provided “consulting, licensing and management services for real estate projects.” Incorporated in Delaware in December 2005, the firm is one of several Trump-related entities with some variation of TTT or TTTT in the name that appear to refer to members of the Trump family.

Like her brothers Donald Jr. and Eric, Ms. Trump was a longtime employee of the Trump Organization and an executive officer for more than 200 Trump companies that licensed or managed hotel and resort properties. The tax records show that the three siblings had each drawn a salary from their father’s company — roughly $480,000 a year, jumping to about $2 million after Mr. Trump became president — though Ms. Trump no longer receives a salary. What’s more, Mr. Trump has said the children were intimately involved in negotiating and managing his projects. When asked in a 2011 lawsuit deposition whom he relied on to handle important details of his licensing deals, he named only Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric.

On Ms. Trump’s now-defunct website, which explains her role at the Trump Organization, she was not identified as a consultant. Rather, she has been described as a senior executive who “actively participates in all aspects of both Trump and Trump branded projects, including deal evaluation, predevelopment planning, financing, design, construction, sales and marketing, and ensuring that Trump’s world-renowned physical and operational standards are met.

“She is involved in all decisions — large and small.”

The Art of the Write-Off

Hair stylists, table linens, property taxes on a family estate — all have been deducted as business expenses.

Private jets, country clubs and mansions have all had a role in the selling of Donald Trump.

“I play to people’s fantasies,” he wrote in “Trump: The Art of the Deal.” “People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular. I call it truthful hyperbole. It’s an innocent form of exaggeration — and a very effective form of promotion.”

If the singular Trump product is Trump in an exaggerated form — the man, the lifestyle, the acquisitiveness — then everything that feeds the image, including the cost of his businesses, can be written off on his taxes. Mr. Trump may be reporting business losses to the government, but he can still live a life of wealth and write it off.

Take, for example, Mar-a-Lago, now the president’s permanent residence as well as a private club and stage set on which Trump luxury plays out. As a business, it is also the source of millions of dollars in expenses deducted from taxable income, among them $109,433 for linens and silver and $197,829 for landscaping in 2017. Also deducted as a business expense was the $210,000 paid to a Florida photographer over the years for shooting numerous events at the club, including a 2016 New Year’s Eve party hosted by Mr. Trump.

Mar-a-Lago, where a flood of new members starting in 2015 allowed Mr. Trump to pocket an additional $5 million a year from the business, is also a source of millions in tax deductions. Saul Martinez for The New York Times

Mr. Trump has written off as business expenses costs — including fuel and meals — associated with his aircraft, used to shuttle him among his various homes and properties. Likewise the cost of haircuts, including the more than $70,000 paid to style his hair during “The Apprentice.” Together, nine Trump entities have written off at least $95,464 paid to a favorite hair and makeup artist of Ivanka Trump.

In allowing business expenses to be deducted, the I.R.S. requires that they be “ordinary and necessary,” a loosely defined standard often interpreted generously by business owners.

Perhaps Mr. Trump’s most generous interpretation of the business expense write-off is his treatment of the Seven Springs estate in Westchester County, N.Y.

Seven Springs is a throwback to another era. The main house, built in 1919 by Eugene I. Meyer Jr., the onetime head of the Federal Reserve who bought The Washington Post in 1933, sits on more than 200 acres of lush, almost untouched land just an hour’s drive north of New York City.

“The mansion is 50,000 square feet, has three pools, carriage houses, and is surrounded by nature preserves,” according to The Trump Organization website.

Mr. Trump had big plans when he bought the property in 1996 — a golf course, a clubhouse and 15 private homes. But residents of surrounding towns thwarted his ambitions, arguing that development would draw too much traffic and risk polluting the drinking water.

Mr. Trump instead found a way to reap tax benefits from the estate. He took advantage of what is known as a conservation easement. In 2015, he signed a deal with a land conservancy, agreeing not to develop most of the property. In exchange, he claimed a $21.1 million charitable tax deduction.

Mr. Trump classified the Seven Springs estate as an investment property, not a personal residence, allowing for certain tax savings. Meanwhile, Eric Trump has called it a “home base,” and the Trump Organization website describes it as a “retreat for the Trump family.” Tony Cenicola/The New York Times

The tax records reveal another way Seven Springs has generated substantial tax savings. In 2014, Mr. Trump classified the estate as an investment property, as distinct from a personal residence. Since then, he has written off $2.2 million in property taxes as a business expense — even as his 2017 tax law allowed individuals to write off only $10,000 in property taxes a year.

Courts have held that to treat residences as businesses for tax purposes, owners must show that they have “an actual and honest objective of making a profit,” typically by making substantial efforts to rent the property and eventually generating income.

Whether or not Seven Springs fits those criteria, the Trumps have described the property somewhat differently.

In 2014, Eric Trump told Forbes that “this is really our compound.” Growing up, he and his brother Donald Jr. spent many summers there, riding all-terrain vehicles and fishing on a nearby lake. At one point, the brothers took up residence in a carriage house on the property. “It was home base for us for a long, long time,” Eric told Forbes.

And the Trump Organization website still describes Seven Springs as a “retreat for the Trump family.”

Mr. Garten, the Trump Organization lawyer, did not respond to a question about the Seven Springs write-off.

The Seven Springs conservation-easement deduction is one of four that Mr. Trump has claimed over the years. While his use of these deductions is widely known, his tax records show that they represent the lion’s share of his charitable giving — about $119.3 million of roughly $130 million in personal and corporate charitable contributions reported to the I.R.S.

Two of those deductions — at Seven Springs and at the Trump National Golf Club in Los Angeles — are the focus of an investigation by the New York attorney general, who is examining whether the appraisals on the land, and therefore the tax deductions, were inflated.

Another common deductible expense for all businesses is legal fees. The I.R.S. requires that these fees be “directly related to operating your business,” and businesses cannot deduct “legal fees paid to defend charges that arise from participation in a political campaign.”

Yet the tax records show that the Trump Corporation wrote off as business expenses fees paid to a criminal defense lawyer, Alan S. Futerfas, who was hired to represent Donald Trump Jr. during the Russia inquiry. Investigators were examining Donald Jr.’s role in the 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians who had promised damaging information on Mrs. Clinton. When he testified before Congress in 2017, Mr. Futerfas was by his side.

Mr. Futerfas was also hired to defend the president’s embattled charitable foundation, which would be shut down in 2018 after New York regulators said it had engaged in “a shocking pattern of illegality.”

The Trump Corporation paid Mr. Futerfas at least $1.9 million in 2017 and 2018, tax records show. Also written off was at least $259,684 paid to Williams & Jensen, another law firm brought in during the same period to represent Donald Trump Jr.

A President and a Businessman

Deals in countries led by strongmen, tenants who have business before the federal government, and hotels and clubs that draw those seeking access or favor.

In May, the chairman of a trade group representing Turkish business interests wrote to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross urging support for increased trade between the United States and Turkey. The ultimate goal was nothing less than “reorienting the U.S. supply chain away from China.”

The letter was among three sent to cabinet secretaries by Mehmet Ali Yalcindag, chairman of the Turkey-U.S. Business Council, who noted that he had copied each one to Mr. Trump.

The president needed no introduction to Mr. Yalcindag: The Turkish businessman helped negotiate a licensing deal in 2008 for his family’s company to develop two Trump towers in Istanbul. The tax records show the deal has earned Mr. Trump at least $13 million — far more than previously known — including more than $1 million since he entered the White House, even as his onetime associate now lobbies on behalf of Turkish interests.

Mr. Yalcindag said he had “remained friendly” with Mr. Trump since their work together years ago, but that all communications between his trade group and the administration “go through formal channels and are properly disclosed.”

The ethical quandaries created by Mr. Trump’s decision to keep his business while in the White House have been documented. But the full financial measure of his extraordinary confluence of interests — a president with a wealth of business entanglements at home and in myriad geopolitical hot spots — has remained elusive.

The tax records for Mr. Trump and his hundreds of companies show precisely how much money he has received over the years, and how heavily he has come to rely on leveraging his brand in ways that pose potential or direct conflicts of interest while he is president. The records also provide the first reliable window onto his finances before 2014, the earliest year covered by his required annual disclosures, showing that his total profits from some projects outside the United States were larger than indicated by those limited public filings.

Based on the financial disclosures, which report much of his income in broad ranges, Mr. Trump’s earnings from the Istanbul towers could have been as low as $3.2 million. In the Philippines, where he licensed his name to a Manila tower nearly a decade ago, the low end of the range was $4.1 million — less than half of the $9.3 million he actually made. In Azerbaijan, he collected more than $5 million for the failed hotel project, about twice what appeared on his public filings.

It did not take long for conflicts to emerge when Mr. Trump ran for president and won. The Philippines’ strongman leader, Rodrigo Duterte, chose as a special trade envoy to Washington the businessman behind the Trump tower in Manila. In Argentina, a key person who had been involved in a Uruguayan licensing deal that earned Mr. Trump $2.3 million was appointed to a cabinet post.

The president’s conflicts have been most evident with Turkey, where the business community and the authoritarian government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan have not hesitated to leverage various Trump enterprises to their advantage. When Turkish-American relations were at a low point, a Turkish business group canceled a conference at Mr. Trump’s Washington hotel; six months later, when the two countries were on better terms, the rescheduled event was attended by Turkish government officials. Turkish Airlines also chose the Trump National Golf Club in suburban Virginia to host an event.

More broadly, the tax records suggest other ways in which Mr. Trump’s presidency has propped up his sagging bottom line. Monthly credit card receipts, reported to the I.R.S. by third-party card processing firms, reflect the way certain of his resorts, golf courses and hotels became favored stomping grounds, if not venues for influence-trading, beginning in 2015 and continuing into his time in the White House.

The credit card data does not reflect total revenue, and is useful mainly for showing short-term ups and downs of consumer interest in a business. While two of Mr. Trump’s marquee draws — the Washington hotel in the Old Post Office and the Doral golf resort — are loaded with debt and continue to lose money, both have seen credit card transactions rise markedly with his political ascent.

Though the Trump International Hotel in Washington is loaded with debt and losing money, its credit card transactions have risen with Mr. Trump’s political ascent. Al Drago for The New York Times

At the hotel, the monthly receipts grew from $3.7 million in December 2016 shortly after it opened, to $5.4 million in January 2017 and $6 million by May 2018. At Doral, after Mr. Trump declared his candidacy in June 2015, credit card revenue more than doubled, to $13 million, for the three months through August, compared with the same period the year before.

One Trump enterprise that has been regularly profitable, and is a persistent source of concern about ethical conflicts and national security lapses, is the Mar-a-Lago club. Profits there rose sharply after Mr. Trump declared his candidacy, as courtiers eagerly joining up brought a tenfold rise in cash from initiation fees — from $664,000 in 2014 to just under $6 million in 2016, even before Mr. Trump doubled the cost of initiation in January 2017. The membership rush allowed the president to take $26 million out of the business from 2015 through 2018, nearly triple the rate at which he had paid himself in the prior two years.

Some of the largest payments from business groups for events or conferences at Mar-a-Lago and other Trump properties have come since Mr. Trump became president, the tax records show.

At Doral, Mr. Trump collected a total of at least $7 million in 2015 and 2016 from Bank of America, and at least $1.2 million in 2017 and 2018 from a trade association representing food retailers and wholesalers. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce paid Doral at least $406,599 in 2018.

Beyond one-time payments for events or memberships, large corporations also pay rent for space in the few commercial buildings Mr. Trump actually owns. Walgreens, the pharmacy giant that resolved an antitrust matter before federal regulators in 2017, pays $3.4 million a year for a lease at 40 Wall Street, a Trump-owned office building in Manhattan.

Another renter at 40 Wall, for $2.5 million a year, is Atane Engineers, which changed its name in 2018 after a corruption scandal that culminated in two former top executives’ pleading guilty to paying bribes for city infrastructure contracts. Despite the criminal case — which landed the company on New York State’s list of “non-responsible entities” that require a waiver to obtain state contracts — the newly christened Atane registered as an eligible federal contractor with no restrictions listed in its file.

Rental income over all at 40 Wall has risen markedly, from $30.5 million in 2014 to $43.2 million in 2018. The tax records show that the cost of existing leases there has risen, and at least four law firms appear to have moved in since Mr. Trump ran for president.

Mr. Trump has a 30 percent stake in two valuable office towers, including one in Midtown Manhattan, shared with and managed by Vornado Realty Trust.

Jim Wilson/The New York Times

In addition to buildings he owns outright, there is the president’s stake in the Vornado partnerships that control two valuable office towers — 1290 Sixth Avenue in Manhattan and 555 California Street in San Francisco. Vornado’s chief executive, Steven Roth, is a close Trump ally recently named to the White House economic recovery council. Last year, the president appointed Mr. Roth’s wife, Daryl Roth, to the Kennedy Center board of trustees.

Vornado tenants include a roster of blue-chip firms paying multimillion-dollar leases, many of whom regularly do business with, lobby or are regulated by the federal government. Among the dozens of leases paid in 2018 to Mr. Trump’s Vornado partnerships, according to his tax records, were $5.8 million from Goldman Sachs; $3.1 million from Microsoft; $32.7 million from Neuberger Berman, an investment management company; and $8.8 million from the law firm Kirkland & Ellis.

The Gathering Storm

Threats are converging: mounting business losses, the looming I.R.S. audit and personally guaranteed debts coming due.

When Mr. Trump glided down a gilded Trump Tower escalator to kick off his presidential campaign in June 2015, his finances needed a jolt.

His core businesses were reporting mounting losses — more than $100 million over the previous two years. The river of celebrity-driven income that had long buoyed them was running dry.

If Mr. Trump hoped his unlikely candidacy might, at least, revitalize his brand, his barrage of derogatory remarks about immigrants quickly cost him two of his biggest and easiest sources of cash — licensing deals with clothing and mattress manufacturers that had netted him more than $30 million. NBC, his partner in Miss Universe — source of nearly $20 million in profits — announced that it would no longer broadcast the pageant; he sold it soon after.

Now his tax records make clear that he is facing a battery of threats to his business and his own financial well-being.

Over the past decade, he appears to have filled the cash-flow gaps with a series of one-shots that may not be available again.

In 2012, he took out a $100 million mortgage on the commercial space in Trump Tower. He took nearly the entire amount as a payout, his tax records show. His company has paid more than $15 million in interest on the loan, but nothing on the principal. The full $100 million comes due in 2022.

In 2013, he withdrew $95.8 million from his Vornado partnership account.

And in January 2014, he sold $98 million in stocks and bonds, his biggest single month of sales in at least the last two decades. He sold $54 million more in stocks and bonds in 2015, and $68.2 million in 2016. His financial disclosure released in July showed that he had as little as $873,000 in securities left to sell.

Mr. Trump’s businesses reported cash on hand of $34.7 million in 2018, down 40 percent from five years earlier.

What’s more, the tax records show that Mr. Trump has once again done what he says he regrets, looking back on his early 1990s meltdown: personally guaranteed hundreds of millions of dollars in loans, a decision that led his lenders to threaten to force him into personal bankruptcy.

This time around, he is personally responsible for loans and other debts totaling $421 million, with most of it coming due within four years. Should he win re-election, his lenders could be placed in the unprecedented position of weighing whether to foreclose on a sitting president.

There is, however, a tax benefit for Mr. Trump. While business owners can use losses to avoid taxes, they can do so only up to the amount invested in the business. But by taking personal responsibility for that $421 million in debt, Mr. Trump would be able to declare that amount in losses in future years.

The balances on those loans had not been paid down by the end of 2018. And the businesses carrying the bulk of the debt — the Doral golf resort ($125 million) and the Washington hotel ($160 million) — are struggling, which could make it difficult to find a lender willing to refinance it.

The unresolved audit of his $72.9 million tax refund hangs over his head.

The broader economy promises little relief. Across the country, brick-and-mortar stores are in decline, and they have been very important to Trump Tower, which has in turn been very important to Mr. Trump. Nike, which rented the space for its flagship store in a building attached to Trump Tower and had paid $195.1 million in rent since the 1990s, left in 2018.

The president’s most recent financial disclosure reported modest gains in 2019. But that was before the pandemic hit. His already struggling properties were shut down for several months earlier this year. The Doral resort asked Deutsche Bank to allow a delay on its loan payments. Analysts have predicted that the hotel business will not fully recover until late 2023.

Mr. Trump still has assets to sell. But doing so could take its own toll, both financial and to Mr. Trump’s desire to always be seen as a winner. The Trump family said last year that it was considering selling the Washington hotel, but not because it was losing money.

In Mr. Trump’s telling, any difficulty in his finances has been caused by the sacrifices made for his current job.

“They say, ‘Trump is getting rich off our nation,’” he said at a rally in Minneapolis last October. “I lose billions being president, and I don’t care. It’s nice to be rich, I guess, but I lose billions.”

l4b37c	liberal	Ted Cruz's 'Pittsburgh over Paris' campaign shows us just how dumb the Biden years are going to be	"Getty

In response to Biden re-entering the US into the Paris climate agreement, GOP Sen. Ted Cruz has launched a ""Pittsburgh over Paris"" campaign.

Cruz says that Biden rejoining the Paris agreement will cost the citizens of Pittsburgh jobs, but the idea makes no sense and is just another bad faith attempt at scoring political points.

This is the norm for Republicans, and a sign of what's to come.

This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Before the ink could even dry on Joe Biden's first batch of Executive Orders as president, Republicans went back into their bag of obstructionist shenanigans.

Mitch McConnell, the leader of the GOP's new Senate minority, criticized Biden's day one actions, trying to cast them as a wave of radical policies. McConnell said that Biden should ""remember that he does not owe his election to the far-left.""

But Biden's actions reflected mainstream views supported by a wide swath of the American public. And his stances against ""Defund the police,"" unconditional student loan forgiveness, and Medicare For All make it clear Biden is - as he always said - a moderate. McConnell's complaints are thinly veiled attempts to paint anything more liberal than hardcore GOP policies as ""socialism"" or ""too far left.""

Then, QAnon-friendly Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green immediately filed Articles of Impeachment. She released a five-second long announcement video stating as much. It has something to do with Ukraine, but the statement announcing the impeachment frankly didn't make much sense.

Despite national calls for unity, it took the length of Biden's inauguration speech before the Republicans' returned to bad-faith strategy.

Nowhere was this clearer than with potential 2024 GOP presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz. In response to Biden re-entering the US into the Paris climate accord, an international agreement to curb climate change, Cruz launched a campaign of his own.

Story continues

It's called ""Pittsburgh over Paris"" and it's a sign of just how dumb things are going to get in the Biden era.

Read more: Biden promised a return to 'normalcy,' but it's clear that's not happening anytime soon.

Here we go again

Black and yellow, the official colors of the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers, and thus the unofficial colors of Pittsburgh itself, are the colors used in Ted Cruz's latest 2024 gambit: a ""Pittsburgh over Paris"" bumper sticker that he's giving away, pictured below.

TedCruz/Twitter

Nothing says ""Pittsburgh"" like an image that prominently features the shape of Texas.

Cruz's fake outrage in service of Pittsburghians is a head-scratcher. What does ""Pittsburgh over Paris"" even mean? Why does trying to curb the harsh effects of climate change hurt Pittsburgh? Why pick a city that has actually set ambitious goals to tackle climate change, like shifting to 100% renewable energy in City buildings by 2030?

Cruz says the Paris agreement will ""destroy jobs,"" presumably in Pittsburgh, but the city voted overwhelmingly for Biden - who repeatedly pledged to return to the Paris Agreement. Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto on Thursday said he agreed with Biden's decision. County Executive Rich Fitzgerald of Allegheny, where Pittsburgh is located, blasted Cruz's slogan.

""We'll run what we need to do here, Senator, and keep your nose out of our business,"" Fitzgerald told reporters.

Did Ted Cruz just choose Pittsburgh because it starts with the same letter as Paris? He did, didn't he?

All of this is frustrating because Cruz doesn't care about Pittsburgh. He made that clear when he attempted to disenfranchise the city's biggest county, Allegheny, when he not only helped incite an insurrection to throw out their votes but also doubled down on that sentiment hours after. Instead, what Cruz is trying to do is set up a cultural foundation to run for president in 2024. For this reason, this stunt should not be taken seriously.

Cruz's glib slogan isn't about actual policy or concern for the workers in Pittsburgh (many of whom could probably get a steady job in green energy if the GOP actually supported investment in the industry), it's about political opportunity. Despite their calls for unity, Republicans are gearing up for another cycle of mischief and misdeeds. So all this talk about Pittsburgh should be taken with an Allegheny-sized grain of salt.

That's what worries me about the next four years. Biden's term is poised to be rife with Republican virtue-signaling. The virtue signal, or the disingenuous expression of moral fortitude, is the most used play in their playbook, which includes pretending to be concerned about the national debt despite embracing spending when they're in charge, and calling everything to the left of Ronald Reagan ""radical socialism.""

Cruz is the face of Republican virtue-signaling despite perpetually complaining about the practice. In fact, Cruz's anti-virtue-signaling stance is a virtue signal within a virtue signal - which sounds like the plot of the lamest possible Christopher Nolan film.

It's going to be hard for us to out-absurd the days of the Trump administration, considering the then-president made news for staring directly into the sun during a solar eclipse, among many, many other things. But given that we've already reached critical eye-roll levels in the first days of the Biden administration, it's not looking like it's going to get much better either.

k8wxu8	liberal	Pentagon advisor resigns in protest, saying the Trump administration is putting the nation 'at risk' by purging posts to fill them with loyalists	"One of the few members of the Defense Business Board to survive a recent purge has resigned from the Pentagon advisory group in protest, CNN first reported.

In his resignation letter, Steve Blank wrote that by purging advisory boards and filling them with allies of President Donald Trump, the Trump administration had ""put the nation's safety and security at risk.""

The purge of the Defense Business Board last week followed the removal of most of the Defense Policy Board late last month.

The Trump administration has also purged much of the Pentagon's civilian leadership, clearing the way for loyalists to fill top posts.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

One of the few members of an important Pentagon advisory board who survived a recent purge has resigned in protest, and he sharply criticized President Donald Trump on his way out.

The White House on Friday pushed out nine members of the Defense Business Board, an independent panel of leading outside experts who provide advice to senior Pentagon leaders, and replaced some members with Trump allies, such as Corey Lewandowski, a former Trump campaign manager, and David Bossie, a former campaign staffer.

Acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller said last Friday that he was ""proud to welcome each of these new members to the Defense Business Board.""

He added that ""these individuals have a proven record of achievement within their respective fields and have demonstrated leadership that will serve our Department, and our nation well.""

Steve Blank, one of the few remaining members, resigned on Monday, writing in his resignation letter that ""the abrupt termination of more than half of the Defense Business Board and their replacement with political partisans has now put the nation's safety and security at risk,"" CNN first reported.

""My service to the Department of Defense was a service to the country not to a party,"" he wrote. ""I hereby tender my resignation.""

The Politico reporter Lara Seligman posted a copy of Blank's resignation letter on Twitter.

The Defense Business Board shake-up followed the White House's removal last month of 11 of the 13 members of the Defense Policy Board, a group of outside advisors who offer their perspectives on defense and national-security matters.

In addition to pushing out defense advisors, the Trump administration has purged several senior Pentagon officials.

On November 9, Trump abruptly fired Mark Esper as secretary of defense, replacing him with Miller, who was previously the director of the National Counterterrorism Center.

The next day, three more Pentagon officials resigned: Jen Stewart, the chief of staff to the secretary of defense; James Anderson, the undersecretary of defense for policy; and Joseph Kernan, the undersecretary of defense for intelligence and security.

Those important positions within the Pentagon were filled by the Trump loyalists Anthony Tata, a retired general and occasional Fox News guest, and Ezra Cohen-Watnick and Kash Patel, former National Security Council officials.

Last week, reports said Chris Maier, the head of the Pentagon's Defeat ISIS Task Force, was forced to resign after a White House liaison told him that the war against ISIS had been won and that his office was being disbanded.

l24t3w	liberal	Biden Has Already Fired Three of Trump’s Worst Appointees	"Many of Donald Trump’s most notorious appointees, including his Cabinet secretaries, resigned shortly before Joe Biden took office. But myriad officials whom Trump installed in the executive branch remained in spite of their antagonism toward the new president’s agenda. Hours into his presidency, Biden has already ousted three of his predecessors’ most unqualified and corrupt appointees. This clean break sends a clear message that Biden will not tolerate hostile Trump holdovers in his administration, including those with time remaining in their terms.

First, Biden terminated Michael Pack, who was confirmed to head the U.S. Agency for Global Media in June. Pack sought to transform the agency, which oversees the international broadcaster Voice of America, into a propaganda outlet for Trump—despite a statutory mandate that prohibits such political interference. He purged the staff of VOA and its sister networks, replaced them with Trump loyalists, demanded pro-Trump coverage, and unconstitutionally punished remaining journalists who did actual reporting on the administration. In a perverse move, he refused to renew visas for foreign reporters who covered their home countries, subjecting them to retribution by authoritarian regimes. Pack also illegally fired the board of the Open Technology Fund, which promotes international internet freedom, and replaced them with Republican activists.

Following whistleblower complaints, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel found a “substantial likelihood” that Pack had violated federal law and engaged in “gross mismanagement.” He was eight months into his three-year term when Biden demanded his resignation shortly after taking the oath of office. In his resignation letter, Pack complained that his termination “will long be viewed as a partisan act” without any apparent sense of irony.

Second, Biden sacked Kathleen Kraninger, who was confirmed as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2018. Kraninger, who had no previous experience in consumer protection, immediately tried to undermine the agency’s role as a watchdog for the financial sector. She scrapped a landmark rule that restricted predatory payday lending, pressuring staff to downplay the resulting harm to consumers. And she refused to enforce a federal law that protected military personnel against a broad range of predatory lending. Her decision yanked federal support from military families who were defrauded by lenders. In the midst of the pandemic, Kraninger also approved a rule that allows debt collectors to harass Americans with limitless texts and emails demanding repayment.

Through the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress gave the CFPB’s director significant independence by barring the president from firing her over political disagreements. In 2020, though, the Supreme Court found this protection unconstitutional. Kraninger supported that decision, which paved the way for her termination on Wednesday. Had the court upheld the agency’s independence, Kraninger could have remained in office through the end of 2023.

Third, Biden demanded the resignation of Peter Robb, who was confirmed as the National Labor Relations Board’s general counsel in 2017. The NLRB was created to enforce federal laws that guarantee workers the right to form a union and bargain collectively. Yet Robb is vehemently anti-union; during his tenure, he tried to limit employees’ free speech, give managers more leeway to engage in wage theft, hobble unions’ ability to collect dues, and prevent employers from helping workers organize. He also tried to seize near-total control of the agency by demoting every regional director and consolidating power in his office. If successful, this gambit would’ve given him unprecedented authority to bust existing unions and prevent new ones from forming.

Robb’s term is set to end in November, but Biden has authority to fire him before then. On Wednesday evening, Robb announced that he would not step down voluntarily, stating that his resignation “would set an unfortunate precedent.” (In reality, the precedent has already been set: President Harry Truman demanded the resignation of NLRB general counsel Robert N. Denham in 1950 over political disputes.) Biden fired him shortly thereafter.

Pack, Kraninger, and Robb are the tip of the iceberg: Trump spent his presidency packing the federal government with Republicans eager to undermine the missions of the agencies they led. But Biden’s aggressive action upon taking office should be encouraging for progressives, since it indicates that the new president will move swiftly to fire Trump allies with high positions in the executive branch. Moreover, Biden should not have much trouble replacing these holdovers with Democrats in control of the Senate. (Republicans cannot filibuster nominees to the executive branch.) The new president undoubtedly faces legislative challenges ahead. But in the meantime, he can rapidly erase the legacy of the Trump administration by simply replacing Trump’s lackeys with qualified civil servants eager to do the job right.

Update, Jan. 20, 2021: This article has been updated to note that Peter Robb refused to step down."	left

i329ia	liberal	Trump continues to lose ground in 2020 election as nation grapples with coronavirus	"(CNN) The national political landscape has clearly and significantly shifted in Joe Biden's favor since he emerged as the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee back in March just as the public health emergency was taking hold.

Given the continuing widespread coronavirus pandemic , the persistent economic devastation millions of Americans are experiencing in its wake and President Donald Trump's inability to wrest control of the crisis in the minds of a majority of Americans, it is probably not all that surprising that his reelection chances have taken a substantial hit.

Perhaps the more surprising development is that nothing Trump and his campaign team have tried over the last two months to turn those fortunes around seems to be working. And they have certainly tried

From launching a law-and-order message in the face of mostly peaceful protests for racial justice, to Trump shaking up the campaign by demoting his campaign manager, to a short-lived attempt at having the President portray himself as a leader in command of the Covid-19 response, the race for the White House has continued to move in Biden's direction.

While the cliché is true that the three months from now until Election Day is an eternity in American politics and the race is almost certain to tighten, it is also true that Americans are just six weeks away from beginning to cast ballots and the defining characteristic of this presidential race thus far is Trump's failed leadership in managing the coronavirus pandemic and an inability to convince enough of the public that Biden is an unacceptable alternative.

Whatever thin cushion existed for Trump's reelection prospects at the start of this election year has completely evaporated. The President's path to 270 electoral votes is as narrow as it has ever been. For his part, former Vice President Biden is shoring up some traditionally blue-leaning battleground states, expanding the 2020 battleground map into what has recently been more Republican leaning terrain, and opening up multiple pathways to victory.

Based on public and private polling, where the campaigns are placing their strategic bets with millions of advertising dollars, where the candidates and their surrogates are spending time in person or virtually, conversations with Trump and Biden campaign advisers, Republican and Democratic political operatives, members of Congress, and political professionals involved with outside groups, our current Electoral College outlook reflects that substantial movement in Biden's direction.

Since our last outlook, we have moved five states (and one congressional district) in the direction of the Democrat. Michigan and Pennsylvania, two states Trump won in 2016 that had been reliably blue for the better part of two decades in presidential elections, are being moved from battleground to lean Democrat, placing an additional 36 electoral votes to Biden's total. We've also moved Virginia from lean Democrat to solid Democrat as the demographics and population shifts in the commonwealth continue to trend away from Republicans and both campaigns appear to be disinclined to spend substantial dollars competing there.

In addition, Georgia, Ohio and Maine's 2nd Congressional District had all been leaning in Trump's favor in our last outlook and have now all been moved to the battleground category, which reduces Trump's electoral vote count by 35 votes.

In this new outlook, Trump starts with a solid base of 125 electoral votes from 20 states that are most likely to be uncontested in the fall. When you combine that base of solid states with the additional 45 electoral votes that are currently leaning in his direction, it brings Trump's total to 170 electoral votes -- 100 votes away from reelection.

Biden's quest for the White House starts with a solid base of 203 electoral votes from 16 states and the District of Columbia. When you add in the 65 electoral votes that are leaning in his direction, it brings his total to 268 electoral votes -- just 2 away from winning the presidency.

That leaves us with six states and a congressional district worth a total of 100 electoral votes that will likely prove decisive in selecting the direction the country heads in for the next four years: Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Maine's 2nd Congressional District, North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin.

If Biden were to win everything in dark or light blue on this map, Donald Trump would need to run the table and win every single battleground to get reelected.

lt35oo	liberal	Ted Cruz's colleagues mocked him by putting memes of his Cancun trip in the Senate gym locker room: 'Bienvenido de Nuevo, Ted!'	"Ted Cruz's Senate colleagues had some fun at his expense on Wednesday, according to NBC News.

Photos of Cruz from his infamous Cancun trip were plastered around the Senate gym's locker room.

""Bienvenido de Nuevo, Ted!"" the color printouts for the prank read, or ""welcome back.""

Visit the Business section of Insider for more stories.

With so many former class presidents crammed into one place, Capitol Hill proved vulnerable to high-school hijinks on Wednesday morning.

After his infamous Cancun junket, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas was the subject of a prank in the locker room of the Senate gym midweek, Carol Lee and Leigh Ann Caldwell of NBC News reported.

Early birds turning up for a workout Wednesday morning came across color printouts of Cruz in his airport getup, which included a light polo shirt and a mask bearing the Texas flag, according to NBC, who reviewed the materials provided by two sources.

""The rendering featured a manipulated photo of Cruz from his well-documented trip to Mexico, dragging his luggage across an arctic landscape while holding a tropical cocktail garnished with a slice of fruit in his other hand,"" Lee and Caldwell wrote.

The printouts included a crossover meme, with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont's viral pose in mittens at President Joe Biden's inauguration photoshopped into the frigid backdrop, NBC said.

Beyond the optics of the Cruz Cancun trip, blowback intensified after Houston police confirmed they received a request for security assistance from Cruz's office, and sent a detail to the airport as first responders were stretched thin during the life-threatening power and utilities crisis.

Sometime later on Wednesday, the photos were taken down, according to the report.

Only current and former senators are allowed in the gym, which has been the source of other Capitol Hill drama, such as when Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky took heat for getting a workout in after he had tested positive for COVID-19.

Cruz's office did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

It remains unclear who carried out the prank."	left
hpw12a	liberal	Historians will likely rank Trump as one of the worst presidents	"Trump's approval rating isn't getting any better. In the polls, he is continuing to lose to former Vice President Joe Biden by double-digits. Trump could win a second term, but there is no clear path to doing so.

If Trump does go on to lose in November, he doesn't just need to worry about losing to Biden. Trump needs to worry about the fact that the history books are probably going to put him down as a below average president, if not one of the worst.

While I have my problems with historical rankings of presidents as an exercise (e.g. the graders tend to be far more liberal than the population at large), they are a good guide into understanding how history remembers presidents. The presidents viewed at the top of the lists (George Washington and Abraham Lincoln historically) or near the top (Ronald Reagan) tend to be thought of fondly. Meanwhile, those at or near the bottom of the list (such as James Buchanan and Andrew Johnson) are generally thought of as failures as president.

The biggest factor separating those who rate highly and those who don't is whether they win a second term in office. Take a look at an average ranking by experts in the 2018 American Political Science Association poll and 2018 Siena College poll.

The average ranking for presidents who win a second term is 14th. That's well above average given we've had 44 presidents. None ranked lower than 32nd (George W. Bush). The best was the top spot overall (Washington).

The average for presidents who did not win a second term is 30th. That's well below average. None of the presidents who didn't have a second term ranked higher than 13th (John Kennedy, who was assassinated). The worst was last overall (Buchanan).

Just on this basis alone, you'd think that Trump would probably go down as below average if he lost in November. We wouldn't know quite where he'd land, but it'd be a pretty good bet that he wouldn't finish in the top half.

I'd bet Trump would dip even lower given where the historians already have him. The average of the APSA and Siena polls put Trump at 43rd, which ties him for last with Buchanan.

At the time the APSA poll was published, I urged caution since it was one poll done early in Trump's presidency. Now, we have the Siena poll as well. Additionally, more voters by far said Trump was the worst president since World War II in a 2018 Quinnipiac University poll . (Few ranked him as the best, which is very different from a similar poll taken during Obama's second term.)

Importantly, these early rankings are generally predictive of later rankings in a look back at presidents since Franklin Roosevelt (the first modern presidential ranking was completed three years after he last held office ).

Since 1948, the final historian rankings of a president during their time in office (or the first after they leave office) has differed from their current ranking by just four spots. The median difference has been a mere two spots. The presidents who tend to improve the most (such as Dwight Eisenhower) are ones who get that second term.

Now, there is obviously some chance Trump could be ranked higher than at the end of 2018. I tend to doubt it, though, because his standing among the public is not any better now than it was then.

All told, historians at the end of his first term are likely going to view Trump quite negatively. His only real chance of seeing improvement is to earn that second term, which seems to be something that is becoming less likely by the day."	left
j37w7k	liberal	Donald Trump Refused to Denounce White Supremacists. That's It.	"At the first presidential debate of the 2020 general election, the President of the United States refused to condemn white supremacists and told a far-right paramilitary street gang that openly supports him that they should ""stand by."" This is not hyperbole. This is not some dramatic interpretation. It is simply what he said. He was asked to condemn white supremacy and he would not. He seemed almost confused at the suggestion. Instead, he directly addressed the Proud Boys, who have violently attacked their political opponents in the street before, and said that they should ""stand back and stand by.""

Trump: ""Proud Boys, stand back and stand by! But I'll tell you what, somebody's got to do something about antifa and the left."" pic.twitter.com/4vrPocKzcu — Axios (@axios) September 30, 2020

What on earth would they be standing by for? Could it be for when, as he once again signaled he would do here, he declares the election was rigged? He again refused to say that he would respect the results of a democratic election. Because he won't. He's already said, as he did in 2016, that he will accept the results if he wins. And what happens if he doesn't, and he says it was stolen from him? What will his most extreme supporters, who believe he is all that stands between them and the abyss, do then?

Even if you grant that ""stand by"" might have been a blurt-of-the-moment thing, why is the president incapable of condemning white supremacy? After the terror in Charlottesville, in which a white supremacist murdered an anti-racist protester with his car, he said that ""very fine people"" march alongside Ku Klux Klan members and neo-Nazis. Now there are incidents of cars running into protesters all the time. A man who is self-identifying as a part of a ""militia"" shot two protesters dead in the street in Kenosha, Wisconsin in August. Oh, and the Proud Boys are reportedly already celebrating this line—""Stand Back, Stand By""—as a sort of slogan. Seems like they got the message.

We are living on a knife's edge already, and the president is declaring the election will be rigged—""this is going to be a fraud like you’ve never seen""—and telling his supporters they should go ""monitor"" polling places on Election Day. He specifically mentioned Philadelphia, a predominantly Democratic city in a key swing state, where he said ""bad things happen.""

None of this is true. There is no evidence ""tens of thousands of ballots will be manipulated."" He is just making it up. But the consequences will be very real.

Meanwhile, poll watchers are a feature of elections in every state, but you're supposed to formally register for the gig. Also, Republicans have been banned from deploying poll watchers since the 1980s after they entered a consent decree following allegations they'd engaged in voter intimidation in a New Jersey gubernatorial election. Of course, a federal judge threw out that consent decree just in time for this election, and the Republican Party is sinking tens of millions of dollars into the effort. But it's not even clear Trump is referring to this formal program. He may simply aim to foment chaos for people voting in person on Election Day, having already tried to discourage people from voting by mail.



The president has repeatedly refused to condemn white supremacists. That’s it. OLIVIER DOULIERY Getty Images

We seem to have memory-holed it, but a devout fan of the president sent mail bombs to the houses of Democrats and major media figures who were regularly featured on the president's list of enemies. Another man drove hours to an El Paso Walmart and shot the place up, publishing a manifesto that made clear he was targeting Hispanic people he found there, and which often echoed the president's rhetoric on immigration. Another man shot up a Pittsburgh synagogue based on a conspiracy theory related to The Caravan the president obsessed over leading up to the 2018 midterm elections.

The president's performance on the night of Tuesday, September 29, 2020, was of a piece with everything that he has presented to the world in his time in public life. He trafficked in wild conspiracy theories, he attacked his opponent's family, he interrupted constantly to spout nonsense. Joe Biden was meandering at times, and he did not set the world on fire. But he has pledged to accept the results of the goddamned election, and while he isn't as sharp as he once was, he appears to have a basic capacity for human empathy and impulse control. Oh, and he denounces white supremacists. The president will not. He cannot stop himself from welcoming them because they support him. And why do the white supremacists support the president? Why do the Klansmen and the neo-Nazis who showed up in Charlottesville all feel so jazzed about the current occupant of the White House? And if they're so happy, should anyone else be?

ho3vv4	liberal	Supreme Court says Manhattan district attorney can get Trump tax records	"The Supreme Court on Thursday delivered split opinions in two cases over whether President Donald Trump can shield his tax records from investigators, handing a win to the Manhattan district attorney but rejecting efforts by House Democrats.

Both cases were decided 7-2, with Chief Justice John Roberts authoring the court's opinions and joined in the majority by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented in both cases.

Both cases are subject to further review by lower courts. The justices rejected the president's claims that he was immune from state criminal subpoenas in the New York case. In the congressional case, they wiped away rulings in favor of House Democrats, ordering lower courts to more carefully consider concerns about the separation of powers.

The mixed rulings mean the American public is unlikely to learn about Trump's financial records or tax information before November's election. It is not clear when the lower courts may ultimately resolve the matter.

The decisions mark the first time that the nation's highest court has directly ruled on a matter involving Trump's personal dealings. Trump has been more secretive with his finances than any president in decades, refusing to release his tax records to the public even as he mounts a bid for reelection.

The cases were decided on the final day of the Supreme Court's term, which began last October and was extended past its typical end-of-June conclusion as a result of precautions taken against the spreading coronavirus.

""In our judicial system, 'the public has a right to every man's evidence.' Since the earliest days of the Republic, 'every man' has included the President of the United States,"" Roberts wrote in the New York case.

The New York case stems from an investigation being pursued by Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance Jr. Vance issued a subpoena to Trump's longtime accounting firm, Mazars, for a wide variety of Trump's personal and business records, including tax returns, dating to 2011.

Vance's office is investigating the hush money payments that Trump allegedly facilitated to two women ahead of the 2016 election, though the purpose for his subpoenas is relatively opaque.

The women have claimed to have had sexual relationships with the president that he has denied. Vance hasn't said whether Trump is a suspect in his investigation, and he has not indicated any potential charges.

Trump's attorneys had pushed for an expansive view of presidential immunity in the case.

In one lower court hearing in New York, an attorney for the president said Trump would theoretically be immune from investigation even if he shot someone on New York's Fifth Avenue. During the 2016 campaign, Trump claimed that he could ""stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters.""

In a statement, Vance called Thursday's decision ""a tremendous victory for our nation's system of justice and its founding principle that no one – not even a president – is above the law.""

""Our investigation, which was delayed for almost a year by this lawsuit, will resume, guided as always by the grand jury's solemn obligation to follow the law and the facts, wherever they may lead,"" Vance said.

Jay Sekulow, an attorney for Trump, said in a statement that ""we are pleased that in the decisions issued today, the Supreme Court has temporarily blocked both Congress and New York prosecutors from obtaining the President's financial records.""

""We will now proceed to raise additional Constitutional and legal issues in the lower courts,"" Sekulow said.

Despite Sekulow's guarded optimism, it was clear from Trump's response that the president did not see the rulings as victories.

""Now the Supreme Court gives a delay ruling that they would never have given for another President. This is about PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT. We catch the other side SPYING on my campaign, the biggest political crime and scandal in U.S. history, and NOTHING HAPPENS. But despite this, I have done more than any President in history in first 3 1/2 years!"" Trump wrote in a series of posts on Twitter.

""Courts in the past have given 'broad deference'. BUT NOT ME!"" Trump added.

trump tweet

Mazars USA spokesperson Ian Duncan said in a statement that the firm was ""reviewing the decision in its entirety to fully understand our obligations.""

""As previously noted, Mazars USA fully intends to comply with its legal obligations,"" Duncan said.

In his dissent, Alito wrote that the majority's decision ""threatens to impair the functioning of the Presidency and provides no real protection against the use of the subpoena power by the Nation's 2,300+ local prosecutors.""

Thomas wrote in dissent that he agreed with the majority that presidents do not have absolute immunity from criminal subpoenas, but that he would have erased the lower court win for Vance and instructed the lower court to determine whether the subpoena should be blocked on the basis that it would interfere with Trump's duties.

The congressional cases involved subpoenas issued by Democratic-led committees of the House of Representatives, which sought financial records from Mazars as well as his banks, Capital One and Deutsche Bank. The committees said they needed the information to inform potential legislation, and as part of ongoing investigations.

""This case is different,"" Roberts wrote in the opinion, which was handed down shortly after the one in the New York case. ""Here the President's information is sought not by prosecutors or private parties in connection with a particular judicial proceeding, but by committees of Congress that have set forth broad legislative objectives.""

""Congress and the President—the two political branches established by the Constitution—have an ongoing relationship that the Framers intended to feature both rivalry and reciprocity,"" Roberts wrote.

The House Oversight Committee sought the information in connection with investigations into claims made by the president's former lawyer Michael Cohen that Trump inflated and deflated his assets to suit his needs.

The oversight panel is also investigating Trump's failure to list on his 2017 disclosure form $130,000 that he owed to Cohen to reimburse him for a hush money payment to the adult film actress Stormy Daniels. The Office of Government Ethics has said Trump should have listed the debt as a liability.

The financial services and intelligence committees issued two separate subpoenas to Deutsche Bank seeking information on the president and members of his family, including his children Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and Ivanka Trump. A third subpoena, from the financial services committee, asked Capital One for a wide variety of information on 15 Trump businesses.

The financial services committee is investigating potential foreign money laundering. Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the intelligence committee, has said his committee's investigation entails uncovering whether ""any foreign actor has sought to compromise or holds leverage, financial or otherwise, over Donald Trump, his family, his business, or his associates.""

Roberts wrote that the subpoenas raised grave concerns about the Constitution's separation of powers that the lower courts did not fully consider when they handed victories to Congress.

""Without limits on its subpoena powers, Congress could 'exert an imperious control' over the Executive Branch and aggrandize itself at the President's expense, just as the Framers feared,"" Roberts wrote. ""And a limitless subpoena power would transform the ""established practice"" of the political branches.""

Roberts wrote that the fact that the subpoenas were issued to third parties, rather than the president himself, and asked for personal documents, did not significantly diminish the constitutional hurdles.

""Congressional demands for the President's information present an interbranch conflict no matter where the information is held — it is, after all, the President's information,"" Roberts wrote. ""Were it otherwise, Congress could sidestep constitutional requirements any time a President's information is entrusted to a third party — as occurs with rapidly increasing frequency.""

He added that because the president ""is the only person who alone composes a branch of government,"" there is not always ""a clear line between his personal and official affairs.""

Thomas dissented, saying he would hold that Congress has no power to issue a subpoena related to potential legislation ""for private, nonofficial documents — whether they belong to the President or not.""

""Congress may be able to obtain these documents as part of an investigation of the President, but to do so, it must proceed under the impeachment power,"" Thomas wrote.

Alito said he wouldn't assume that such subpoenas are always unlawful, but that that they are ""inherently suspicious.""

He said he agreed that lower courts should have to more carefully weigh separation of powers concerns, but argued that the majority did not go far enough.

""Specifically, the House should provide a description of the type of legislation being considered, and while great specificity is not necessary, the description should be sufficient to permit a court to assess whether the particular records sought are of any special importance,"" Alito wrote.

Schiff said in a statement that the Supreme Court's ruling ""will serve to delay the Committee's investigation — and, given the risk of foreign influence over this President, such delay is dangerous.""

""But we remain confident that we will ultimately prevail. And in light of the President's tweets this morning, he appears to believe the same,"" Schiff said.

Erwin Chemerinsky, a leading legal scholar and the dean of Berkeley Law, said the immediate effect of the rulings was that it was ""unlikely that either will be resolved soon or provide access to President Trump's tax returns before the November election.""

""The longer term impact is to help provide accountability for the president,"" Chemerinsky said. ""If the Court had accepted President Trump's claim of broad immunity from subpoenas, it truly would have put the president above the law.""

The consolidated congressional cases are Trump v. Mazars, No. 19-715 and Trump v. Deutsche Bank, No. 19-760. The New York case is Trump v. Vance, No. 19-635.

im3crc	liberal	Trump: Americans Who Died in War Are ‘Losers’ and ‘Suckers’	"Trump’s understanding of concepts such as patriotism, service, and sacrifice has interested me since he expressed contempt for the war record of the late Senator John McCain, who spent more than five years as a prisoner of the North Vietnamese. “He’s not a war hero,” Trump said in 2015 while running for the Republican nomination for president. “I like people who weren’t captured.”

Read: John McCain’s death brought out the worst in the Trump administration

There was no precedent in American politics for the expression of this sort of contempt, but the performatively patriotic Trump did no damage to his candidacy by attacking McCain in this manner. Nor did he set his campaign back by attacking the parents of Humayun Khan, an Army captain who was killed in Iraq in 2004.

Trump remained fixated on McCain, one of the few prominent Republicans to continue criticizing him after he won the nomination. When McCain died, in August 2018, Trump told his senior staff, according to three sources with direct knowledge of this event, “We’re not going to support that loser’s funeral,” and he became furious, according to witnesses, when he saw flags lowered to half-staff. “What the fuck are we doing that for? Guy was a fucking loser,” the president told aides. Trump was not invited to McCain’s funeral. (These sources, and others quoted in this article, spoke on condition of anonymity. The White House did not return earlier calls for comment, but Alyssa Farah, a White House spokesperson, emailed me this statement shortly after this story was posted: “This report is false. President Trump holds the military in the highest regard. He’s demonstrated his commitment to them at every turn: delivering on his promise to give our troops a much needed pay raise, increasing military spending, signing critical veterans reforms, and supporting military spouses. This has no basis in fact.”)

Eliot A. Cohen: America’s generals must stand up to Trump

Trump’s understanding of heroism has not evolved since he became president. According to sources with knowledge of the president’s views, he seems to genuinely not understand why Americans treat former prisoners of war with respect. Nor does he understand why pilots who are shot down in combat are honored by the military. On at least two occasions since becoming president, according to three sources with direct knowledge of his views, Trump referred to former President George H. W. Bush as a “loser” for being shot down by the Japanese as a Navy pilot in World War II. (Bush escaped capture, but eight other men shot down during the same mission were caught, tortured, and executed by Japanese soldiers.)

When lashing out at critics, Trump often reaches for illogical and corrosive insults, and members of the Bush family have publicly opposed him. But his cynicism about service and heroism extends even to the World War I dead buried outside Paris—people who were killed more than a quarter century before he was born. Trump finds the notion of military service difficult to understand, and the idea of volunteering to serve especially incomprehensible. (The president did not serve in the military; he received a medical deferment from the draft during the Vietnam War because of the alleged presence of bone spurs in his feet. In the 1990s, Trump said his efforts to avoid contracting sexually transmitted diseases constituted his “personal Vietnam.”)"	left
lfifcf	liberal	Biden said Trump's handling of COVID-19 was 'even more dire than we thought' after finding insufficient vaccine supplies	"President Biden said that Trump's pandemic response was even worse than he had expected.

He said that since taking office he found there was much less vaccine available than claimed.

Biden made the comments in a wide-ranging interview with CBS News.

Visit the Business section of Insider for more stories.

President Joe Biden said that since taking office, he found that the Trump administration's handling of the COVID-19 crisis was even worse than he had believed it would be.

In a wide-ranging interview with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell, Biden spoke on the occasion of the Super Bowl, which was attended by around 25,000 socially-distanced fans as a precaution in the pandemic.

Asked by O'Donnell if next year's Super Bowl would have a full stadium, Biden said he hoped so, but also talked about the ""lost time"" in fighting the pandemic so far.

""It's my hope and expectation if we're able to put together and make up for all the lost time in fighting COVID that's occurred,"" he said.

Biden raised his dismay at the Trump administration after O'Donnell said her research team had estimated that it would take a year for enough people to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity.

CBS News based that estimate on comments made by infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci, who has served on both administrations' pandemic response teams.

Biden said that he had been handed a ""dire"" situation by the former administration.

""One of the disappointments was when we came into office is the circumstance relating to how the [former] administration was handling COVID was even more dire than we thought,"" Biden said.

""We thought that it had indicated there was a lot more vaccine available and it didn't turn out to be the case. So that's why we've ramped up every way we can.""

—CBS Evening News (@CBSEveningNews) February 7, 2021

He said he planned to use NFL stadiums for mass vaccinations to speed the process, but said that the availability of vaccines was holding things back.

""It was one thing if we had enough vaccine, which we didn't, so we're pushing as hard as we can to get more vaccines manufactured,"" he said.

The Biden administration also wants to launch a major pro-vaccination advertising blitz, but the project is on ice due to the low availability of doses, according to Politico.

The president said that he had already approached producers like Pfizer and Moderna to ask them to ramp up production, but said nonetheless achieving herd immunity before the end of summer would be ""very difficult.""

Biden did not hold back in his criticism of his predecessor during the interview, also saying that Trump should not be receving intelligence briefings — as it customary for former presidents — because of ""his erratic behavior unrelated to the insurrection.""

idaazo	liberal	Obama's Stinging Indictment of Trump at DNC: He Treats 'Presidency as One More Reality Show'	"There was a point when Barack Obama at least hoped that Donald Trump would try and approach his job as president “seriously.”

But as the former president made clear in a devastating critique of Trump’s time in office, even those hopes were too ambitious.

“This administration has shown it will tear our democracy down if that’s what it takes to win,” Obama said. “So we have to get busy building it up.”

Speaking from Philadelphia as part of the third night of the Democratic National Convention, Obama delivered both a brutal look at the damage of Trump’s presidency and a call to action to support Joe Biden, his former vice president, and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, as they try to help America recover from what the Democratic leader sees as the repeated attacks weakening the democratic principles of the country.

Trump, Obama said, has “no interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show that he can use to get the attention he craves.”

“Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job because he can’t,” Obama said, pointing to the nation’s death toll of more than 170,000 from the coronavirus pandemic. “And the consequences of that failure are severe.”

Obama noted that in these polarized times, many have already decided what they’ll do in November. And that’s when the former president briefly halted his fire at Trump, and the warmth Obama feels for Biden was clear as he painted a picture of how he believes Biden can heal the country from the divisiveness and turmoil that has dominated the Trump era.

He talked about Biden’s love for his kids, his empathy for the grieving parents of soldiers as a man who can relate to their struggles and sorrows, praising his resilience and strength.

“But more than anything, what I know about Joe and Kamala is that they actually care about every American,” Obama said. “And they care deeply about this democracy.”

Again and again Wednesday night, however, Obama made clear that his message was two-pronged, championing a man he believes will protect democracy while condemning the man who has helped weaken it.

“ They understand that political opponents aren’t un-American just because they disagree with you, that a free press isn’t the enemy but the way we hold officials accountable, that our ability to work together to solve big problems like a pandemic depends on a fidelity to facts and science and logic and not just making stuff up,” Obama said. “None of this should be controversial. These shouldn’t be Republican principles or Democratic principles. They’re American principles. But at this moment, this president and those who enable him have shown they don’t believe in these things.”

Obama made clear no one person can cure what ails the country, “not even a president.” And as Obama spoke,Trump tore into him on Twitter with an all caps conspiracy lie.

Minutes later, Trump went a step further, tweeting “WHY DID HE REFUSE TO ENDORSE SLOW JOE UNTIL IT WAS ALL OVER, AND EVEN THEN WAS VERY LATE? WHY DID HE TRY TO GET HIM NOT TO RUN?”

Obama said he could understand why immigrants to the country could have concerning questions, how the younger generation could look on in horror at the country’s politics as it descends into even worse rancor as Election Day approaches, seeing “the meanness and the lies and crazy conspiracy theories and think, what’s the point?”

“Well, here’s the point,” Obama said. “This president and those in power, those who benefit from keeping things the way they are, they are counting on your cynicism. They know they can’t win you over with their policies. So they’re hoping to make it as hard as possible for you to vote, and to convince you that your vote doesn’t matter. That’s how they win.”

And by accomplishing that trick, Obama said, “that’s how a democracy withers, until it’s no democracy at all.”

“We can’t let that happen,” Obama said. “Do not let them take away your power. Don’t let them take away your democracy.”"	left
m315dg	liberal	Trump's own Defense secretary says he was responsible for Capitol riot	"Former acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller says in a forthcoming interview that former President Trump Donald TrumpTrump's Facebook ban to stay in place, board rules Trump allies launching nonprofit focused on voter fraud DOJ asks for outside lawyer to review Giuliani evidence MORE's speech at a ""Stop the Steal"" rally on Jan. 6 was to blame for the deadly Capitol riot later that day.

“Would anybody have marched on the Capitol, and tried to overrun the Capitol, without the president’s speech? I think it’s pretty much definitive that wouldn’t have happened,” Miller said while speaking with Vice on Showtime.

Miller served as Trump's final Defense chief, filling the top Pentagon post from November until Trump left office in January. Miller previously headed up the National Counterterrorism Center last year.

The former Defense chief told Vice that he wasn’t sure whether Trump was aware of how consequential his speech would be, but said he believed there was a ""cause-and-effect"" relationship between the speech and riot.

“The question is, did he know he was enraging people to do that? I don’t know,"" Miller said.



Vice noted that Miller faced criticism of his own due to the delayed deployment of the National Guard to the Capitol after a mob of Trump's supporters had broken in on Jan. 6.

“It comes back to understanding how the military works — this isn’t a video game, it’s not Black Ops Call of Duty,” Miller said, rejecting the criticism.

A day before the Capitol attack, all 10 living former Defense secretaries released a letter advising Miller to ensure a peaceful transition of power, amid concerns that Trump would attempt to use the military to halt the transition process.

“There was a lot of concern that we were just some sort of Trump hatchet men coming in to do heinous things to the Department of Defense, which couldn’t be further from the truth,"" Miller said.

The former top Trump administration official noted that the political climate leading up to the riot was a ""constant drumbeat"" of claims about ""potential illegal, immoral, and unethical activities.""

During the speech Trump gave on the morning of Jan. 6, he incorrectly stated that the election had been stolen and that widespread voter fraud had occurred.

“We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” Trump said during the speech.

After his speech ended, pro-Trump rioters broke into the U.S. Capitol, causing lawmakers to flee or shelter in place. Five people died as a result of the riot, including one Capitol Police officer.

kr9jwa	liberal	Trump is repaying Pence's 4 years of unflinching loyalty by making him a scapegoat for his election loss	"President Donald Trump is urging Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election result when Congress meets to certify the Electoral College vote on January 6.

But here's the thing: Pence doesn't have the authority to unilaterally overturn or object to the result.

Trump has effectively set Pence up to be the fall guy for his election loss, as millions of the president's supporters reject President-elect Joe Biden's victory based on groundless assertions of mass voter fraud.

Pence's political ambitions, including a 2024 run, could take a major hit from all this.

The vice president has been extraordinarily loyal to Trump, and, in return, the president is throwing Pence under the bus.

Pence in a statement on Wednesday signaled that he would adhere to the Constitution and not take steps to overturn the election. Only hours later he was escorted from the Capitol as Trump supporters breached the building.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Vice President Mike Pence has been unflinchingly loyal to President Donald Trump throughout his tumultuous presidency — and Trump repaid Pence by throwing him under the bus with just two weeks left in office.

The president has in recent days falsely suggested that Pence can overturn the 2020 election results, saying at a rally in Georgia on Monday night, ""I hope Mike Pence comes through for us, I have to tell you.""

""Of course, if he doesn't come through, I won't like him quite as much,"" Trump added of his vice president.

Trump continued to put pressure on Pence during a speech before thousands of supporters on Wednesday. ""If Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election ... He has the absolute right to do it,"" Trump said.

But Pence does not have unilateral authority to do so, despite facing mounting pressure from Trump and his allies.

By suggesting otherwise, Trump is turning Pence into a scapegoat for his election loss.

In a tweet on Wednesday, Trump attacked Pence for not having the ""courage"" to adhere to the president's impossible request to overturn the election result.

This could cost the vice president, who is thought to have ambitions of running for president in 2024, support within Trump's base.

As vice president, it's Pence's job to preside over the certification of the Electoral College vote on January 6. But his role is largely ceremonial, and he's essentially supposed to read aloud the certificates of electoral votes from each state. He does not have a constitutional or legal pathway to singlehandedly upend President-elect Joe Biden's victory.

""Hope VP Pence understands that his Constitutional role tomorrow at U.S. Capitol is to be merely announcer, not decider,"" Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian, tweeted on Tuesday.

Or as Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor, put it: ""Pence has no power to 'come through' for Trump.""

Even Jay Sekulow, the attorney who defended Trump during his impeachment trial, said what the president has urged Pence to do would be unconstitutional.

And Pence himself has also echoed the view that he does not have the constitutional authority to acquiesce to Trump's call for him to reject the election results.

In a statement on Wednesday ahead of the certification process in Congress, Pence said, ""It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not.""

Pence's statement also referenced ""significant allegations of voting irregularities,"" alluding to Trump's groundless assertions of voter fraud. The vice president said he shared the concerns of ""millions of Americans about the integrity of this election."" His careful language in the statement was indicative of the precarious position Trump put the vice president in by demanding Pence do something he can't.

Trump sets Pence up to be the fall guy

After weeks of consistently and baselessly saying that he lost the 2020 presidential race because of mass voter fraud, Trump's latest falsehood puts his defeat in a free and fair election on Pence's shoulders.

""The Vice President has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors,"" Trump said in a Tuesday tweet.

Though there's no validity to the president's claims about Pence's authority to overturn the election, Trump supporters have seemingly been convinced otherwise. At the Georgia rally on Monday, voters chanted at Pence: ""Stop the steal!""

With his political aspirations always at the forefront of his mind, Pence until Wednesday had been vague about what he planned to do. It's likely that Pence still wants to appear loyal to the president and his millions of supporters, even as Trump effectively abandons him.

""I know we all — we all got our doubts about the last election. And I want to assure you, I share the concerns of millions of Americans about voting irregularities,"" Pence said at Monday's rally in Georgia. ""And I promise you, come this Wednesday, we'll have our day in Congress. We'll hear the objections. We'll hear the evidence.""

Trump's move to put all this fallout on Pence means the vice president is likely to be vilified by the president's supporters. Polling shows that Trump supporters overwhelmingly (and falsely) believe that Biden is not the legitimate winner of the 2020 election.

When Trump doesn't get what he wants from someone — even if it's impossible to deliver — they're inevitably targeted by the president and, in turn, his supporters. Pence is poised to face the same fate, despite his years of unrelenting fealty to Trump.

Even if Pence took some sort of symbolic stance against the certification on January 6, Biden will still be inaugurated on January 20. Republicans in both chambers have signaled plans to object to certification in certain states, which Pence has expressed support for, but this will only delay and not change the outcome.

No matter what, Trump has set Pence up for failure."	left

The big picture: The former first lady is one of the most popular and motivating figures across the ideological range of the Democratic Party, and is one of the most powerful voices for turning out women and voters of color. Her speech was recorded. While she reprised her 2016 mantra — ""When they go low, we go high"" — Obama was direct in her criticism of Trump.

""So let me be as honest and clear as I possibly can. Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country. He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head. He cannot meet this moment. He simply cannot be who we need him to be for us.

ha1ms2	liberal	Second Michigan poll shows Trump even farther behind, with Biden leading by 16 points	"Second Michigan poll shows Trump even farther behind, with Biden leading by 16 points

The damage done to President Donald Trump's standing in Michigan following recent protests outside the White House and in cities across the U.S. may have been even greater than originally believed, a new poll released to the Free Press said Tuesday.

Two weeks ago, EPIC-MRA of Lansing, a polling firm that does work for the Free Press, released a survey showing former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, leading Trump 53%-41% in Michigan, a 12-point edge.

But a second poll, started on May 31, a day after the first poll began, and concluded a day later than the first poll, on June 4, showed Biden leading Trump 55%-39% in Michigan, a 16-point margin. As it did for the first poll, EPIC-MRA surveyed 600 randomly selected likely voters for the second one, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

The second poll also showed:

The percentage of Michiganders surveyed who believe the country is headed in the wrong direction increased from 63% in the first survey to 70% in the second. The percentage who believe the U.S. is headed in the right direction fell from 30% to 22%.

The percentage of those with a negative view of Trump as president rose from 56% to 61%, as the percentage of those with a positive view fell from 42% to 38%.

While the same number, 51%, said they would vote to replace Trump in November, the percentage saying they would vote to reelect him fell, from 38% to 33%. The percentage of those saying they would consider voting for someone other than the president rose from 8% to 13%.

While it's not known for certain what caused the change, the second survey added a day of polling in the immediate aftermath of law enforcement and military personnel on June 1 forcefully clearing peaceful protesters from a public square outside the White House. They used pepper spray and smoke canisters to move the crowd so Trump could have his photo taken holding a Bible outside St. John's Church, which had been damaged in another protest.

More: With Bicden gaining in polls, Michigan's status as battleground state up in the air

""Things that happen in the news are what typically cause changes like this and the only thing you can point to that happened in the news was what happened on June 1,"" said Bernie Porn, pollster for EPIC-MRA. ""I attribute the dramatic slide to more saturation of that news coverage.""

Trump took widespread criticism for the photo op, as he did for other comments he made about using military forces in American cities to put down protests held in the wake of the death of George Floyd, an unarmed African American man who died after a police officer in Minneapolis held him to the ground with his knee on his neck for nearly 9 minutes. A recent USA Today poll showed the clearing of the square to be a defining moment for many Americans and a large majority putting more trust in the Black Lives Matter movement to promote justice and racial equality than Trump.

The new poll comes as questions are already beginning to be asked as to whether Trump, who won Michigan by a scant two-tenths of 1 percentage point over Hillary Clinton four years ago, can do so again and whether its status as a battleground state is up in the air.

The new poll was not commissioned by the Free Press.

EPIC-MRA conducted the second poll because several of its other clients, which include but are not limited to the news media, had commissioned too many questions for it to put in one survey. As part of the second survey, however, the polling firm still asked questions about the upcoming election and the mood of those surveyed regarding the president as it had in the first survey.

The second poll had the same breakdown of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (43%), Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (38%) and independents who say they don't typically lean toward either party (11%) as the first poll.

ghqtuz	liberal	‏ Donald Trump is 'glum' because 80,000 dead Americans is cutting into his own popularity	"The Washington Post brings us both stories, but the news that Trump is Sad, as ""deaths mount"" and as the Trump team abandons efforts to fight the virus to instead focus on ""reopening"" the country, is surely the more important news. The administration has not been able to orchestrate the sort of widespread testing that other nations are relying on to determine when they should reopen their own economies, so the answer is to not try. There is no contact tracing plan. There is no evidence that anyone has been able to drum into Trump's empty head even the most basic facts about the virus—no, it will not ""go away on its own""—or that Mike Pence or any of the other top Trump officials give a particular damn about trying.

And so Trump is sad. The Post reports that some of Trump's advisers ""described the president as glum and shell-shocked by his declining popularity"" and that ""in private conversations, he has struggled to process how his fortunes suddenly changed from believing he was on a glide path to reelection to realizing that he is losing"" in the polls to Biden. Truly, Dear Leader is having a moment here.

Oh—and we also learn that Dr. Deborah Birx is upset with the Centers of Disease Control for counting too many deaths. We learn that the administration's distribution of their new bet-everything-on-this wonder drug, remdesivir, is as botched as the rollout of the last one, with not even the task force being given a heads-up before the government shipped out supply of the drug to seven states before anyone apparently bothered to determine which states might most need it. We learn that Jared Fucking Kushner is inexplicably taking command of more bullshit he knows nothing about, and that not even Stephen Moore's only extended family is buying his calls for a little economy-boosting grandma murdering, and that everything remains chaotic, bungling, delusion-based and thoroughly incompetent.

But there is a plan. The new White House plan is that people are going to keep dying, and likely in larger numbers than even now, and Trump is somehow going to argue that that's fine. Or a victory. Or the price America must pay, to have someone as grand and as orange as Himself in charge of it. He's going to resume rallies and Americans are going to continue to die at the rate of 2,000 a day, likely rising higher in the next few weeks.

Is the public ""willing to accept that?"" frets an anonymous White House adviser to the Post. Yes, that is the real question here. Not whether it should be prevented, but whether the White House will be politically successful in selling it.

That has become the new Senate Republican plan too. In a separate Post story, we learn that Republicans are ""increasingly nervous"" they will lose the Senate majority as a result of, you know, their party's incompetence killing what could be, in November, anywhere from 100,000 (best case) to quarter million people (our new middle case, perhaps.)

But what if the economy recovers? Then perhaps killing a six-figure number of American civilians might turn out to be politically tolerable. Also, Republican senators plan to tout their support for the massive economic relief packages that they seem to presume are relief-ing far more Americans than so far have been the case. Also also, ""efforts to target China will continue throughout the campaign.""

It will be a stress test of just how far the Republican base has itself descended into xenophobic fascism, in other words. Is it all right that Dear Leader botched, absolutely, the most pivotal national disaster the nation has seen in a century? What if we claim it is the fault of foreigners? Is the giddy thrill of having an openly racist, boorish national shitposter as leader still so intoxicating that the base will stomach even people in their own neighborhoods dying in order to keep that intoxicating version of ""winning"" flowing through their veins?

Probably, as the white-nationalism heavy protests against pandemic safety demonstrate. But Republicans fret that their dreaded enemy, also known as absolutely everyone else in America, might have even stronger feelings about Trump killing large numbers of us. Can the party's digital operations nullify all those unpleasant cretins mumbling that maybe they didn't want the Spanish Flu combined with the Great Depression, no matter how much President Hairstyle insists on his victory? Will Republican donors continue to support the party's anti-competence, pro-catastrophe stance, if the party can sweeten the pot by promising to cut their taxes a wee bit more? The pundits will all be on edge.

In the meantime, Republicans are Sad nationwide, it seems, from the White House downward. Not because even after 80,000 deaths the arch-conservative Republican administration continues to not have even one damn clue as to how to stop Americans from dying in whatever proportions the virus wishes them to, but because it is cutting into their poll numbers.

It's very tragic. How very terrible, to live under such a constant feeling of dread and slow-moving disaster. The rest of us would be hard pressed to even imagine what that might be like."	left
hjxyzc	liberal	Trump flew into a rage every time US intelligence warned him about Russia, so officials gave up briefing him on it, report says	"President Donald Trump would blow up at briefers who tried to tell him about Russia's malign actions toward the US, CNN reported on Wednesday.

Former administration officials told CNN that this created a chilling effect, leading Trump to hear less and less about Russian threats and bolstering his belief that Russian President Vladimir Putin had good intentions.

Top security and intelligence officials denied that Trump resisted receiving intelligence about Russia. The White House did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

President Donald Trump was briefed less and less with warnings about Russia's behavior toward the US because he would get angry when presented with intelligence about it, CNN reported on Wednesday.

Early in Trump's presidency, officials learned to limit their verbal briefings on the topic and would often see their written materials ignored, former administration officials told CNN's Jim Sciutto.

""The president has created an environment that dissuades, if not prohibits, the mentioning of any intelligence that isn't favorable to Russia,"" a former senior national security staffer told CNN.

John Ratcliffe, the director of national intelligence, who started in May, and Robert O'Brien, the national security adviser, denied the accounts.

The claims have nonetheless have renewed the relevance of a New York Times report, published last week, that said Taliban-linked bounty killings sponsored by Russia targeted US troops.

Three separate Taliban sources corroborated these claims in a report by Mitch Prothero for Business Insider on Wednesday. The Associated Press reported on Monday that intelligence officials knew about them and had briefed the president on them as far back as 2019.

CNN's report on the president's attitude about intelligence briefings on Russia casts the issue in a new light.

Citing multiple former officials, CNN reported that at the start of his presidency, Trump often flew into a rage at briefers who attempted to tell him about hostile Russian activity toward the US, including political interference.

They soon learned not to highlight Russia in their briefings, according to the report.

In many cases, oral briefings on Russia would be avoided altogether and left in the president's lengthy written briefings, which he often did not read, CNN reported.

It left officials with difficult decisions about how to prioritize the most crucial information, CNN said. A former senior intelligence official said their policy became to ""save it for when it matters.""

This led to what a former senior National Security Council official described as ""a self-fulfilling prophecy"": The less Trump heard of Russian activity, the less he believed that President Vladimir Putin could mean the US harm.

Ratcliffe told CNN in a statement that this was ""totally false."" O'Brien told the outlet that the claims were ""ridiculous"" and that the intelligence had not been reliable enough to pass on to the president.

CNN's report is also in line with Trump's well-documented deference toward Putin despite warnings. As one former US ambassador to Russia put it in a tweet on Wednesday, Trump ""always sides with Putin.""

leq3vg	liberal	Majority of Americans say Trump should be convicted, barred from holding federal office in impeachment trial	"With his impeachment trial set to begin this week, a narrow majority of Americans say they support the Senate convicting former President Donald Trump and barring him from holding federal office again, according to a new ABC News/Ipsos poll released Sunday.

Compared to public attitudes in the early days of his first impeachment trial, support for the Senate convicting Trump is higher now. In an ABC News/Washington Post poll published in late January 2020, when the first trial was ongoing but before senators had voted, 47% of Americans said the Senate should vote to remove Trump from office and 49% said he should not be removed.

But in this latest poll, 56% of Americans say Trump should be convicted and barred from holding office again, and 43% say he should not be. The new poll was conducted by Ipsos in partnership with ABC News using Ipsos' KnowledgePanel.

Meanwhile, the attention on Capitol Hill last week focused more on the fate of a new Republican member of Congress who has faced backlash for espousing extremist views and support for the QAnon conspiracy theory in her past. That focus, which followed the deadly insurrection on the U.S. Capitol that Trump is accused of inciting, seems to have taken a toll on the public's perception of the party. By a 17-point margin, Americans say there are more radical extremists within the GOP than the Democratic Party.

On Jan. 13, Trump became the first president ever to be impeached by the House of Representatives twice, when a majority of the body's members voted in favor of charging Trump with ""incitement of insurrection"" for his role in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.

A key difference between this trial and the first is that Trump is no longer president and therefore cannot be removed from office. All but five Republican senators have gone on the record saying they think the trial is unconstitutional because of this fact. Still, Democrats have argued that failing to hold Trump accountable would signal to future presidents that they can evade punishment for their actions, as long as they come at the end of their term in office.

It would take 67 senators to vote to convict Trump, meaning 17 Republicans would need to be on board, assuming every member of the Democratic caucus votes to convict. If enough senators vote to convict, the chamber could hold a second vote on whether to bar him from holding federal office again. That would only take a simple majority.

A few Republican senators have said, or have reportedly said, that they think Trump committed an impeachable offense. Yet, none have said definitively that they will vote to convict the ex-president. But unlike the first impeachment, when no Republicans voted to impeach Trump in the House, 10 Republicans joined Democrats this time, including the chair of the House Republican Conference, Liz Cheney.

Support for conviction among Republicans was low in the latest ABC News/Ipsos poll, but slightly higher than it was ahead of Trump's first Senate impeachment trial. In the January 2020 ABC News/Washington Post poll, 9% of Republicans said the Senate should vote to remove Trump from office. In this new poll, 15% of Republicans say they support the Senate convicting and barring Trump from office.

Among Democrats, support for Trump's conviction is nearly universal in the ABC News/Ipsos poll, with 92% in favor. Independents mirror the full population, with 54% in support of the Senate convicting Trump and prohibiting him from holding office, and 45% against.

Although the Senate trial begins on Tuesday, freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, not Trump, is who captured lawmakers' attention in the lead up to it. The rebuke of the Republican's past extremist comments may have contributed to how Americans are viewing her party in the new ABC News/Ipsos poll.

Twenty-five percent of Americans say they think there are more radical extremists in the Democratic Party than in the Republican Party, but 42% of Americans say the opposite; another 32% say they think there are about the same amount of extremists within both political parties.

On Thursday, the House voted to strip the Georgia congresswoman of her new committee assignments after the Republican conference, under pressure from Democrats, did not, even though there was widespread condemnation within the conference for her past comments. The House vote was bipartisan, with 11 Republicans joining Democrats to boot Greene off the two committees.

The push to remove Greene from committees, in particular the House Education and Labor Committee, came after media outlets reported on Greene's conspiracy-ridden and sometimes violence-promoting social media activity before she ran for office. In one video, Greene questioned whether a plane flew into the Pentagon on 9/11, and in another she implied House Speaker Nancy Pelosi should be executed. She also falsely suggested that the Sandy Hook and Parkland mass school shootings were staged.

Arguing that committee assignments should be handled within their party's conference, Republicans also accused their colleagues across the aisle of failing to hold their own members similarly accountable.

""While I'll continue to be consistent in my condemnation of offensive comments and inappropriate actions, I'm patiently awaiting Speaker Pelosi's resolution to remove Congressman [Eric] Swalwell from the House Intelligence Committee over his ties to a suspected Chinese Spy and Congresswoman [Ilhan] Omar from the House Foreign Affairs Committee for her shameful anti-Semitic comments,"" Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., said in a statement about her vote to remove Greene from her committees.

In the ABC News/Ipsos poll, however, Republicans and Democrats don't view each other equally in terms of extremism within the parties.

Among Democrats, 8 in 10 said that there are more radical extremists in the Republican Party than in their party, and 13% said there are about equal numbers of extremists in both parties.

However, among Republicans, 33% said there are about the same number of extremists in both parties while 57% said there are more extremists in the Democratic Party.

This ABC News/Ipsos poll was conducted by Ipsos Public Affairs‘ KnowledgePanel® Feb. 5 to 6, 2021, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 508 adults. Results have a margin of sampling error of 4.8 points, including the design effect. Partisan divisions are 31%-26%-36%, Democrats-Republicans-independents.

hu7prb	liberal	The number of Americans who trust Biden to handle the pandemic better than Trump is increasing	"Back at the end of March, when the coronavirus was first surging in the United States, polls showed Americans felt similarly about both likely presidential candidates' abilities to handle the pandemic. Three months later, that's changed, a new survey released from The Washington Post and ABC News finds.

The poll, released Sunday, shows the presumptive Democratic nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden, holding a 20-point advantage over President Trump when it comes to which candidate voters trust more to deal with the pandemic. In March, the two were all but even, with Trump actually holding onto a slight advantage. The president is still seen as the better bet to manage the economy effectively, although his margin is shrinking there, as well.

NEW: Big swing in who Americans trust to handle the coronavirus: Biden now leads Trump by *20 points* 54-34

Overall, Biden has a 15-point lead over Trump among registered voters, up from a 10-point lead in May and a 2-point advantage in March. The Post notes that Trump's decline in support is concentrated in states that are experiencing larger coronavirus outbreaks at the moment, including Florida, Texas, Arizona, and Georgia.

hkiaer	liberal	Trump's advisers are concealing how badly he is performing in swing states to keep him happy, report says	"President Donald Trump's campaign officials are giving him misleading assurances about how well his reelection campaign is going, a Republican source told The New York Times.

Recent polls show Trump trailing in several swing states to Joe Biden, his presumptive Democratic challenger.

Trump has refused to tone down his rhetoric in response to his decline in the polls, and top aides are said to fear he is headed for defeat.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

President Donald Trump's campaign officials are misleading him with the idea he is doing better in his bid for reelection than he really is, a Republican official in frequent contact with the campaign told The New York Times.

The Republican, who spoke with The Times on the condition of anonymity, said some aides ""willfully distort the electoral landscape to mollify Mr. Trump.""

The official recalled a conversation in which aides assured Trump he was performing well in Maine, a swing state where in fact he has trailed the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, by double digits in polls.

The Trump campaign is said to be in turmoil with recent polls — including one Wednesday by CNBC and Change Research, showing Trump trailing Biden in several swing states as well as nationally.

Campaign officials, according to The Times, believe that behind the slide is the president's faltering response to the coronavirus crisis, the George Floyd-inspired anti-racism protests, and recent reports alleging that he refused to take action after being briefed by US intelligence that Russia was paying for attacks on US troops in Afghanistan.

It's not just campaign officials who are thought to be wary of delivering bad news or unwelcome information to the president.

CNN this week reported that intelligence officials were wary of providing briefings on Russian hostility toward the US because the president had no interest in hearing it and would react angrily to bad news.

In the wake of the protests sparked by Floyd's death in Minneapolis, Trump has refused moderate his message to appeal to independent voters, contradicting the advice of aides, NBC News reported, instead doubling down on racially divisive statements and tweets."	left
kzwbps	liberal	‘It was my pleasure to crush a white nationalist insurrection’: DC officer injured in Capitol riot speaks out	"(NBC News Philadelphia)

A Washington DC police officer who was crushed by a far-right mob during the insurrection at the US Capitol earlier this month has said that he would do it all again to protect US democracy.

“If it wasn’t my job I would’ve done that for free,” Officer Daniel Hodges said in an interview with NBC. “It was absolutely my pleasure to crush a white nationalist insurrection … We’ll do it as many times as it takes.""

On 6 January, Officer Hodges responded to a radio call for back-up as pro-Trump rioters breached the Capitol building during a joint session of Congress to certify the 2020 election results which the president has sought to overturn.

He reached the west side of the Capitol as the siege was underway. In a separate interview with ABC News, Officer Hodges explained how officers were spread across the Capitol after a police line was compromised.

He fell back inside the building and put on a gas mask. But as he reached a tunnel, he was surrounded by a mob who beat him as he was pinned inside a doorway.

“We were fighting with everything we had to push it back,” he told NBC. “I got pinned to the doorway, they ripped my mask off, stole my equipment, beat me up, sprayed me with everything.”

One man took the officer’s baton and beat him with it, while another jammed a thumb into his eye, Officer Hodges said.

“Once I got my mask off I was sucking down tear gas, pepper spray and all that stuff,” he said.

The FBI and Metropolitan Police Department have identified a suspect who “assaulted and used a clear police shield to pin” Officer Hodges, police announced on Friday.

A picture is emerging of the scale of the deadly violence at the Capitol from the widely shared footage of the insurrection captured by the rioters themselves along with accounts from police and lawmakers.

The House of Representatives impeached the president on Tuesday for inciting an insurrection. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has also opened an “immediate review” of the Capitol’s “security infrastructure, interagency processes and procedures, and command and control”.

Story continues

Prosecutors warned that “the insurrection is still in progress” as federal law enforcement prepares additional charges against a growing list of rioters.

The Justice Department (DOJ) has opened nearly 300 investigations into the Capitol violence, according to US Attorney for DC Michael Sherwin. As of Friday DOJ had opened 98 criminal cases, most of which involve felonies.

“The cognitive dissonance and the zealotry of these people is unreal,” Officer Hodges told NBC. “They were waving the thin blue line flag while telling us that we’re traitors and calling themselves patriots and then later on beating us with the flags.”

He said: ""I had one guy yelling at me, telling me, you know, he paid for my gear, for me to give it to him. We had alleged veterans telling us that they fought their country, that they would never hurt us, but at the same time they were there, hurting us.""

hsuosz	liberal	64% distrust Trump on coronavirus pandemic; approval declines as cases grow: POLL	"With COVID-19 cases soaring nationally, Americans by nearly a two to one margin distrust what President Donald Trump says about the pandemic, and six in 10 in a new ABC News/Washington Post poll disapprove of how he’s handling it, up steeply since the early days of the outbreak.

Just 38% in the national survey now approve of Trump’s response, down from 46% in late May and a narrow majority, 51%, in late March, a 13-point drop. Disapproval gained 15% in the same period, to 60%.

See PDF for full results, charts and tables.

Among Trump’s challenges is his credibility on the issue in this poll, produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates. Only 34% of Americans place a great deal or good amount of trust in what he says about COVID-19, while 64% trust him not so much or – in the case of nearly half the public – not at all.

There’s also a disconnect in terms of priorities, with Americans, by 63-33%, saying it’s more important to control the spread of the virus than to restart the economy, a goal Trump has stressed. That 30-point preference for controlling the spread has widened from 20 points in late May.

Concern about catching the disease, moreover, remains persistently high. Sixty-six percent are very or somewhat worried that they or someone in their immediate family might become infected, and an additional 5% of Americans now say this already has happened.

Masks

In terms of protective action, 79% say they wear a mask all or most of the time when they’re around other people outside their home. Fewer, 57%, say they do so all of the time without exception.

Trust in Trump – and political views more broadly – interact with this behavior. Among people who generally trust what the president says on the issue, 41% say they always wear a mask around other people. That jumps to 66% among those who generally don’t trust him.

In strictly partisan terms, 38% of Republicans and those who lean Republican report always wearing a mask when they’re near others outside their home; this nearly doubles, to 70%, among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents.

Among other factors, always wearing a mask also is associated with ideology (it’s 71% among liberals while 38% among very conservative adults); age (42% among 18- to 29-year-olds vs. 61% among those 30 and older); and race (about 20 points lower among whites than among Black or Hispanic people). It’s also 20 points lower in rural areas compared with cities.

Most strikingly, wearing a mask is associated with worry about becoming infected. Always wearing one ranges from 81% among people who are very worried about catching the virus to 22% among those who aren’t worried at all. That suggests that the barrier to mask wearing – widely urged by public health officials – isn’t a lack of confidence that they work, but the level of public doubt that the situation is threatening enough to warrant it.

Another potential factor – state orders to wear masks – shows a more modest effect. In states where such orders were in place as of Sunday, when interviewing for this survey began, 60% say they always wear masks, compared with 51% in states with no such orders.

A statistical analysis called regression, holding all available factors constant, finds that worry about catching the virus is by far the single strongest predictor of wearing a mask. Other factors include being conservative and living in a rural area, both negative predictors of mask-wearing; and, as positive predictors, age, education, strongly prioritizing controlling the spread of the virus, living in a state with a mask mandate, living in counties with higher per-capita cases and being female.

Worry

Being worried about catching the virus is associated with partisanship and ideology, and, perhaps surprisingly, is not strongly related to the number of cases in one’s state or county. Eighty percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are worried about becoming infected, compared with 50% of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents. The gap is similar between liberals and those who are very conservative, 82% vs. 48%, with moderates in between.

Worry also is higher among Hispanics (78%) and Black people (74%), compared with 61% among whites.

Worry about catching the virus tends to be lowest in counties with the fewest cases, or the least recent growth in cases, whether overall or per capita, in quartiles.

Trump

Approval of Trump’s handling of the situation, and trust in what he says about it, again are highly partisan. His approval rating for handling the pandemic is 79% among Republicans, but 39% among independents and a mere 4% among Democrats. Since late March, he’s lost 21 points in approval on the issue among Democrats, while losing 9 points among independents and Republicans alike.

Trump’s rating has lost 15 to 16 points since late March in the Midwest, South and West alike, while essentially unchanged in the Northeast, where he started lower. Notably, too, while he’s better-rated in rural areas – albeit just with 48% approval – he’s lost 23 points there, as well as 16 points in suburban areas and 9 points in urban centers.

In an especially wide gap, Trump’s performance wins approval from 78% of those who prioritize restarting the economy, while plummeting to 17% of those who say it’s more important to control the spread of the virus.

Indeed, in a regression, views on controlling the spread of the virus vs. restarting the economy are the single strongest independent predictor of views of Trump’s handling of the situation (with strong preference for controlling the spread negatively predicting his performance). The next strongest factors are being a Republican and a conservative, both associated with approval of Trump; and being worried about catching the coronavirus and being a Democrat, both negative predictors. Education and being a Black person also are significant negative predictors.

Trust in what the president says also is highly influenced by partisanship. It’s 71% among Republicans, lower than his typical overall approval ratings within the party, dropping to 30% among independents and 6% of Democrats. Among other factors, trust in the president is lowest, 24%, in the counties with the most COVID-19 cases per capita, though it’s not high in other counties, 37%.

mg0ol8	liberal	Dominion’s $1.6 billion lawsuit against Fox News could seriously hurt Fox	"Not long after last November’s election, and before all the votes were even counted, a bizarre conspiracy theory started spreading in the Trumpiest regions of social media. This false conspiracy theory spread throughout conservative media, stoked by close Trump allies and even by the former president himself. And it was repeatedly touted on Fox News.

The theory alleged that Dominion Voting Services, a company that supplies hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of voting machines and related services to more than two dozen states, was actually owned by a different company, Smartmatic, and that Smartmatic was formed in order to “fix elections” in Venezuela. As Trump’s early leads in several key states disappeared after more ballots were counted, the conspiracy theorists blamed Dominion, claiming that the company’s machines were somehow stealing votes from Trump and giving them to now-President Joe Biden.

None of this is true. Smartmatic does not own Dominion and, in fact, competes with Dominion for business. Neither company was formed to rig elections (although Smartmatic did supply voting machines for Venezuela’s 2004 election, independent audits determined that those machines were “very accurate”). And there’s no credible evidence that Dominion’s voting machines did anything other than accurately tally up the votes cast on those machines.

Indeed, after Dominion sued Sidney Powell, a lawyer close to Trump and a major popularizer of the conspiracy theory against Dominion, Powell’s lawyers argued that she should not be liable for defamation because the allegations against the voting machines company are so implausible that “reasonable people would not accept such statements as fact.”

But the outlandishness of the lies against Dominion did not stop Fox News from hosting guests that touted those lies — including Powell herself. It didn’t stop many of Fox’s hosts from spreading lies, either.

Read all about Dominion and Smartmatic voting companies and you’ll soon understand how pervasive this Democrat electoral fraud is, and why there’s no way in the world the 2020 Presidential election was either free or fair. #MAGA @realDonaldTrump #AmericaFirst #Dobbs https://t.co/H38VvuvSUQ — Lou Dobbs (@LouDobbs) November 14, 2020

Fox’s decision to broadcast these lies could prove very expensive for the conservative media company. On Friday, Dominion filed a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox, and this lawsuit mirrors a similar $2.7 billion case brought by Smartmatic. To put those numbers in perspective, the Fox Corporation is valued at about $23 billion. So the two voting companies are seeking nearly one-fifth of Fox’s total valuation.

Even if Fox loses these cases, it’s far from clear that it will be ordered to pay billions of dollars. But the recently filed complaint in US Dominion v. Fox News Network lays out an unusually strong defamation claim.

As the Supreme Court held in New York Times v. Sullivan (1964), when a defendant is accused of making false claims about a public figure regarding a matter of public concern, that defendant cannot be held liable unless they made that false statement “with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.”

But Dominion’s lawyers lay out considerable evidence that some of Fox’s top executives, editors, and hosts knew that they were doing so but did it anyway. That’s the kind of behavior that can get a media company in deep trouble, even under the very strong First Amendment protections laid out in New York Times v. Sullivan.

Responding to the Dominion suit, Fox News Media issued this statement: “FOX News Media is proud of our 2020 election coverage, which stands in the highest tradition of American journalism, and will vigorously defend against this baseless lawsuit in court.” Fox has not had enough time to formally respond to Dominion’s legal complaint, so we don’t yet know for sure how it will defend itself against the evidence presented in the Dominion complaint. But in the lawsuit filed by Smartmatic, Fox made the bold argument that it should be permitted to broadcast allegations against that company because those allegations were “objectively newsworthy.”

The Smartmatic case, however, was filed in New York state courts, and Fox’s lawyers rely heavily on decisions by New York courts in laying out their argument. The Dominion case was filed in Delaware.

This case against Fox is only one part of a larger litigation strategy seeking to clear Dominion’s name — or, at the very least, secure compensation for the damage many Trump supporters have done to Dominion’s reputation. The company has also sued Powell, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, another popularizer of the conspiracy theory. And it’s warned other conservative news outlets, including Newsmax and One America News, that additional suits may be coming.

The allegations against Fox

The complaint in the Dominion lawsuit is 137 pages long, and a significant portion is devoted to quotes from Fox personalities and regular guests who touted the conspiracy theory against Dominion.

On November 8, for example, shortly after Joe Biden was declared the winner of the 2020 election, Fox host Maria Bartiromo interviewed Sidney Powell.

“Sidney, we talked about the Dominion software. I know that there were voting irregularities,” Bartiromo said to Powell. Powell then claimed that Dominion’s software was “flipping votes in the computer system, or adding votes that did not exist.”

Similarly, in a November 16 appearance with then-Fox Business host Lou Dobbs, Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel falsely claimed that “we had a situation in Michigan where one county had a 6,000-vote flip from Biden to Trump because of this Dominion voting machine.”

In a third segment — and, again, Fox featured many segments that promoted false or unproven statements about Dominion; I’m just going to describe three of them here for the sake of brevity — Fox host Jeanine Pirro touted a claim, which she attributed to “the president’s lawyers,” that Dominion is an “organized criminal enterprise” that was “started in Venezuela with Cuban money” and that it uses software that “is capable of flipping votes.”

Under New York Times v. Sullivan, the mere fact that Fox hosts and guests made these and similar statements is not enough for Dominion to prevail in its suit. Again, to overcome the bar to defamation suits laid out in that case, Dominion needs to show that Fox made a false claim “with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.”

But that brings us to the other half of Dominion’s case against Fox.

Dominion’s complaint lays out numerous times when it contacted Fox News to inform them that the network was not telling the truth. Dominion claims that it “had a direct conversation with Fox News President and Executive Editor Jay Wallace during which Dominion detailed Fox’s defamatory falsehoods about Dominion and explained how and why they are false.” It also points to several “SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT” emails that it sent to Fox employees, and to two letters to Fox that formally demanded the network retract its statements.

Fox, moreover, did not simply need to take Dominion’s word. High-ranking government officials, including then-Attorney General Bill Barr and then-Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Chris Krebs, made public statements that, in Barr’s words, there’s no evidence of “fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election” — though these statements spoke generally about the absence of fraud in the 2020 election and not specifically about Dominion.

And key figures within Fox appeared to be perfectly aware that there was no significant fraud in the election. One reason the claims against Dominion took hold is that many Trump voters saw Trump’s early leads in several states evaporate as additional ballots were counted. But Arnon Mishkin, director of Fox’s decision desk, warned months before the election that “on election night, we may be looking at states where it seems that President Trump is in the lead, but there’s still 20 or 30 percent of the vote outstanding.”

Mishkin (along with many election observers) understood that Biden voters were more likely to vote by mail than Trump voters, and, in many states, mailed ballots would be counted after in-person ballots.

Similarly, the Dominion complaint points to several instances where Fox hosts correctly stated that allegations of voter fraud in 2020 are false or overblown. In a November 19 column adapted from one of his show’s opening monologues, for example, Fox host Tucker Carlson wrote that Powell has “never demonstrated that a single actual vote was moved illegitimately by software from one candidate to another. Not one.”

In fairness, the fact that at least some Fox personalities contradicted the lies about Dominion could potentially reduce the amount of damages that Dominion is able to collect from Fox, because true statements will tend to reduce the impact of the lies. But true statements such as Carlson’s also suggest that Fox knew the allegations against Dominion are false.

It appears, in other words, that Fox didn’t simply behave recklessly when it spread lies about voting machines rigging the election for Biden. Rather, key figures within Fox were perfectly aware that these claims are lies. And yet the network touted them anyway.

How much could this wind up costing Fox?

The general rule is that a defendant who commits defamation is liable for any financial damages caused by a defamatory statement. If your uncle is about to give you a $5,000 gift, but then your brother tells him a lie that so enrages the uncle that he cancels the gift, then your brother would owe you $5,000 in a defamation suit.

Dominion points to some relatively small expenses that it’s incurred due to the conspiracy theories against it. It says that it “spent more than $600,000 on private security for the protection of its people” after its employees started receiving death threats. It also claims that it’s spent about $700,000 on a PR campaign “to mitigate the harm to its business.”

The biggest issue, however, is that Dominion could lose valuable contracts — either because Republican state officials will believe the lies about the company and refuse to do business with them, or because state officials who do not believe the lies will nonetheless choose not to do business with Dominion for fear of triggering a backlash among voters who do believe the conspiracy theories.

Dominion says that its contracts with state and local governments “are typically multi-year contracts and range from tens of thousands of dollars to over a hundred million dollars,” and it claims that it’s already losing business because of the smear campaign against it. An Ohio county commission, for example, voted to reject a $6.45 million contract with Dominion.

Overall, Dominion’s “current projections show lost profits of over $600 million over the next eight years”; the company also claims that “the viral disinformation campaign has irreparably damaged Dominion and destroyed the enterprise value of a business that was worth potentially more than $1 billion.”

It remains to be seen whether these catastrophic losses actually play out, but Dominion’s suggestion that the smear campaign against it could have ruined the company is, at the very least, plausible. Even fully rational election officials, who are completely aware that the lies about Dominion are in fact lies, may be reluctant to deal with the legions of Republican voters who could rise up in anger if a state or local government signs a contract with Dominion.

So Fox, in other words, could be in for a world of hurt."	left
mc9nnv	liberal	"McConnell claims ""states are not engaging in trying to suppress voters"". Mitch you’re such a jokester"	"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) claimed during a hearing Wednesday that Democrats' signature voting rights bill, the ""For the People Act,"" is unnecessary because ""states are not engaging in trying to suppress voters whatsoever.""

Reality check: Republican lawmakers across the country are trying to pass measures to make it more difficult to vote by limiting mail-in ballots, implementing new voter ID requirements and slashing registration options.

""There are at least 165 proposals under consideration in 33 states so far this year to restrict future voting access,"" Axios' Russell Contreras and Stef Kight wrote in February.

In South Carolina, a proposal would require signature matching for absentee ballots. A New Hampshire proposal would allow anyone to observe polls ""without obstruction."" A Texas plan would require that the Department of Public Safety verify voters' citizenship.

""Some of these voter suppression laws in Georgia and other Republican states smack of Jim Crow rearing its ugly head once again,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) claimed ahead of McConnell's comments.

The big picture: McConnell and Schumer both made rare appearances at a hearing of the Senate Rules Committee, which is examining the Democratic proposal to expand voter registration (e.g., automatic and same-day registration) and voting access (e.g., vote by mail and early voting).

The For the People Act would require states to establish independent redistricting commissions to carry out congressional redistricting to eliminate partisan gerrymandering.

It would also expand the prohibition on campaign spending by foreign nationals, require additional campaign finance disclosures, force presidential and vice presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns, reform the Federal Election Commission, and more.

Between the lines: Protection of voting rights is one of the key issues that Democrats have said warrants getting rid of the 60-vote filibuster if Republicans insist on blocking the legislation.

What he's saying: ""States are not engaged in trying to suppress voters whatsoever,"" McConnell said."	left
licvi9	liberal	Melania Trump disengaged from her husband's second impeachment trial and bitter over Jill Biden's publicity	"(CNN) While former President Donald Trump watches his second impeachment trial unfold , Melania Trump spends most of her time post-White House relaxing at the spa and staying out of the fray.

Though she has been checking in on the trial, says one source familiar with her interest level, the former first lady has mentally all but left Washington behind, unlike her husband.

According to multiple people who spoke to CNN about Trump's life in the weeks since she departed the nation's capital, her daily schedule has nothing to do with politics, Congress, trials or stymied social media accounts.

""She goes to the spa, has lunch, goes to the spa (again) and has dinner with Donald on the patio,"" said one person familiar with Melania Trump's schedule at Mar-a-Lago, her home in Palm Beach, Florida. ""Rinse and repeat. Every day.""

Another person familiar with her daily routine confirms Trump's affinity for the private club's spa facilities, noting it is not unusual for her to spend several hours a day there, enjoying the benefits at her disposal, often going twice in a 24-hour period, for massages, nail care, facial treatments or other items on the menu.

""She almost always does dinner,"" said a third person who has seen Trump outside of the spa. She spends her evenings on the outdoor patio of Mar-a-Lago, where she prefers fish for an entrée, according to the source, and is often joined at the table by her parents, Viktor and Amalija Knavs, who reside in a private suite of rooms at Mar-a-Lago for much of the year.

Though she is now a former first lady of the United States, her daily routine has not seen a significant change.

""It's pretty much the same as it was before (she was first lady) or even when she would come down during vacations,"" said the source familiar with Trump's schedule, noting there is not much evidence to delineate pre- and post-White House activities or work.

Melania Trump's office did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.

Trump is in the midst of setting up an official office and has hired three former employees from her East Wing staff in the hopes of resurrecting her Be Best campaign of helping children, continuing her ""work,"" as she calls it to friends.

Moments of bitterness

Yet there have been moments of bitterness and regret, say several people with knowledge of Trump's conversations of late, most notably since Joe Biden's inauguration and with respect to the activities of her successor, Jill Biden.

When Trump left Washington, she had the worst favorability ratings of any modern first lady upon departure from the White House, according to polling conducted by SSRS for CNN

At one time, early in her tenure, that wasn't the case -- Melania Trump was the most-liked member of the Trump family and the broader administration. But it's possible that Donald Trump's incendiary style, even though not necessarily something his wife condoned, had the residual effect of chipping away at the first lady's popularity. After the January 6 attack on the Capitol, Melania Trump did not make a statement denouncing the violence for five days.

""She could see how it was going to go for her,"" said one former White House official who spoke to CNN, noting that Trump felt she was in a lose-lose predicament whether she spoke publicly or not. If she condemned the violence, her husband and his base would be angered and it would create a stir about her breaking with the President. And by staying silent, she was implying support for what happened.

""Once (the insurrection) happened, she knew there was nothing to gain for her by speaking out or doing something -- so she didn't do anything,"" the former White House official said.

Two members of the first lady's staff resigned shortly after the deadly insurrection in protest of the administration's seeming acquiescence.

Trump, according to a person familiar with her schedule, had planned on going to Biden's inauguration and learned she would not be attending when her husband tweeted he would not go.

Disappointed by the way she left Washington, she has been ""bitter and chilly"" at times toward her husband, upset that her image became collateral damage in his quest to denounce the election and procure a peaceful transfer of power, two of the people familiar with her thinking of late note.

But Trump's most fervent ire has come from watching Jill Biden kick off her East Wing tenure on nearly the antithesis of the path Trump took. Biden moved into the White House right away, for starters, and had a staff hired and fleshed out within two weeks of the inauguration. Trump, meanwhile, remained in New York for the first five months of the administration, ostensibly to let son Barron finish up the school year; she never had more than 12 people on her White House staff, at times there were as few as seven. (Jill Biden already has nearly a dozen full-time staff members and is expected to add more.)

Though Melania Trump reportedly left a note of welcome for Biden in the Executive Residence, she has still not spoken to her, eschewing a long-held tradition of first ladies.

Trump has also taken note of the publicity her successor has garnered.

Within weeks of becoming first lady, Biden has done an interview with People magazine, gracing the cover with her husband, the new President, and was featured in Parents magazine, where she discussed her empathy for families dealing with homeschooling their children during the pandemic. The Bidens also appeared in a televised message that aired prior to last Sunday's Super Bowl.

Jill Biden has held at least seven events or speaking engagements since becoming first lady, on topics including military families, cancer prevention, health care, community college education and support for teachers. Prior to leaving Washington on January 20, Melania Trump had not been seen publicly for three weeks and had not held a solo public event for six weeks -- a schedule not entirely uncommon for the former first lady, who opted to maintain a less robust calendar, her staff said, to provide more focus on being a wife and mother.

Publicity

The attention Biden has been getting has not gone unnoticed by Trump, say those who know her. Though she is lamenting the media focus on her successor, Trump turned down several similar offers from national publications throughout her time as first lady, according to two people who worked closely with her. When presented with offers and asks for participation, it was Trump who would not want to do them.

In four years, she never did an interview with a national publication.

""Donald was more upset about Melania not getting magazine covers than Melania was,"" said Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who served as Trump's senior adviser during her first several months as first lady before the relationship went south.

On Christmas Day, then-President Trump retweeted a conservative media outlet's tweet pointing out the lack of magazine covers, citing ""elitist snobs in the fashion press."" Trump called his wife, ""The greatest of all time.""

Laura Bush was featured on at least six magazines during her two terms as first lady and Michelle Obama more than twice that.

Wolkoff told CNN it was not that the country wasn't interested in reading about Trump, it was that the fiercely private first lady was not interested in allowing the public to get to know her.

""Melania intentionally didn't do press as a defense mechanism,"" said Wolkoff, who wrote about her experiences with Trump in her book, ""Melania & Me: The Rise and Fall of My Friendship with the First Lady."" ""She and I would always discuss this reasoning and that's why everything was choreographed or emailed, or be 'approved' quotes or statements that I would often write.""

The lack of interest in sitting for an interview, out of privacy and concern for what might be asked and require an answer, was for Trump a paramount strategy, according to Wolkoff. Now Trump, according to multiple people familiar with her thinking, is second-guessing that tactic.

But the former first lady is not blaming herself in hindsight, she's blaming others -- former staff members, magazine editors, and corporations and foundations that opted not to work with her because of the former President's political rhetoric. Trump has recently been noting to acquaintances that she thinks she could have participated in more media opportunities and policy events had her staff been more accommodating to her needs.

""That seems unfair, but typical to blame everyone else,"" said someone familiar with Trump's thinking during her White House years. ""Everyone knows Melania Trump does what she wants when she wants, and not one staffer on her team could have done anything to change that."""	left
lppfp9	liberal	Dominion sues MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell for $1.3 billion, claiming he profited from election conspiracies	"MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell waits outside the West Wing of the White House before entering on January 15, 2021 in Washington, DC.

Dominion Voting Systems sued MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell on Monday, accusing the staunch ally of former President Donald Trump of pushing false conspiracies about the 2020 election ""because the lie sells pillows.""

The $1.3 billion defamation suit says Lindell knew his repeated claims about the election being ""stolen"" were not backed by evidence, but kept at it anyway to spur Trump's supporters to buy MyPillow products.

""MyPillow's defamatory marketing campaign—with promo codes like 'FightforTrump,' '45,' 'Proof,' and 'QAnon'—has increased MyPillow sales by 30-40% and continues duping people into redirecting their election-lie outrage into pillow purchases,"" Dominion's lawsuit says.

The 115-page complaint filed in Washington, D.C., federal court cites numerous statements Lindell made about Dominion in television interviews and social media posts, as well as in a two-hour documentary-style film that aired on conservative media in February.

Dominion legal counsel Megan Meier in a statement called Lindell's claims ""absolute nonsense"" that ""cannot be reconciled with any level of logic or truth.""

""But unfortunately, countless people actually believed it and sent MyPillow some of their hard-earned money as a result,"" Meier said.

The lawsuit accuses Lindell and MyPillow of defamation and deceptive trade practices.

In a phone interview with CNBC, Lindell said, ""I'm very happy that they finally got that suit filed.""

""My message to Dominion is thank you for finally getting this done, because it'll be back in the limelight now,"" Lindell said.

Lindell also disputed Dominion's claim that his company had profited from his efforts.

""They also say that I benefited, or that my I used this for MyPillow, to advertise, and that's not true. I lost 22 retailers,"" Lindell said. ""It's been cancel culture for MyPillow.""

In a video conference with reporters later Monday morning, Dominion said that Lindell's claim that his business has suffered as a result of his focus on the election contradicts his own prior statements.

The company also doubted that Lindell actually believes his claims about election fraud and Dominion.

""He's not the guy from the infomercials,"" Meier said during the conference. We're talking about a former professional card counter ... he knows what he's doing.""

MyPillow's advertisements, many of which prominently feature Lindell himself, air frequently on Fox News, a channel Trump was known to watch regularly as president. Lindell visited Trump at the White House on multiple occasions, including in the days before Trump left office, when Lindell was photographed carrying notes that made reference to martial law.

Trump, after his loss to President Joe Biden, refused to concede the race and spread an array of unfounded conspiracies alleging widespread voter fraud. His campaign and other allies filed dozens of lawsuits aimed at overturning the election results in key states, most of which were dismissed and none of which succeeded in invalidating enough votes to affect the outcome.

Lindell himself ""helped disseminate the Big Lie"" that the election was stolen, the lawsuit says, by spreading the ""fable"" that Dominion's algorithms had been ""programmed to steal votes from Trump.""

In his feature-length video claiming ""absolute proof"" of election theft, Lindell asserted that that fraud had only been discovered because Trump's lead on election night was so massive that the ""machines broke.""

Dominion's lawsuit says Lindell was ""repeating his defamatory falsehoods even though he knew Dominion employees were receiving death threats because of them.""

The suit against Lindell is only the latest effort by Dominion to seek redress for the ""enormous harm"" caused by the ""viral disinformation campaign"" against the voting company, whose systems were used in some areas of the U.S. during the presidential election.

Last month, Dominion sued Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, accusing him of proliferating similar conspiracies about the company in order to ""financially enrich himself.""

Giuliani had called that lawsuit, which also seeks more than $1.3 billion in punitive and compensatory damages, an ""act of intimidation by the hate-filled left-wing to wipe out and censor the exercise of free speech, as well as the ability of lawyers to defend their clients vigorously.""

Smartmatic, another elections equipment company targeted amid a flurry of conspiracies in the wake of Biden's victory, filed its own multibillion-dollar defamation suit in early February against the owner of Fox News.

Fox has filed a motion to dismiss that lawsuit."	left

kwes45	liberal	Rudy Giuliani says his 'trial by combat' comment during Trump's January 6 rally was a 'Game of Thrones' reference, not a call to violence	"President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani told The Hill on Tuesday that he was making a ""Game of Thrones"" reference when he told a crowd at Trump's January 6 ""Save America"" rally that ""we will have a trial by combat.""

""I was referencing the kind of trial that took place for Tyrion in that very famous documentary about fictitious medieval England,"" Giuliani told the reporter Brett Samuels. ""When Tyrion, who is a very small man, is accused of murder. He didn't commit murder, he can't defend himself, and he hires a champion to defend him.""

Giuliani insisted the comment ""incited no violent response from the crowd.""

The New York State Bar Association has opened up an inquiry into whether Giuliani should be disbarred after the rally.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Nearly a week after calling for ""trial by combat"" at the Washington, DC, rally that directly preceded the riot at the US Capitol, Rudy Giuliani says he was just making a ""Game of Thrones"" reference and not calling for a violent battle.

Giuliani, the personal attorney of President Donald Trump, was among several people including Trump and Donald Trump Jr. who spoke in front of hundreds of protesters outside the White House on the afternoon of January 6 as part of the ""Save America"" rally.

Trump overtly encouraged attendees at the rally to march to the Capitol, which many of them did in what turned into a deadly riot. At least five people, including a police officer, died in connection to the insurrection.

At the rally, Giuliani repeated baseless claims about election fraud and told the audience: ""If we are wrong, we will be made fools of, but if we're right, a lot of them will go to jail. So let's have trial by combat.""

Speaking with The Hill on Tuesday, Giuliani told the reporter Brett Samuels that he was just making a ""Game of Thrones"" reference.

""I was referencing the kind of trial that took place for Tyrion in that very famous documentary about fictitious medieval England,"" Giuliani told Samuels. ""When Tyrion, who is a very small man, is accused of murder. He didn't commit murder, he can't defend himself, and he hires a champion to defend him.""

It's unclear who Giuliani is referring to as the Tyrion in this story.

Giuliani went on to say he was actually referring to a ""trial between machines,"" an allusion to the legal battles Trump had waged against Dominion Voting Systems. The president, along with Giuliani and the lawyer Sidney Powell, has often baselessly claimed that the voting machines were rigged against him.

""I'm talking about trial between machines,"" he continued. ""In fact, you'll see it comes up exactly in the context of I challenge them to allow us to examine their machines. And then I say the consequences of the trial by combat will be if they prove that we're wrong, we'll be exceedingly embraced — we'll be disgraced. If we prove that they're wrong, they go to jail.""

Giuliani went on to say his trial-by-combat comment was not a call to violence.

""It incited no violent response from the crowd,"" he told Samuels. ""None. The crowd didn't jump up saying, 'Lock him up, throw him to jail, go to hell.' I've had speeches where people jump up and say, 'lock him up.' It was not an emotional — it was not an emotion-inspiring part of the speech.""

Just an hour after Giuliani spoke, and Trump encouraged the crowd to ""walk down to the Capitol"" to ""cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them,"" a mob of the president's supporters forced their way into the Capitol, where Congress was in session.

""You'll never take back our country with weakness,"" Trump told the crowd. ""You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.""

During his interview with The Hill, Giuliani repeated claims that the election was fraudulent and said the president bore ""no responsibility"" for the Capitol insurrection. He also baselessly claimed the Capitol breach was led by leftists impersonating Trump supporters and criticized House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy for saying otherwise.

Axios had reported earlier that McCarthy told Trump during a heated call on Monday that the mob consisted not of antifa but of ""MAGA"" supporters, a reference to Trump's Make America Great Again slogan. ""I know,"" he continued, ""I was there.""

""Kevin McCarthy doesn't know what the hell he's talking about,"" Giuliani told The Hill. ""He doesn't investigate. He's part of the Washington establishment. They make up the truth and they repeat it to each other. You think they ever bother to investigate?""

Emails to both Giuliani and McCarthy were not immediately returned.

Giuliani may be disbarred over his involvement in the insurrection

Though Giuliani argues his statements weren't meant to rile the mob, several institutions have distanced themselves from him in recent days.

The New York State Bar Association has opened up an inquiry into whether Giuliani should be disbarred. The bylaws of the association say ""no person who advocates the overthrow of the government of the United States, or of any state, territory or possession thereof, or of any political subdivision therein, by force or other illegal means, shall be a member of the Association.""

Several members of Congress, including Reps. Mondaire Jones and Ted Lieu, sent a letter to the association urging it to disbar the former New York City mayor.

On Wednesday, Middlebury College announced it was revoking Giuliani's honorary degree over what it described as his role in ""fomenting the violent uprising against our nation's Capitol."""	left
ktf14q	liberal	Twitter permanently bans Trump	"Twitter permanently banned President Donald Trump on Friday, days after a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol leaving five dead.

“After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence,” Twitter said in a statement Friday.

After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence.https://t.co/CBpE1I6j8Y — Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) January 8, 2021

The ban comes after the president incited a mob that broke into the US Capitol building, disrupting Congress’ certification of Joe Biden as the President Elect. Twitter initially put a 12-hour ban on Trump’s account for “repeated and severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy” after he posted messages repeating lies that the election was stolen.

At the time, Twitter said Trump would be banned permanently if he continued to violate its rules, including those around civic integrity or violent threats. Twitter said in a statement Friday that two new tweets posted since Trump’s initial suspension violated the platform’s rules, prompting the permanent suspension.

“Due to the ongoing tensions in the United States, and an uptick in the global conversation in regards to the people who violently stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, these two Tweets must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President’s statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence, as well as in the context of the pattern of behavior from this account in recent weeks,” Twitter said in its Friday blog.

Twitter decided the new tweets were “highly likely to encourage and inspire people to replicate the criminal acts” at the Capitol, and shared its reasoning in five parts:

President Trump’s statement that he will not be attending the Inauguration is being received by a number of his supporters as further confirmation that the election was not legitimate and is seen as him disavowing his previous claim made via two Tweets (1, 2) by his Deputy Chief of Staff, Dan Scavino, that there would be an “orderly transition” on January 20th. The second Tweet may also serve as encouragement to those potentially considering violent acts that the Inauguration would be a “safe” target, as he will not be attending. The use of the words “American Patriots” to describe some of his supporters is also being interpreted as support for those committing violent acts at the US Capitol. The mention of his supporters having a “GIANT VOICE long into the future” and that “They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!” is being interpreted as further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an “orderly transition” and instead that he plans to continue to support, empower, and shield those who believe he won the election. Plans for future armed protests have already begun proliferating on and off-Twitter, including a proposed secondary attack on the US Capitol and state capitol buildings on January 17, 2021.

Twitter declined to comment on other Trump-related accounts like @POTUS when questioned by The Verge. If Trump attempted to circumvent this ban by using a separate account, that account would be permanently suspended “at first detection,” according to Twitter. If a government account, like @POTUS, was used to evade @realDonaldTrump’s ban, Twitter said that it would try to limit the account’s use but would not suspend it unless it was necessary to curb real-world violence.

Earlier Friday, more than 300 Twitter employees signed onto an internal petition calling for Trump to be permanently banned following the January 6th Capitol riots.

“We must examine Twitter’s complicity in what President-Elect Biden has rightly termed insurrection. Those acts jeopardize the wellbeing of the United States, our company, and our employees,” the employees wrote in the letter.

On Thursday, Facebook put an “indefinite” ban on Trump that it said would last at least through Inauguration Day. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the risks “are simply too great” to allow Trump continued access after he used the platform to “incite violent insurrection against a democratically elected government.”

The suspension has been a long time coming. For years, Twitter has faced pressure to remove Trump from its platform due to the large megaphone it’s offered him to spread hateful language and lies. The company justified his continued presence on the platform as being in the public interest.

President Donald Trump's official Twitter account, @realDonaldTrump, is being served up as a result for searches on the social media site for ""racist.""

On Friday, some Twitter users pointed out that the president's Twitter account was listed under the People tab for searches for ""racist."" Multiple CNET staff saw the same result, when signed out of an account and using a private web browser mode. Many of the accounts that showed up in the search results under the People tab had the words ""racist"" or ""racism"" in the Twitter name or bios.

A Twitter spokeswoman said if users mention an account alongside certain terms, the account and the keywords can become algorithmically surfaced together as a search recommendation. A search on Twitter shows that users have been mentioning Trump's account with the word ""racist.""

CNET

Trump has been locked in a battle with Twitter and other social media sites. Last week, the president signed an executive order that aims to curtail legal protections that shield Facebook, Twitter and other online companies from liability for content posted by their users. On Tuesday, the Center for Democracy and Technology sued Trump, alleging that the order violates the First Amendment and is a retaliatory move against Twitter.

The executive order came after Twitter added fact-checking labels to two tweets in which Trump claimed that mail-in election ballots would be ""fraudulent."" Clicking on Twitter's ""Get the facts"" label brings you to a page with tweets from news outlets that say mail-in ballots are rarely linked to voter fraud and that Trump's claims are ""unsubstantiated.""

Twitter also veiled a tweet from the president about protests in Minnesota, putting it behind a notice that says it violates the company's rules about ""glorifying violence."" But because it's in the public's interest to be aware of the president's statements, Twitter said, users can click a View button in the notice to go ahead and read the tweet.

Twitter's actions appear to have been a tipping point in a relationship between conservatives and social media companies that's long been fraught. Republicans say their speech is being censored by Twitter, Facebook and other social media sites, though the companies have repeatedly denied that they engage in such censorship.

The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

“The fact is, whether he knows it yet or not, he will be leaving,” Pelosi told MSNBC “Morning Joe” co-host Mika Brzezinski. “Just because he might not want to move out of the White House doesn’t mean we won’t have an inauguration ceremony to inaugurate a duly elected president of the United States.

The House speaker pointed out that winning an election goes beyond literally living in the White House.

“There is a process,” she said. “It has nothing to do with the certain occupant of the White House doesn’t feel like moving and has to be fumigated out of there.”

On Sunday, Trump told Fox News host Chris Wallace that mail-in voting will “rig” the election (in reality, voting by mail does not lead election fraud) and hinted at rejecting the outcome of the race if Biden beats him.

“I have to see,” Trump said. “I’m not going to just say yes.”

jcxilb	liberal	The legal reckoning awaiting Donald Trump if he loses the election	"New York (CNN) If things don't go Donald Trump's way on Election Day , the President may face more serious matters than how to pack up the West Wing.

Without some of the protections afforded him by the presidency, Trump will become vulnerable to multiple investigations looking into possible fraud in his financial business dealings as a private citizen -- both as an individual and through his company. He faces defamation lawsuits sparked by his denials of accusations made by women who have alleged he assaulted them, including E. Jean Carroll, the former magazine columnist who has accused him of rape . And then there are claims he corrupted the presidency for his personal profits.

As President, Trump has been able to block and delay several of these investigations and lawsuits -- including a yearlong fight over a subpoena for his tax returns -- in part because of his official position. Many of those matters have wound through the courts and will come to a head whether he is reelected or not.

But with the polls showing that Democratic rival Joe Biden is leading in the race, the stakes become much higher for Trump if he loses the election. A raft of legal issues, including a criminal investigation by New York prosecutors, will come into focus in the weeks after Election Day.

""In every regard, his leaving office makes it easier for prosecutors and plaintiffs in civil cases to pursue their cases against him,"" said Harry Sandick, a former federal prosecutor in the Manhattan US attorney's office. ""For example, he is claiming a higher protection from subpoenas in the criminal cases and also in the congressional subpoena cases, [and that] is based largely on the fact that he is President.""

Some have suggested a formal apparatus for investigating Trump after he leaves office. Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat, has floated the creation of a ""Presidential Crimes Commission,"" made up of independent prosecutors who can examine ""those who enabled a corrupt president,"" as he put it in an August tweet. ""Example 1: Sabotaging the mail to win an election.""

The most serious legal threat facing Trump is the Manhattan district attorney's broad criminal investigation into the financial workings of the Trump Organization. Prosecutors have suggested in court filings that the investigation could examine whether the President and his company engaged in bank fraud, insurance fraud, criminal tax fraud and falsification of business records.

In the course of that probe, Trump has challenged a subpoena to his accounting firm for eight years of tax returns and financial records. Five courts have ruled the subpoena is valid, and last week Trump faced the latest setback when a federal appellate court denied his appeal, ruling that the grand jury subpoena was not overly broad or issued in bad faith. On Tuesday, Trump's lawyers asked the Supreme Court to block the enforcement of the subpoena to allow it time to appeal to the court. Trump already lost an appeal to the highest court in July, when it ruled that the president is not immune from a state grand jury subpoena.

New York prosecutors have said the tax records, working papers and documentation around business transactions are crucial to their investigation, which has been underway for more than a year.

There are legal questions as to whether a state prosecutor could file charges against a sitting president.

""He's so powerful right now. They know that they can't indict him right now so there is an incentive to build their case and get ready. I think what happens if he loses and leaves office that things will move very quickly,"" said Jennifer Rodgers, a CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor.

Playing fast and loose with value of company assets

The New York attorney general is also proceeding with a separate civil investigation into the Trump Organization and whether it improperly inflated the value of certain assets in some instances and lowered them in others, in an effort to secure loans and obtain economic and tax benefits.

Investigators are looking into the tax breaks taken at the Trump Seven Springs property in Bedford, New York, and the Trump National Golf Club in Los Angeles. They are also investigating the valuation of a Trump office tower on Wall Street and the forgiveness of a more than $100 million loan on the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago.

Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organization, sat remotely for a deposition with civil investigators last week . The lawyers are seeking additional depositions with Sheri Dillon, Trump's longtime tax lawyer.

Lawyers for the Trump Organization have said in court documents that they believe New York Attorney General Letitia James is politically motivated, and they initially tried to push off Eric Trump's deposition until after Election Day, but a judge rejected that request. The state lawyers, who have said they are not coordinating with any criminal law enforcement agency, said their investigation is civil in nature. But they could make a criminal referral if they believe there is enough evidence.

""With a big-time executive, when they do these multiple or hundreds of millions of dollar transactions, they're always advised by lawyers and accountants,"" said Dan Alonso, a former prosecutor with the Manhattan district attorney's office. ""There are a lot of layers between messing up the tax treatment and criminal liability on the part of the President, that's a big leap.""

Opening the floodgates to lawsuits

If Trump is not reelected, he will lose the deference that courts have given to sitting presidents, opening the floodgates for many lawsuits.

The state attorneys general of Washington, DC, and Maryland sued the President in 2017, alleging he corruptly profited off his position by placing his financial interests above those of American citizens.

The state investigators prepared more than 30 subpoenas, including to the Trump Organization, and others relating to the Trump businesses. Trump sued to block the lawsuit, which alleges he violated the emoluments clause of the Constitution by virtue of the hundreds of thousands of dollars that foreign governments and others have spent at his properties. Trump has appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court, which has not yet decided whether to hear the case. A second emoluments lawsuit brought by hotel and restaurant operators in New York is also pending.

In August, after a state court judge denied Trump's effort to delay a defamation lawsuit, the President deployed the Department of Justice to attempt to insert itself in the nearly yearlong litigation. The Justice Department asked a federal judge to substitute itself in place of Trump in a defamation lawsuit brought by Carroll, a onetime Elle magazine advice columnist, who accused the President of raping her in a department store dressing room in the mid-1990s. Trump has denied the allegation.

The move, if granted, could effectively kill the lawsuit, which has been winding through the courts since last November, because the Justice Department cannot be sued for defamation. A judge has scheduled a hearing in the case for Wednesday. Carroll has indicated she is seeking to depose the President under oath and to compare with a sample of male genetic material she says is on the dress she wore the day of the alleged rape.

Other lawsuits have also been on hold by virtue of Trump's status as President.

Another case awaiting decision is a defamation lawsuit filed in New York state court by a former contestant on ""The Apprentice,"" Summer Zervos, who claims Trump sexually assaulted her in 2007 . Zervos has said Trump kissed her on the lips during a lunch meeting in his New York City office and has alleged he kissed her aggressively and touched her breast during another encounter in Beverly Hills. She sued after she received harassment and threats following his denial of her claims, according to court filings.

After a New York state court judge denied Trump's effort to dismiss Zervos' lawsuit, the President appealed the ruling, arguing that the Constitution's Supremacy Clause bars a state court from hearing an action against a sitting president. The Zervos case is now awaiting a ruling by the New York state Court of Appeals on the question of whether the state courts have jurisdiction over him while he occupies the White House.

The president's niece, Mary Trump, is also suing Trump , his sister and the estate of their deceased brother for fraud, alleging they deprived her of her interests in the family real estate empire built by Fred Trump Sr.

In these civil cases, where in some instances Trump has sought to avoid testifying or providing DNA evidence, Sandick said Trump will lose the ability to argue he is afforded certain protections by the White House if he ends up exiting the Oval Office. ""If he's not President, all of that goes away.""

Less sway over potential witnesses

One wild card is what would happen to a decade-long civil tax audit conducted by the IRS, which falls under the Treasury Department, and whether it could be escalated under a Biden administration to the Justice Department for review. According to The New York Times , the IRS is looking at a $72.9 million tax refund credit Trump claimed.

Lawyers say a less obvious factor that could change if Biden wins is the sway Trump has held over accountants, bankers and those in his inner circle who could be crucial witnesses to authorities.

""They're going to be much less afraid to talk about someone who is no longer the president,"" Rodgers said. She added that a case involving allegations of false statements to banks or tax fraud would likely be heavily documented, which, once the subpoena for the tax returns is produced, could aid the investigation.

Of course, if Trump is reelected, it is possible he may be able to run out the statute of limitations, which for some crimes in New York state law is five to six years; push these lawsuits out another four years; or simply continue to enjoy the benefit of the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel opinion that says a sitting president can't be indicted.

The Office of Legal Counsel memo has already insulated Trump from possible indictment in two instances: the special counsel investigation led by Robert Mueller, which found evidence that Trump had committed obstruction of justice but didn't charge him, and the investigation by the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which cited Trump as ""Individual 1"" in charging his former lawyer Michael Cohen with campaign finance crimes for facilitating hush-money payments to two women who alleged affairs with Trump. Trump has denied the affairs. Cohen pleaded guilty and said under oath that Trump had directed him to break the law. Cohen was reimbursed for those payments from the Trump Organization well into 2017, which could extend the statute of limitations on that crime into 2022. Some lawyers have speculated that it's possible Trump would attempt to pardon himself from federal crimes before he leaves office.

The decision of whether to revive those investigations would fall to a Biden administration and top law enforcement officials leading the Justice Department and Manhattan US attorney's office.

In testimony before Congress, Mueller was asked by Republican Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado, ""Could you charge the President with a crime after he left office?""

""Yes,"" Mueller replied.

""You believe that he committed -- you could charge the President of the United States with obstruction of justice after he left office?"" Buck asked.

Mueller answered: ""Yes."""	left

The image showed a room full of elderly wheelchair users with Biden’s face superimposed on one of them. Biden is 77, Trump is 74.

Despite being only a few years apart, Trump and his campaign have invested big in trying to cast Biden as too old for the job. Trump has repeatedly called him “sleepy” and “stupid.” He’s seized on the former vice president’s speech issues and gaffes to claim he has dementia.

Trump has been hemorrhaging support from senior voters in the polls, due in part to his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, which carries higher risks for older people. Trump had a 9-percentage-point advantage with voters 65 and older in the 2016 election against Democrat Hillary Clinton, according to the Pew Research Center, but numerous polls now indicate Biden leads Trump with that group three weeks ahead of the Nov. 3 election.

A recent national Fox News survey found Biden had a narrow lead with likely voters 65 and older. A CNN poll found Biden was up by 21 percentage points, with 60% for Biden and 39% for Trump.

HuffPost has reached out to the Biden campaign for comment on Trump’s tweet.

At a Florida campaign event on Tuesday, Biden told potential voters at a senior citizen community center that Trump’s careless remarks about the coronavirus affecting “virtually nobody” show he doesn’t care about them.

“To Donald Trump, it’s simple, not a joke, you’re expendable. You’re forgettable. You’re virtually nobody. That’s how he sees seniors. That’s how he sees you,” Biden said.

The Trump camp has courted seniors with an eight-figure ad campaign in swing states. Last week, Trump tweeted a rambling video addressed to “my favorite people in the world, the seniors,” promising them a free COVID-19 “cure.”

While some Trump supporters appeared to find the president’s tweet funny, critics piled on. Some called it ageist, and others said it was a strange move for a candidate to further alienate a voting demographic whose support he has been losing.

kfqgds	liberal	Return of the Phony Deficit Hawks: Suddenly, Republicans are pretending to care about debt.	"It looks as if Congress will soon pass a much-needed economic relief (not stimulus) bill — something that will help distressed Americans get through the next few months, while we wait for widespread vaccination to set the stage for economic recovery. That’s good news, because something is better than nothing, even though what we know about the legislation says that it’s going to be deeply flawed.

But the way this debate has been playing out is ominous for the future. Even some of the good guys seem a bit confused about what they’re trying to do. And the bad guys — Mitch McConnell and company — are clearly doing some of the right things only under political duress, while giving every indication that they’ll systematically undermine the economy once President-elect Joe Biden takes office.

About good guys getting it wrong: Economic relief legislation is largely about providing individuals and families with a financial lifeline during the pandemic. But who should get that lifeline? Should it go to a majority of the population, like those $1,200 checks sent out in the spring? Or should the focus be on enhanced unemployment benefits for the millions of workers who, thanks to the pandemic, have no income at all?

According to The Washington Post, Senators Bernie Sanders and Joe Manchin had a heated argument about this issue on Wednesday during a conference call, with Sanders pushing for broad aid while Manchin argued that enhanced unemployment benefits were more crucial."	left

kqe240	liberal	Exhaustive list refuting every claim made by trump in hour long phone call. Refer to this when people try to back Trumps insanity.	"Georgia election: Donald Trump's phone call fact-checked By Reality Check team

BBC News Published 4 January

media caption Donald Trump: ""I just want to find 11,780 votes""

US President Donald Trump spent more than an hour on the phone to election officials in Georgia, as he continues to try to overturn the result in the state.

He made a number of accusations of fraud for which he did not provide evidence.

We've fact-checked some of his claims.

Claim 1: 'So dead people voted. And I think the number is close to 5,000 people [in Georgia].'

President Trump and his supporters have repeatedly claimed thousands of votes were cast in states across the country, using the identities of people who had died.

But Georgia's top election official, Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, rejected the president's assertion, saying there were just two confirmed cases of votes attributed to dead people.

The president's lawyer Cleta Mitchell, also on the call, responded to this by suggesting they had details of dead people voting.

""There is a universe of people who have the same name and same birth year and died,"" she told Mr Raffensperger.

However, our previous investigation into a list of ""10,000 dead voters"" in Michigan found this approach seriously flawed.

Cross-referencing lists of deaths across the US and voters in a particular state produces thousands of matches - with the same name and birth year - both dead and alive.

Our study in Michigan produced a large number of matches even when the month of birth was included.

And we also contacted a sample of these ""dead voters"" and found them very much alive.

Claim 2: '[There] were thousands and thousands of ballots in a box that was not an official or a sealed box.'

The president is referring to a video taken at a counting facility at the State Farm Arena, in Fulton County, Georgia, suggesting it reveals fraudulent activity by election workers.

The footage shows officials returning to their counting areas and a container with ballots being pulled out from under a table

""When they came back,"" Mr Trump said in his phone call, ""they didn't go to their station.

""They went to the apron wrapped around the table, under which were thousands and thousands of ballots in a box that was not an official or a sealed box.""

Election officials have previously responded to this accusation, saying the footage shows normal practice.

Gabriel Sterling, the voting system implementation manager in Georgia, tweeted state investigators who had watched the whole video had found nothing untoward.

image copyright Getty Images image caption Georgia's voting systems manager Gabriel Sterling has pushed back against the president's claims

An official investigation found ""the entire security footage revealed there were no mystery ballots that were brought in from an unknown location and hidden under tables as has been reported by some"".

Fulton County elections director Richard Barron said workers ""put those ballot bins under their workspace because it's the most convenient place to put those things"".

And state authorities said there was nothing unofficial about the boxes containing the ballots.

Claim 3: 'They ran out because of a water-main break. And there was no water main, there was nothing. There was no break.'

Mr Trump is referring to a pause in the counting at the same location in Fulton County.

At the time, election officers issued a press statement saying a water leak had affected a room where absentee ballots were being tabulated.

An official investigation later clarified ""what was initially reported as a water leak... was actually a urinal that had overflowed"".

The report said this had not affected the counting of votes by Fulton County which resumed later that evening.

President Trump also said when election workers had returned ""there were no Republican poll watchers - actually, there were no Democrat poll watchers"".

This is true - but the official investigation found they had been neither asked to leave nor prevented from returning.

Frances Watson, chief investigator for the Georgia secretary of state, said: ""Nobody gave them any advice on what they should do.

""And it was still open for them or the public to come back in to view at whatever time they wanted to.""

Claim 4: 'You had out-of-state voters - they voted in Georgia but they were from out of state - of 4,925.'

Ryan Germany, a lawyer representing Georgia's secretary of state's office during the call, has rejected this claim.

""Every one we've been through are people that lived in Georgia, moved to a different state but then moved back to Georgia legitimately,"" he said.

The numbers given by Mr Trump's team regarding these supposed out-of-state voters were ""not accurate"", Mr Germany added.

Speaking ahead of Tuesday's Senate run-off election in Georgia, Mr Raffensperger said ""qualified Georgians and only Georgians are allowed to vote in our elections"" and out-of-state voters would not be tolerated.

And he warned anyone attempting to game the system: ""We will find you and we will prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law.""

Claim 5: ""They're shredding ballots. And you should look at that very carefully. Because that's so illegal.""

The president mentioned what he said was the alleged shredding of ""thousands"" of ""corrupt"" ballot papers, implying that evidence of what he believes was voting malpractice had been deliberately destroyed.

In November, some social media posts claimed to show shredding companies destroying what were said to be ballot papers.

An investigation into the shredding of papers in Georgia's Cobb County concluded that it was part of a ""routine clean-up operation"" and the documents disposed of were not actual votes ""relevant to the election or the re-tally"".

These were old mailing labels and other papers with voter information, old e-mails and duplicate absentee ballot forms.

Claim 6: ""We have not gone through your Dominion [voting machines], so we can't give them blessing. I mean, in other states, we think we found tremendous corruption with Dominion machines...""

The president has made various allegations about widespread electronic voting fraud in several swing states.

He claims that the Dominion voting systems, which are widely used across the US, including in Georgia, led to millions of Trump votes being flipped to his rival Joe Biden.

But there is no evidence of this in Georgia or anywhere else, and several lawsuits regarding the claims have been rejected by courts.

Dominion Voting Systems have denied their machines were in any way compromised."	left

h0idc7	liberal	Delusional President Demands CNN Retract Poll Showing Him Down 14 to Biden	"Photo: Shutterstock

Yesterday, President Trump lashed out at CNN’s poll showing him losing to Joe Biden by 14 points, directing legendarily inaccurate Republican pollster John McLaughlin to write a memo claiming the network deliberately engineered a false result.

Today, Trump has sent a letter to the network, signed by actual lawyers, demanding it retract the poll. CNN has obviously refused, explaining why its poll is in fact legitimate and not Fake. CNN’s result, showing Biden ahead by 14 points, is at the top end of a range of recent polling, but many other surveys have found Biden leading by low double digits.

As is the case with many of his erratic moves, the question arises whether Trump is actually suffering from a serious mental illness, or is instead pretending to believe something fantastical in an effort to rally his base. In this case, there is a plausible story for why Trump could be acting out of conscious cynicism. He seems to believe that polls themselves exert a strong pull on election outcomes, and that unfavorable polling will discourage his supporters from showing up.

On the other hand, there is a fair amount of evidence suggesting Trump is not playing a clever messaging game, or even a stupid one, but actually believes his own lies.

A month and a half ago, Trump threatened to sue his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, for bringing him bad polls, according to both the Washington Post and CNN. “Trump told Parscale that he did not believe the polling that had been presented to him, even though it came from the campaign and the RNC,” the Post reported. “‘I’m not losing to Joe Biden,’” Trump said at one point, both of these people said, adding that the president used profanities throughout the call.” The Post also reported that Parscale managed to mollify the boss by bringing “polling numbers that were more positive for Trump,” which resulted in Trump being “in a far better mood.”

Two days ago, the Daily Beast reported that Trump’s reelection campaign is spending $400,000 to run pro-Trump ads in Washington, D.C. The Washington market has no value — Trump is not seriously contesting either the city or its suburbs. The point is to soothe the president. “With Trump stuck in that milieu of anxiety, his re-election team is hoping that the ads may put him at ease that his formidable political machine is hard at work defending him and attacking his enemies,” notes the report.

This morning, the Washington Post casually drops the following sentence into the middle of an account of the campaign’s difficulties: “Trump has become obsessed with polling and lashes out at those who say he is losing to Biden, according to two White House officials and a longtime Trump ally.”

The reporters, perhaps because their sensitivities have been dulled by years of daily exposure to this kind of madness, immediately moved on to other points, rather than linger over the sheer irrationality revealed by this line. It is quite a conundrum for the president’s staff. He is obsessed with polls, but he becomes enraged upon being informed he’s losing to Biden. Given that every poll shows him losing to Biden, his advisers don’t seem to have a lot of good options.

Imagine we were discussing a regular person suffering this kind of pathology. (Jim loves Nascar, can’t get enough of it, wants to watch it all the time, but the sight of automobiles makes him go ballistic, so don’t let him see any cars.) We would be talking about finding him help.

The balance of evidence suggests that Trump, at some level, actually subscribes to the fantasy he’s constructed. And he’s surrounded himself with lackeys who will play along with the fantasy. McLaughlin, whose extraordinarily inaccurate and overly favorable polling has caused Republicans to warn against hiring him, wrote a bizarre memo filled with irrelevant or tendentious objections to CNN’s methodology. His lawyers cite these absurd points in constructing an even more fanciful demand that CNN somehow retract and apologize for its polling.

Perhaps these people are not trying to inspire the Trump base, but are instead creating a Truman Show–like fantasy world for their client."	left
hruxly	liberal	Senior Trump campaign lawyer critical of mail-in ballots voted by mail three times	"(CNN) A top Trump campaign adviser and lawyer who has criticized voting-by-mail and warned without evidence that it could lead to election fraud previously voted by mail at least three times.

Jenna Ellis voted by mail in Colorado in 2012, 2013 and 2014, according to public records obtained by CNN's KFile.

Colorado is one of five states that conducts its elections entirely by mail. The state sends a ballot to every registered voter by mail and the voter returns a cast ballot in a signed envelope to their local county clerk's office. (Voters can also vote in person at the ballot box if they prefer.)

Ellis joins a growing list of Trump campaign and White House staffers who have publicly criticized mail-in ballots and voting-by-mail but privately cast an absentee or mail-in ballot themselves, including President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, second lady Karen Pence, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany and campaign manager Brad Parscale.

In a statement, Ellis told CNN that Trump is ""absolutely right that mail-in voting is ripe for fraud"" and pointed to the ""horrendous results"" in Pennsylvania and New Jersey elections, both of which used mail-in voting because of the coronavirus pandemic.

In Philadelphia , officials identified 40 people who had returned a mail ballot and then also voted in person. The votes were caught in time to prevent double voting and there was no evidence of fraud. In New Jersey, the attorney general charged four people with voting fraud related to a municipal election in May. Both states continue to tally the votes but hundreds of thousands have been cast in each state.

Ellis told CNN, ""I live in Colorado, and unfortunately my state is one of only five that are universal vote-by-mail states. Even though President Trump and I agree it is a flawed method of running an election — and I will continue to work to change it — I won't let that discourage me from exercising my right to vote.""

Ellis, a frequent surrogate for the President, is also the public face of a Trump campaign lawsuit -- along with several Republican congressmen and the Republican National Committee -- filed against Pennsylvania's counties over the state's plans to use mail-in ballots for the general election this November over coronavirus safety concerns.

In a press release , Ellis said, without evidence, that moving toward a vote-by-mail system would create opportunities for fraud.

""Shifting from an absentee voting system to one that pushes unmonitored vote-by-mail creates opportunities for fraud, and encourages ballot harvesting where paid political operatives try to collect and deliver loose ballots. This lawsuit seeks to restore integrity into the process and mandate the ability of campaigns to monitor the casting, collecting, and counting of all votes. Every American, regardless of which candidates they support, should be concerned that our elections remain free and fair.""

Ellis also bashed House Democrats' proposal to institute universal mail-in ballots for the election. In an op-ed , she claimed that Democrats are trying to use the coronavirus pandemic as ""as an excuse and pretext to remove many safeguards for elections"" to implement universal mail-in ballots.

""They treat mail-in ballots as a cure-all and make a pitch for the 'bold democratic reform bill' offered by the House Democrats in Congress. But what they don't tell you is that an overnight change to universal mail-in ballots will potentially disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of voters and that their so-called 'bold proposals' are merely an attempt to get more votes for their party,"" wrote Ellis and her co-writer, Justin Clark, a senior political adviser to the Trump campaign.

Ellis and Clark were careful to note that ""absentee ballots are a great way to vote for the many senior citizens, military, and others who can't get to the polls on election day"" in their op-ed. On Twitter, Ellis voiced support for using an absentee ballot if necessary, but still encouraged in-person voting. ""Voting IN PERSON can and will happen in November! If we can stand in line at the grocery store & hardware store, we can stand in line to vote! If you need an absentee ballot, definitely vote that way (like some in DC will have to in home state!), but let's SHOW UP & VOTE TRUMP!"" she wrote

On Twitter, Ellis frequently differentiated absentee ballots from mail-in ballots, but experts say absentee ballots and mail-in ballots, while distinct terms, are nearly indistinguishable from one another in practice. Absentee ballots are requested by registered voters who cannot otherwise vote in person; mail-in ballots are simply sent through the mail, and can be considered absentee ballots or no-excuse absentee ballots depending on a state's election laws.

In one tweet , she wrote that the President ""schooled reporters"" on the difference between ""ABSENTEE voting (a registered voter requesting a ballot) vs MAIL-IN plans (sending millions of ballots out into the ether without knowing if a person is dead, moved, etc). ELECTION SECURITY MATTERS!""

In another tweet , she reiterated her definitions, writing, ""Thread. Again, this isn't that complicated of a distinction, folks. Absentee: one voter asks for their own ballot to be mailed to them. Mail-in system: state mails out millions of ballots to unverified addresses and recipients.""

Ellis was not always publicly critical of mail-in ballots, however. In 2018, while Ellis served as the policy director for the conservative Dobson Family Institute, she wrote a blog post encouraging Christians to register to vote and use state voting methods, including mail-in ballots, early voting and day-of voting."	left
kn2usn	liberal	Pence refused to sign on to plan to overturn election, lawyers say	"Lawyers representing Rep. Louie Gohmert Louis (Louie) Buller GohmertPence to give keynote address at National Conservative Student Conference Gaetz, House Republicans introduce bill to defund Postal Service covert operations program 136 Republicans get Fs in accountability rankings from anti-Trump GOP group MORE (R-Texas) and a group of Arizona Republicans disclosed in a court filing Tuesday that Vice President Pence rejected their request to join their attempt to subvert the results of the presidential election.

Gohmert and 11 GOP ""alternate"" electors from Arizona – who met and unofficially cast their ballots for Trump despite him losing the state – filed suit against Pence on Monday in an attempt to argue that the vice president has sole authority to determine which presidential electors Congress will count when it certifies the results of the election. The far-fetched suit essentially asks the court to grant Pence the authority on Jan. 6 to overrule the results in swing states such as Arizona and have Congress count only pro-Trump electors instead of the ones President-elect Joe Biden Joe BidenRepublican seeks to use Obama energy policies to criticize Biden WSJ editorial board: 'Purging Liz Cheney for honesty would diminish' GOP DNC gathers opposition research on over 20 potential GOP presidential candidates MORE won.

In new court filings made public Tuesday, the plaintiffs disclosed that they had reached out to Pence before filing their suit in an attempt to join forces but that their talks did not reach any kind of agreement.

“In the teleconference, Plaintiffs' counsel made a meaningful attempt to resolve the underlying legal issues by agreement, including advising the Vice President's counsel that Plaintiffs intended to seek immediate injunctive relief in the event the parties did not agree,” lawyers for Gohmert and the electors said in the filing. “Those discussions were not successful in reaching an agreement and this lawsuit was filed.”

The revelation was made in a filing in which Gohmert’s attorneys sought an expedited schedule for a ruling to try to press U.S. District Judge Jeremy Kernodle of the Eastern District of Texas, a Trump appointee, to decide the case by Jan. 4, two days before the certification.

The decision by Pence, one of President Trump’s most ardent loyalists, marks one of the most notable breaks with his boss, who has pushed lawmakers to challenge Congress’s certification of the Electoral College results. Pence will oversee the joint session on Jan. 6 during which Biden will be recognized by Congress as the victor in the White House election, though the role is largely ceremonial.

Pence has not made any public remarks indicating how he plans to handle the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress, nor has he commented on Trump’s unrelenting pressure campaign urging lawmakers to reverse the Electoral College results.

Trump’s efforts to influence the Electoral College certification comes after a sprawling legal campaign to overturn results in individual states on allegations of voter fraud and irregularities largely failed. Virtually all of the GOP cases were tossed in court for lack of evidence or standing.

Editor's note: An earlier version of this story misidentified the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. The suit was filed by Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) and 11 Republicans from Arizona who call themselves ""alternate"" electors, though President-elect Joe Biden won the state."	left
jbpm88	liberal	California GOP Says It Will Not Comply With Order To Remove Unauthorized Ballot Boxes	"The California Republican Party said Wednesday it will not comply with the state’s cease-and-desist order over unofficial ballot drop boxes which have made their way into at least four counties across the state.

“Ballot harvesting program will continue,” California Republican Party spokesman Hector Barajas told CNN in a statement defending the boxes which have been found in Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange and Fresno.

In spite of the cease and desist order, Barajas said Wednesday that the party may expand the program.

“We’re going to continue this program,” Barajas told CNN affiliate KABC in an interview. “If you want to take us to court, then we’ll see you in court.”

The comments appeared to echo a message from Trump who tweeted a day earlier that his party should fight the order.

“You mean only Democrats are allowed to do this? But haven’t the Dems been doing this for years? See you in court. Fight hard Republicans!” Trump tweeted Tuesday night after railing for months without evidence against what he has repeatedly called widespread “fraudulent” mail-in voting.

In a letter to the California Secretary of State on Wednesday attorneys for the state’s Republican Party said all of the ballot boxes dispatched by the party were indoors and staffed by volunteers or party officials. The letter also said that the unauthorized boxes were secure and not labeled “official.”

Images of the ballot boxes have shown that the unofficial boxes are labeled as “official,” but the state GOP contends in the letter that it had not authorized the term to be used and that the labels had been removed.

“The California Republican Party did not promote, or authorize the promotion of, the secure boxes as ‘official mail drop boxes,'” the letter states. “When we learned that a sign using the word ‘official’ was used in some locations on Saturday, October, 10, 2020, we corrected that error immediately and within hours.”

A spokesperson for California Secretary of State Alex Padilla (D) told CNN that Padilla’s office reviewing the GOP response letter.

During a CNN interview on Monday, Padilla called the drop boxes “fake” telling CNN’s Chris Cuomo that the move was wrong regardless of which party was dispatching the unauthorized boxes.

“We don’t have the requirements or regulations for these fake drop boxes as you do for the official drop boxes,” Padilla said adding that voters should instead be directed to official drop boxes which meet all state requirements.

Secure drop boxes that are state-sanctioned and monitored — have been widely promoted by voting rights advocates, including in California, where official boxes are widely accessible.

Outside of California, Republican officials have sung a different tune, moving to limit access to authorized drop boxes in states like Texas and Pennsylvania. On Friday, a federal appeals court temporarily reinstated limits on the expansion of ballot drop boxes in Ohio, suggesting “the State cannot be faulted for these voters’ choice to not take advantage of the other avenues available to them to cast their ballot.”"	left
m5kpqe	liberal	House Democrats draw the line: No bipartisan cooperation with Republicans who questioned the election - After the Jan. 6 riot, some Democrats say they simply can't work with anyone who voted against certifying the election.	"WASHINGTON – Freshman Rep. Jake Auchincloss, a Democrat, has begun turning to an unusual source when trying to decide whether he wants to work with a Republican he thinks makes a good point during committee hearings: Google.

The Massachusetts lawmaker says he knows his constituents want him to work across the aisle, but he's drawing “a sharp red line” at working with Republicans who voted not to certify the Electoral College results as part of then-President Donald Trump's failed bid to overturn his election defeat.

If a quick search produces evidence that one of his Republican colleagues refused to acknowledge President Joe Biden's win, he said, “I kind of throw cold water on the whole thing,” adding that while he doesn't like political litmus tests, ""insurrection against the United States government qualifies.”

Auchincloss is not alone.

Democratic lawmakers are each drawing their own lines, and some are finding that it means there are colleagues whom they once worked with to craft bipartisan legislation but with whom they now are unable, or unwilling, to collaborate.

The Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol set off an impeachment proceeding and hundreds of criminal cases, but it's also having a lasting impact on Congress to get even some of the most basic and mundane tasks completed.

The public tends to pay close attention when Congress does things like pass $2 trillion spending bills. But it's the day-to-day activities that get little attention and keep the place buzzing.

Democrats say, for the time being, it's about Republicans not sharing a fundamental belief in democracy and elections.

Rep. Sean Casten, D-Ill., objected to a routine House task of naming a post office because it was proposed by Republican Rep. Trent Kelly, R-Miss., whom Democrats accuse of supporting the protest Jan. 6 and who also voted to overturn the Electoral College vote in two states.

Rep. Brad Schneider, D-Ill., has a basic requirement before he can work with a Republican: “At the fundamental level, I need an affirmative statement that Joe Biden is the legitimate president of the United States and the 2020 election was an honest and fair election.”

Schneider, a member of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus that is known for reaching across the aisle, said that in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 riot, he has had to cut off previous working relationships.

He and Republican Rep. Jody Hice, of Georgia, were working together on a task force the two co-founded on ethylene oxide, a toxic carcinogen that is particularly problematic in the Chicago and the Atlanta areas.

But he told Hice he couldn't work with him after the Republican continued to claim the election was affected by fraud, most recently saying at the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, that Trump only lost Georgia because of “the horrible” Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, also a Republican.

“It’s hard to envision going into an administration with a partner who doesn’t acknowledge the legitimacy of that administration or is showing a commitment to the truth,” Schneider said.

Schneider also told Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., that he could no longer sponsor a bill that the two have worked on together since 2017 that provides Family and Medical Leave Act protections to parents who lost a child. Gosar has been one of the most vocal supporters of false claims that the election was stolen.

“If I want to try to move this bill forward, I’ve got to have the credibility on both sides. And (he) makes it a little bit more difficult,” Schneider said.

Rep. Cindy Axne, a Democrat from Iowa, tweeted Jan. 25 about her desire to secure bipartisan accomplishments.

But the next day, Republican Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri responded — posting an image of an email between their offices. The subject line of the Jan. 11 email appeared to ask if Axne wanted to co-sponsor a bill on ""kidney insurance.""

A staff member in Axne's office appeared to reply, ""I hope you are ok and managing. Our office is declining to work with your office at this time given your boss's position on the election.""

In sharing the email correspondence, Smith asked, ""Are you no longer kicking Republicans off your bills?""

Axne refiled the bill Tuesday, unveiling it with Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Wash., who voted to impeach Trump.

That’s odd…this is the last message my staff got from you. Are you no longer kicking Republicans off your bills? https://t.co/8lkpvhHWnC pic.twitter.com/IdgL02l4Pi — Rep. Jason Smith (@RepJasonSmith) January 26, 2021

Democrats are also calling out their Republican colleagues. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., the chair of the House Administration Committee, released a nearly 2,000 page “social media review” of Republican members in the lead-up to January 6. The report is intended to create a compilation of members’ public comments that could be used going forward.

The slowdown isn't one-sided.

A small number of Republicans are blocking the quick passage of typically noncontroversial, bipartisan bills in the House known as suspension bills because of frustration with Democrats for not allowing amendments on legislation.

""Suspensions are, frankly, the one item that we have left that we have dealt with on a bipartisan basis,” House Democratic Leader Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters Tuesday.

Rep. Ann McLane Kuster, D-N.H., said she will only work with Republicans who “recognize the lawful election of Joe Biden.”

Kuster says she asked her staff to look at Republicans’ social media feeds to determine if they meet her standards, calling it “painful” when a Republican she worked with over her eight years in Congress is someone she can no longer work with.

“If you don’t recognize our democracy at this point in time, then I don’t think you’re going to be helpful to successful legislation,” she said."	left
lyd7qp	liberal	Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren quietly releases massive social media report on GOP colleagues who voted to overturn the election	"Washington (CNN) Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren has quietly posted a nearly 2,000-page report documenting social media posts by her Republican colleagues who voted against certifying results of the presidential election on January 6. The information compiled isn't secret, but the report is another sign of the deep distrust that has settled into the US Capitol in the weeks since the insurrection.

The report chronicles the social media activity of members on public forums immediately before the November election and right after the January 6 riot. The report has been online for a week.

CNN reported earlier Thursday that federal investigators are examining records of communications between members of Congress and the pro-Trump mob that attacked the Capitol, as the investigation moves closer to exploring whether lawmakers wittingly or unwittingly helped the insurrectionists.

In a preamble to the report, Lofgren -- the chair of the House Administration Committee -- wrote that she had asked her staff to pull the relevant social media posts and compile them in an effort to gather facts.

""Any appropriate disciplinary action is a matter not only of the Constitution and law, but also of fact,"" the California Democrat wrote. ""Many of former President Trump's false statements were made in very public settings. Had Members made similar public statements in the weeks and months before the January 6th attack? Statements which are readily available in the public arena may be part of any consideration of Congress' constitutional prerogatives and responsibilities.""

Riggleman, a first-term lawmaker representing Virginia's 5th Congressional district, was defeated in his June renomination bid and will leave Congress in January 2021.

GOP Rep. Denver Riggleman of Virginia slammed President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans in a recent interview with Forbes, calling the party's large-scale refusal to acknowledge President-elect Joe Biden's victory a ""massive grift"" and saying that Trump has ""never served anything but himself.""

Riggleman, an outgoing congressman and one of a handful of House Republicans who are openly acknowledging Biden's presidential win, said that the current posturing by the party is ""just money-making for the 2024 election"" and ""completely unethical.""

The conservative congressman said that the fear of Trump's wrath was motivating many House Republicans to prioritize their individual careers over accepting the election results.

""They're worried about committee assignments, they're worried about the team,"" Riggleman said of Republicans who are standing with the president. Trump, Riggleman said, can ""cost them their careers"" and for many members, ""the career is more important than the facts, it's that simple.""

On November 23, after weeks of delaying the transition plans of President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, General Services Administration (GSA) head Emily Murphy finally ""ascertained"" Biden as the winner of the election. Murphy received a torrent of criticism regarding the delay, which held up millions of dollars in federal funds for Biden and Harris.

In the Forbes interview, Riggleman let loose on Murphy, saying that ""she should've done this well before she did it"" and said that the delay was the result of a ""fear of losing your tribe.""

He added: ""I'm so damn sick of it. I'm sick of it.""

While Trump has filed a litany of unsuccessful lawsuits across the country to support his last-ditch legal efforts in overturning Biden's 306-232 Electoral College victory, Riggleman criticized Republicans who believe the claims of mass voter fraud, saying that it ""really speaks to where your intelligence level is...to believe in that type of operation.""

Riggleman had even harsher words for Trump.

""He got so desperate to retain power that he forgot he was serving people and not himself,"" Riggleman said, adding that the president has ""never served anything but himself, when you talk about his businesses and what he's done.""

The congressman said that Trump was ""irresponsible"" for ""embracing theories and groups that are dehumanizing and have an anti-Semitic base,"" along with ""groups that are just anti-American.""

During his time in office, Riggleman has been highly critical of the QAnon movement, which promotes an array of unfounded internet-based conspiracy theories. In September, he introduced a bipartisan House resolution with Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski of New Jersey that condemned the movement. It passed overwhelmingly, by a 371-18 vote.

Riggleman also offered words of praise to Biden, calling him ""a steady hand"" whose political appointees can ""ensure this country stays on a relatively stable path."" He even said that he'd be open to working for the incoming Democratic administration.

""It would have to be something where I'm serving this country and not sort of a token position,"" Riggleman said, pointing out his background in defense and counterterrorism issues.

Riggleman, a first-term lawmaker representing Virginia's 5th Congressional district, was defeated in his June renomination bid by former Liberty University Athletic Department staffer Bob Good in a controversial outdoor drive-through convention. In the November election, Good defeated Democratic nominee Cameron Webb for the open seat in a closely fought race.

In October, Riggleman appeared on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" lamenting the state of American politics. On the program, he said it was ""difficult"" to be a part of any political party right now.

""I'm a Republican, what I thought a constitutional Republican was, but the way the GOP is going in Virginia, it's very difficult for me to stay with any party,"" he said. ""I believe duopoly is really, the two-party system is really failing the American people right now."""	left
k0ehrx	liberal	White House killed deal to pay for mental health care for migrant families separated at border	"WASHINGTON — The Trump White House blocked the Justice Department from making a deal in October 2019 to pay for mental health services for migrant families who had been separated by the Trump administration, two current and two former senior administration officials told NBC News.

Three sources involved in the discussions who requested anonymity said the Office of White House Counsel made the decision to reject the settlement of a federal lawsuit after consultation with senior adviser Stephen Miller, the driving force behind many of President Donald Trump's immigration policies, including family separations.

""DOJ strongly, and unanimously, supported the settlement, but not all agencies involved were on the same page,"" an administration official said. ""Ultimately, the settlement was declined at the direction of the White House counsel's office.""

Another administration official said: ""Ultimately, it was Stephen who prevailed. He squashed it.""

The White House's refusal to accept the deal ended up costing taxpayers $6 million.

A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, did not say why the White House counsel's office rejected the settlement and denied that Miller was involved: ""Mr. Miller was not involved, and any suggestion that he was is false.""

After nine months of negotiations, primarily in Los Angeles, an $8 million settlement for screening and counseling thousands of migrants had been ""agreed to in principle"" by both lawyers for the Justice Department and lawyers representing the migrant families, said Mark Rosenbaum, a lawyer with the pro bono public interest law firm Public Counsel representing the families.

Rosenbaum said the pressure to come to an agreement, and quickly, was mounting.

""Many of these children thought their parents had deliberately abandoned them. The longer that trauma goes unredressed, the more severe the consequences,"" Rosenbaum said. ""We had a deal, a good deal. Everybody was feeling good about where we were. Then they came back and said no.""

The lawyers representing the government recommended approval to their superiors in Washington. At the Justice Department, Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Claire Murray took the figure to the Office of White House Counsel. It was there that the settlement was rejected, according to the two current and two former administration officials."	left
i74zoc	liberal	Facebook employees report 'pattern of preferential treatment' for conservatives who spread misinformation	"Conservatives frequently claim Facebook is biased against them. Facebook employees say it's the other way around.

While Facebook has been resistant to fact checking content on its site, it has gathered a team of fact checkers who are supposed to flag blatant or harmful misinformation. But Facebook employees say that hasn't happened when misinformation comes from conservative outlets, creating a ""pattern of preferential treatment for right-wing publishers and pages,"" BuzzFeed News reports.

The spread of misinformation on Facebook has worried its employees, who reportedly asked CEO Mark Zuckerberg last Friday why the far-right site Breitbart News is still a Facebook News partner, receiving compensation and special placement on Facebook's news tab, after promoting unfounded coronavirus treatments and saying masks aren't necessary. Zuckerberg reportedly responded that Breitbart had one strike of misinformation against it in the past 90 days, and it needs two to be removed from the news tab.

But Facebook employees say Breitbart, along with other conservative publishers including Charlie Kirk, Diamond and Silk, and Prager University, have all ""received special treatment"" and had some misinformation overlooked, BuzzFeed continues. ""It appears that policy people have been intervening in fact-checks on behalf of *exclusively* right-wing publishers, to avoid them getting repeat-offender status,"" one employee wrote on an internal message board.

Employees say they're concerned about more than just incorrect information and conspiracy theories. ""I do think we're headed for a problematic scenario where Facebook is going to be used to aggressively undermine the legitimacy of the U.S. elections, in a way that has never been possible in history,"" one employee wrote on an internal message board this week.

A Facebook spokesperson told BuzzFeed ""we defer to third-party fact-checkers on the rating that a piece of content receives,"" and punish misinformation spreaders from there. Read more at BuzzFeed News. Kathryn Krawczyk"	left
g9ozzt	liberal	Trump reportedly ignored intel briefings on coronavirus threat	"In recent weeks, there have been a variety of reports about the coronavirus warnings Donald Trump and his team received, but failed to heed. This Washington Post report, however, strikes me as the most devastating.

U.S. intelligence agencies issued warnings about the novel coronavirus in more than a dozen classified briefings prepared for President Trump in January and February, months during which he continued to play down the threat, according to current and former U.S. officials. The repeated warnings were conveyed in issues of the President's Daily Brief, a sensitive report that is produced before dawn each day and designed to call the president's attention to the most significant global developments and security threats.

As the Post's report explained, the PDB did precisely what it was supposed to do: it highlighted the growing viral threat; it raised doubts about the veracity of the claims from Chinese officials; and it warned of dire domestic consequences. What's more, the frequency with which the coronavirus was mentioned in the PDB ""reflected a level of attention comparable to periods when analysts have been tracking active terrorism threats, overseas conflicts or other rapidly developing security issues.""

Common sense suggests a president would receive see intelligence briefings like this one and take swift action to prevent a disaster from unfolding in his own country. And yet, the more intelligence officials issued warnings, the more Donald Trump publicly downplayed the threat and took few steps to address the looming crisis.

One possibility is that the president questioned the reliability of the information. The Republican has, after all, spent several years denigrating the work of his own country's intelligence professionals.

But the more likely explanation is that he never bothered to read the information in the first place. As the Post's article added, ""[T]he alarms appear to have failed to register with the president, who routinely skips reading the PDB and has at times shown little patience for even the oral summary he takes two or three times per week.""

This may seem brutally damning, but it's actually a staple of Trump's presidency. Indeed, we learned more than two years ago that he ""rarely, if ever"" reads the PDB prepared for him.

Trump has been surprisingly candid on this point, repeatedly acknowledging his disinterest in reading intelligence reports. During his transition process in 2016, for example, he skipped nearly all of his intelligence briefings. Asked why, the Republican told Fox News in December 2016, ""Well, I get it when I need it.... I don't have to be told -- you know, I'm, like, a smart person.""

As his inauguration drew closer, Trump acknowledged that he likes very short intelligence briefings. ""I like bullets or I like as little as possible,"" he explained in January 2017. Around the same time, he added, ""I don't need, you know, 200-page reports on something that can be handled on a page. That I can tell you.""

As regular readers know, intelligence professionals have gone to great lengths to accommodate the president's toddler-like attention span, preparing reports ""with lots of graphics and maps."" National Security Council officials have even learned that Trump is likely to stop reading important materials unless he sees his name, so they include his name in ""as many paragraphs"" as possible.

In August 2017, the Washington Post had a piece on then-White House National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster, who struggled to ""hold the attention of the president"" during briefings on Afghanistan. The article noted, ""[E]ven a single page of bullet points on the country seemed to tax the president's attention span on the subject.""

A Trump confidant said at the time, ""I call the president the two-minute man. The president has patience for a half-page.""

Evidently, more than a dozen warnings about the novel coronavirus in January and February couldn't be reduced enough.

On Aug. 6, 2001, then-President George W. Bush received an intelligence briefing and was handed the ""Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S."" memo. He was on a month-long vacation at the time. After listening to the briefer, Bush reportedly replied, ""All right. You've covered your ass, now."" A month later, we saw the consequences.

Nearly two decades later, Trump received multiple reports with equally serious warnings about a viral threat. We're still dealing with the consequences now.

Postscript: As regular readers may recall, Trump used to take an interest in the presidential daily intelligence briefing, as we saw in 2014, when he seemed convinced that Barack Obama wasn’t taking the national-security briefings as seriously as he should.

“Fact – Obama does not read his intelligence briefings,” Trump complained, making up details that in no way reflected reality. Around the same time, Trump added, “Obama has missed 58% of his intelligence briefings” – which, again, was completely untrue.

The irony is hard to miss."	left
klvckk	liberal	Donald Trump’s pardons must not obstruct justice: Abuses of constitutional clemency power should be investigated and prosecuted	"The writer is a Harvard professor of constitutional law

If, as Alexander Pope reflected in 1711, “to err is human, to forgive, divine,” then the US Constitution’s pardon power — the prerogative of forgiveness — should be beyond reproach.

Instead, a godless US president who appears incapable of forgiveness has seemingly perverted this instrument of mercy into another grave threat to the rule of law. Donald Trump’s recent twisting of the pardon power risks leaving a damaging legacy: a blueprint for manipulating this vestige of royal prerogative to place presidents and their cronies above the law. But a remedy exists: investigation and potential prosecution. We must treat any obstructions of justice we uncover as the crimes they are.

It is critical to distinguish between two types of corrupt pardons. There are those that are merely contemptible for their intrinsic immorality — they may give a free walk to American war criminals (the Blackwater contractors convicted of a massacre), corrupt politicians (former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, convicted of trying to sell a Senate seat), and relatives (Mr Trump’s son-in-law’s criminally convicted father Charles Kushner). There are others that pose structural dangers by placing the president and his circle above the law and thwarting investigations into wrongdoing.

Pardons in the former category, detestable as they are, not only fall within the president’s power but rarely constitute crimes. They should be forcefully condemned for signalling that corruption and cruelty are permissible, even rewarded in America. Future presidents should strengthen the standards for their own grants of clemency and take seriously their duty, in the Supreme Court’s words, to preserve the nation’s “confidence that [a president] will not abuse” the pardon power. But the only real bulwark against these sorts of pardons — short of amending the constitution to remove the power to issue them — is to avoid electing rotten presidents.

Mr Trump’s grants of clemency to close advisers Paul Manafort and Roger Stone belong to a distinct and far more dangerous category. These pardons appear to be the latest steps taken which may in effect have hindered inquiries into crimes that Mr Trump’s close associates have been convicted of committing. Put plainly, these pardons could potentially amount to criminal obstruction of justice or bribery.

Fear that a president might abuse the pardon power to obstruct justice is anything but novel. At the 1788 Virginia convention to ratify the constitution, George Mason worried that the president might use the power to “pardon crimes . . . advised by himself.” He also predicted that prospective pardons could be used as obstructive tools to “stop inquiry and prevent detection”.

But James Madison rejoined that there would be swift impeachment and removal for any president misusing the pardon power. Mr Trump has already been impeached — although the Republican controlled Senate voted not to remove him from office. The odds of a second impeachment before Joe Biden’s inauguration are slim to none. But the constitution expressly contemplates another solution — post-presidency criminal prosecution — saying that an impeached president “shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment, and Punishment, according to Law”.

Pardons used as a means of obstructing justice are integral parts of criminal conduct precisely because the president has the formal power to grant them. The very breadth of that power enables a president to deploy it as a tool of criminality. If pardons used to reward silence could be invalidated by the courts, they would be worthless to their recipients and useless in a scheme to interfere with a formal inquiry.

The result is not to negate the pardons issued but to expose a president to prosecution for the way he deployed them. If Mr Trump abuses pardons to shield himself and key allies from justice, that could be charged as criminal obstruction of justice, an abuse of the constitutional power of clemency to accomplish an illegal end.

In a poetic turn of justice, such obstructive pardons would make prosecuting a president who granted them easier. If Messrs Manafort and Stone and former national security adviser Michael Flynn were called to testify against Mr Trump, their pardons would make it much harder for them to invoke their constitutional rights to remain silent to avoid self-incrimination.

If Mr Trump has used his pardon power to commit crimes, he must be prosecuted; failing to do so would set a perilous precedent for future administrations. In future investigations of presidential misconduct, essential witnesses might routinely protect the boss in hopes of (or in exchange for) immunity. Worse yet, future presidents could treat their terms in office as four-year licences to commit heinous crimes with impunity. As Mason worried in 1788, the president would have “establish[ed] a monarchy, and destroy[ed] the republic.”

There still remains the possibility that Mr Trump might try pardoning himself. But, as Richard Nixon’s justice department opined in 1974, a self-pardon is not within the president’s constitutional power. A self-pardon twists the text of the constitution — one doesn’t “grant” things to oneself — and violates the centuries-old tenet that nobody can be trusted to judge his own case. It would also liberate every president to ignore federal criminal laws while in office, placing the holder functionally outside the law.

Perhaps the only way to limit this potential misuse of the pardon power would be to prosecute an ex-president who tries to use it on himself. If Mr Trump seeks to pardon himself, the next attorney-general must zealously investigate him and prosecute any federal crimes that are uncovered. Forgiveness may be divine, but it cannot vindicate misbehaviour. Democracy and the rule of law demand that we hold everyone to account."	left

kskuxf	liberal	Nancy Pelosi Calls for Trump’s Removal, Says Congress May Pursue Impeachment	"Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called on Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment, which allows for the removal of President Trump if he is unable to discharge his duties.

If they fail to do so, she said the Congress “may be prepared to move forward with impeachment” against Trump for instigating rioters to attack the Capitol building on Wednesday.

“In calling for this seditious act, the president has committed an unspeakable assault on our nation and our people,” Pelosi said. She called Trump “a very dangerous person who should not continue in office.”

The pro-Trump rioters clashed with Capitol police officers, smashed windows and trashed offices. One woman was shot and killed by a Capitol police officer, and it took several hours for order to be restored. More than 50 officers were injured in the melee, and several were hospitalized with serious injuries.

Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer earlier on Thursday called for the invocation of the 25th Amendment. Schumer said that if they failed to act, Congress should reconvene and impeach him. Several House Democrats were circulating articles of impeachment on Thursday morning.

Trump had addressed the crowd before the riot, urging them to march on the Capitol in order to put pressure on Republican senators who were unwilling to overturn the presidential election.

This comes less than two weeks before Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be inaugurated as president and vice president.

In the early hours of Thursday morning, the joint session of Congress completed the job of certifying Biden and Harris as the winners of the 2020 election. The two houses twice convened in separate sessions to consider objections to the electoral count in Arizona and Pennsylvania. After debate, both objections were defeated by overwhelming margins in the Senate and narrower margins in the House.

Meanwhile, the FBI and local police were reviewing video in an effort to identify and prosecute those who trespassed in the Capitol building.

Trump was impeached in December 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, after pressuring the Ukrainian president to announce a corruption investigation of Biden’s son. In that case, he was acquitted by the Senate, with all Republicans except Sen. Mitt Romney voting to acquit on both charges."	left
ljwrz6	liberal	FBI Informant Panic Is Ruining Friendships All Over the Far Right	"As federal authorities crack down on the far right after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, the movement’s leaders have found new sources of suspicion: each other.

In the Trumpist “America First” movement and the far-right paramilitary group the Proud Boys, alliances are fracturing as extremists brand each other as potential informants. Now racist live-streamers are accusing their former comrades of attempting to turn over followers to law enforcement, while Proud Boys chapters are splintering from the national organization over similar fears.

Until the FBI started closing in, white nationalists Nick Fuentes and Patrick Casey were the two most prominent figures in the racist “America First” movement.

The pair built up shared audiences on live-streaming platforms, and cheered as their fans, nicknamed “groypers” after an obese version of the cartoon Pepe the Frog, heckled more moderate Trump allies at conservative events.

But the federal heat is on after Fuentes received roughly $250,000 in a much-scrutinized bitcoin transfer, then appeared outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 riot. The FBI is reportedly investigating the bitcoin transfer, though Fuentes has not faced charges over the money or the riot.

On Thursday, Casey distanced himself from Fuentes and America First in a live-streamed video, slamming Fuentes’ decision to gather his followers in Orlando later this month for a conference right as other America First supporters face charges over the riot.

“Some people who were at the Capitol are going to flip,” Casey said in his video.

Declaring the aftermath of the Capitol riot “a million times worse” for the far right than the crackdown that followed the fatal white supremacist rally in Charlottesville in 2017, Casey claimed, without offering evidence, that Fuentes’ bank accounts have been frozen by federal authorities. He also accused Fuentes of planning to drive cross-country, rather than fly, to the Florida conference because he suspected he was on the federal no-fly list, then concealing that possibility from his followers.

Worst of all, Casey argued, Fuentes planned to gather all of his supporters in Orlando, where they could be easily recorded by federal investigators or informants. He went on to suggest America First’s members would see the conference for what he thinks it could be: an FBI trap.

“He wants you to give him your real name, to show up to his event where your face will be visible, where your cellphone data will be in close proximity to his,” Casey said.

Fuentes didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Accusations that one-time allies have become federal informants aren’t uncommon in the extreme right, which has built up an entire lexicon of terms to describe the varieties of real or suspected federal infiltrators. But that paranoia has been ratcheted up in the aftermath of the riot, with the Proud Boys—a group that has seen a slew of members indicted—splintering under accusations that leaders have become informants or otherwise been compromised by the FBI.

Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio was arrested in Washington, D.C., two days before the riot, and now faces felony charges over the possession of illicit firearm magazines. But a Reuters report on Tarrio’s history as a federal informant cast members’ suspicions on their own leader, even as Proud Boys who allegedly participated in the riot face federal conspiracy charges.

Proud Boys chapters in three U.S. states—including four local chapters in Indiana—now claim to have broken with the national organization over Tarrio’s work as a federal informant. (Tarrio did not return a request for comment.)

“We reject and disavow the proven federal informant, Enrique Tarrio, and any and all chapters that choose to associate with him,” read a statement shared by the Indiana group’s state-level Telegram channel and on the Alabama group’s website, previously reported by USA Today. “We do not recognize the assumed authority of any national Proud Boy leadership including the Chairman, the Elders, or any subsequent governing body that is formed to replace them until such a time we may choose to consent to join those bodies of government.”

Proud Boys in Oklahoma also broke from Tarrio’s leadership, issuing a statement on messaging app Telegram in which they accused him and other national “elders” of “failure to take disciplinary measures [which] have jeopardized our brothers safety and the integrity of our brotherhood.”

Tarrio responded to the Oklahoma chapter’s departure with a series of memes accusing Oklahomans of being rednecks, or having sex with relatives. Anti-Tarrio Proud Boys responded with their own memes accusing their former leader of ratting out members of the group, photoshopping his face on rapper and government witness Tekashi69. Another meme played on the menacing Proud Boys motto “Fuck Around and Find Out,” claiming that Tarrio would instead “Snitch Around and Rat Out.”

But don’t expect Proud Boy splinter groups to morph into peaceful book clubs. The Indiana Proud Boys, for example, are led by Brien James, a longtime member of white supremacist groups with a history of violent brawls. Other white supremacists have previously slammed James as a law enforcement risk (someone “you want to keep away from you because you know he’s going to do something to bring the cops over,” one previously noted). Nevertheless, James took to Telegram this week to blame Tarrio and Ethan “Rufio Panman” Nordean, a prominent Proud Boy who was arrested on Feb. 3 over his own alleged role in the riot, of being untrustworthy.

“ He claimed he’d tried to transfer the trademark to another Proud Boy, who got spooked after Canada slapped the group with a terrorist label. ”

“Now we have another ‘war boy’ and elder who is trying to snitch on the president? For something he knows damn well the president didn’t do? You made your own choices Rufio,” James wrote, adding that “if you are a Proud Boy I would recommend having your chapter declare full autonomy from the national structure at the very least.” (A public defender listed as representing Nordean did not respond to a request for comment.)

The Capitol riots have been followed by still more rifts internationally.

Anti-fascist activists in Manitoba, Canada, also claim their province’s Proud Boys chapter has dissolved. The CBC reported that, while the chapter had been largely inactive for the past year, the group was confirmed dead this month, when the Canadian government designated Proud Boys as a terrorist organization.

Meanwhile, Jason Lee Van Dyke, who registered the group’s trademark and briefly led the Proud Boys in 2018, filed this week to surrender the trademark to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, legal documents show. Van Dyke previously told The Daily Beast he revoked Tarrio’s license to use the name after a Black church in Washington, D.C., sued the Proud Boys for allegedly burning their flag in a rally weeks before the Capitol attack.

“I don’t want any recourse or anyone thinking I have any control over this group, that I have anything to do with this group, or that I am going to have anything to do with this group in the future,” Van Dyke said in a separate interview this week. He claimed he’d tried to transfer the trademark to another Proud Boy, who got spooked after Canada slapped the group with a terrorist label.

“There was one individual… who contacted me about having the trademark transferred to him,” Van Dyke told The Daily Beast. “After the Canadian government made a determination of the Proud Boys as a terrorist group for whatever reason they did that, that individual told me he was out and he would not be taking over the trademark. My response to that individual and those who had been working with him on acquiring the trademark was that they had seven days to get back to me regarding who was going to take it over, or I was going to surrender it.

“I did not hear back from anybody and the trademark is surrendered.”

As for the America First movement, Casey’s criticism of Fuentes has riled the “groypers,” who have been forced to choose between their two leaders. Fuentes appeared to respond to Casey on Thursday night by tweeting a video of Donald Trump talking about disloyalty.

But Fuentes’ supporters and allies have good reason to believe federal law enforcement is focusing on their group. Anthime Gionet, a Fuentes ally who goes by the alias “Baked Alaska,” was arrested in January after filming himself entering the Capitol. Riot suspect Riley June Williams, who wore an “I’m With Groyper” shirt to the Capitol, allegedly stole a laptop computer from Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).

Casey urged his followers to consider how they would react to Fuentes’ conference if any other far-right leader had been behind it.

“You would be like, ‘Wow, federal honeypot, federal honeypot event,’” Casey said. “You would probably accuse the guy of being a fed.”"	left
kiezif	liberal	Mitch McConnell Successfully Blocked Mandatory Paid Leave For Workers With COVID. Congress did not extend the paid leave mandate in its $900 billion COVID aid bill. Democrats hope to try again next year.	"The journalists at BuzzFeed News are proud to bring you trustworthy and relevant reporting about the coronavirus. To help keep this news free, become a member and sign up for our newsletter, Incoming .

WASHINGTON — Employers will no longer have to provide paid sick leave to workers who get infected with COVID-19 after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked that extension from being included in Congress’s latest coronavirus aid package.

In March, Congress passed a law mandating that workers are able to draw two weeks of paid sick leave if they contract COVID, two weeks of paid leave to care for a quarantining relative, and up to 10 weeks of paid family leave to care for a child whose school or daycare is closed for COVID-related reasons.

BuzzFeed News previously reported that McConnell was pushing to block the paid leave mandate from being extended. Congressional aides in both parties confirmed Monday that the extension was left out of the aid bill as a concession to McConnell.

The bill does extend a refundable tax credit that fully subsidizes the cost to businesses of paying out sick leave until the end of March. Essentially, the federal government will continue to foot the bill for businesses that offer paid leave over the next three months, but it will be optional for businesses to opt into this program and let their employees take time off.

The bill is set to pass on Monday night and President Donald Trump is expected to sign it into law soon thereafter.

The United States is an outlier in not requiring any form of paid sick leave. The Center for Economic and Policy Research analyzed the sick leave policies of 22 wealthy nations and found that the US was the only country without some form of paid sick leave.

The paid leave mandate had already been watered down in the March bill. Big businesses with over 500 employees were exempt from the requirement, while businesses with under 50 employees could apply for exemptions."	left
k4lnqd	liberal	Biden readies major stimulus push and flurry of executive actions in first 100 days	"(CNN) President-elect Joe Biden and his transition team are preparing for an early, all-out push to pass an ambitious new stimulus bill, while also drawing up plans for a flurry of executive actions aimed at delivering on campaign promises and undoing the Trump administration's efforts to undermine key government agencies.

Biden will be inaugurated in January with a pressing mandate to confront simultaneous and interwoven public health, economic and racial crises. At the same time, his team will take over the work of spearheading one of the most complicated, politically fraught mass vaccination campaigns in American history.

Biden's agenda for his first 100 days in office will, according to both those close to him and outside groups in contact with his top aides, center on two key avenues of action: the passage of a broad economic aid package and, where legislation is not necessary, a series of executive actions aimed at advancing his priorities. Containing the Covid-19 pandemic, launching an economic recovery and tackling racial inequality are his most urgent priorities, transition officials say.

The scope of stimulus legislation will likely turn on the results of the Senate run-offs in Georgia in early January, a little more than two weeks before Biden is inaugurated. If either Democrat fails to unseat their GOP incumbent rivals, and the body remains under the thumb of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican, Biden's ambitions will be checked from the outset. The immigration legislation Biden said he plans to send to the Congress within his first 100 days would likely be dead on arrival.

But sources familiar with internal discussions stressed that getting a grip on the surging coronavirus crisis is far and away Biden's top concern. Until that happens, one of the sources said, the President-elect's wider legislative agenda is likely to take a backseat.

The realities of a divided Washington, or one where Democrats hold the slim congressional majorities, mean any big legislative initiative will either need some bipartisan support or demand uniform Democratic backing, further complicate the road ahead. Biden is planning an announcement sometime in December to spell out his priorities to the public, according to a source involved in the plans.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration and its allies have sought to plant a minefield of complications for its successor. A Trump nominee slow-walked the formal process for allowing Biden's team to engage with government officials. And Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin demanded the Federal Reserve return unused funds from an emergency lending program to Congress, leading the Fed to issue a rare public protest.

The executive options

Biden has a wider berth when it comes to executive orders.

His transition team has spent months thinking through the unilateral actions Biden could take almost immediately upon entering the White House. No final decisions have been made on specific steps, but a transition official said Biden will consider using the many ""levers at his disposal.""

In an interview with NBC News last week , Biden singled out the stimulus package -- and committed to making sure it targets the most vulnerable communities and includes aid to cash-strapped state and local governments.

""There's multiple things that are going to be taking place at the same time,"" Biden said. ""But the most important thing, I think, is to focus on those folks, who are always, when crisis hits, are the first ones hit -- and recovery comes to last.""

Health care workers and first responders, he said, should be the first in line to take a Covid vaccine once one is authorized for use and distribution channels open up.

But Biden acknowledged that a good deal of his agenda could come to ""depend on the kind of cooperation I can or cannot get from the United States Congress.""

He cited his commitment to send legislation with a pathway to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants to the Senate, but also said he was poised to immediately roll back some of Trump's ""very damaging"" executive actions, in particular those related to the climate.

Some of that can be accomplished by fiat, Biden's campaign said before the election, spelling out a series of measures that would bring down emissions, up public investment in clean energy and incentivize private innovation.

But the scale of the climate agenda agreed to by the Biden-Sanders ""unity task forces"" will require legislation, too. How that takes shape remains to be seen -- and, like so many other questions facing the transition, could hinge on the outcome in Georgia.

Many leading climate activists have long believed that any significant investment in a transition from fossil fuels will need to be baked into an expansive economic stimulus bill. By this summer, after engaging publicly and privately with Biden's campaign, they came away with a cautious optimism that the President-elect's team was ""coming around"" to a similar understanding.

Some of the most notable early work of the Biden administration-in-waiting, which is coming together at breakneck speed with the rollout of nominees to influential cabinet posts and announcement hires to senior White House posts, will take place outside the Oval Office. Trump officials have gutted or hamstrung agencies whose charters clash with the President's long-running efforts to crush what his former chief strategist derisively labeled ""the administrative state.""

That means an early effort, Biden indicated in his NBC News interview, to rebuild the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA, he said, has been ""eviscerated"" by Trump.

There is also a growing push for the new administration to make an early splash by using executive power to forgive student loan debt. Biden has called on Congress to pass relief to borrowers, but a plan promoted by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren argues that Biden could, with the stroke of his pen, cancel as much as $50,000 per person.

The to-do list

The to-do list is a long one: Biden during the campaign pledged to make the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act an early priority. As part of that, he pledged to direct federal resources to combat violence against transgender women, with a specific mind to transgender women of color.

He has also assured the labor movement that he would reengage with government workers' unions.

""On Biden's first day in office, he will restore federal employees' rights to organize and bargain collectively,"" read the pledge on Biden's campaign website, ""and will direct his agencies to bargain with federal employee unions over non-mandatory subjects of bargaining.""

The shadow of Trump's tenure looms over much of the early Biden agenda.

The President has repeatedly leaned on the Justice Department to take up his political causes. Biden during the campaign promised to resurrect the barriers between top elected officials and staff and senior prosecutors.

The first step, his campaign said, would come through the issuance of an executive order ""directing that no White House staff or any member of his administration may initiate, encourage, obstruct, or otherwise improperly influence specific DOJ investigations or prosecutions for any reason.""

Anyone from the administration found to be in violation of that code would be fired.

A number of Biden's domestic priorities overlap with his desire to reengage with other leading powers on the world stage. His ""day one"" agenda includes a promise to immediately rejoin the Paris Climate Accord and World Health Organization -- both of which were dumped by Trump.

Biden's international climate docket includes the convening of a ""world summit"" that could potentially build on and seek out more ambitious ground than the what was agreed in Paris.

Trying to resurrect the Iran nuclear deal will be a knottier proposition, one made all the more difficult by the recent assassination of country's top nuclear scientist -- a killing Tehran has blamed on Israel."	left

A petition urging Walmart and Amazon to stop selling MyPillow's products passed 100,000 signatures.

MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, a Trump ally, continues to push voter-fraud conspiracy theories.

At least 22 retailers have already cut ties with the company, including Sam's Club and Kohl's.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

A petition urging retailers including Walmart and Amazon to stop selling products from MyPillow, whose CEO, Mike Lindell, keeps pushing voter-fraud conspiracy theories, has hit 100,000 signatures.

Lindell told Insider on Thursday that at least 22 retailers had cut ties with his pillow company since January, including Sam's Club, Kohl's, and Bed Bath & Beyond — but MyPillow's products are still selling on the websites of some retailers, including Walmart and Amazon.

The petition urges retailers to stop selling MyPillow's products. Its description says: ""We will not support funding insurrectionists!""

This is a reference to the January 6 siege of the US Capitol, when rioters stormed the building in an attempt to disrupt the certification of the 2020 presidential election. Lindell, a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, spread misinformation about the riot and claimed that some rioters may have been ""plants.""

On Wednesday morning, the petition had nearly 103,000 signatures.

Newsweek first reported on the news. Amazon, Walmart, and MyPillow did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Insider.

James Lanigan created the Change.org petition on January 15, after Lindell met with Trump on Trump's last Friday in office.

Read more: The MyPillow guy says God helped him beat a crack addiction to build a multimillion-dollar empire. Now his religious devotion to Trump threatens to bring it all crashing down.

The meeting went viral after a Washington Post photographer took a photo of their meeting notes, which mentioned ""martial law"" and ""foreign interference in the election."" The meeting was held just over a week after the January 6 siege.

The petition initially called on Bed Bath & Beyond to pull MyPillow's products, too, but the retailer told Insider on January 19 that it would cut ties with the brand.

""We have been rationalizing our assortment to discontinue a number of underperforming items and brands,"" a representative said. ""This includes the My Pillow product line.""

During an appearance on ""The Domenick Nati Show"" in mid-March, Lindell said retailers who said they'd cut ties because of slow sales were ""lying"" and were ""big losers.""

Lindell also said calls for retailers to stop selling his products came from bots and trolls, adding that the companies who kept stocking MyPillow were ""thriving.""

Lindell told Insider that he expected retailers pulling MyPillow's products to cost the company about $65 million in lost revenue this year but that radio and podcast infomercials could plug the gap by driving more direct sales.

""I'm very confident that the radio and podcasts are going to make up a lot of the lost box-store revenue and retailers,"" Lindell said Thursday.

But analysts told Insider that by relying on infomercials, the company may restrict its audience — and its sales.

hjben5	liberal	Biden attacks Republicans for blocking law on foreign election interference	"(Reuters) - Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s campaign on Tuesday criticized U.S. Senate Republicans for blocking legislation to require campaigns to report offers of foreign election help to the FBI, saying it could open the door to interference in the 2020 contest.

Senator Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Republicans had stripped language he added to an intelligence bill intended to prevent actions like those by Russia that U.S. intelligence services concluded were an attempt to undercut Republican President Donald Trump’s rival in the 2016 campaign.

“This action today can only raise questions about partisan motivation in leaving open the channels for hostile foreign government intervention in our election process,” Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement.

U.S. law already makes it illegal for campaigns to accept anything of value from foreign sources. Warner’s measure would have compelled them to disclose any offers of aid from a foreign national.

Warner said Republican leaders removed the provision ahead of a Senate debate on the intelligence bill, which is being incorporated into the annual National Defense Authorization Act that sets defense policy.

A spokesman for Senator Marco Rubio, the intelligence committee’s interim chair, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Multiple U.S. intelligence agencies found that Russia acted to help Trump, a charge that Russia denies and Trump has repeatedly labeled a “hoax.”

Bates also noted recent reports that the Trump administration took no action against Russia despite intelligence suggesting it paid bounties to Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops.

Trump has said he was not briefed on the bounty allegations.

Warner first introduced the legislation last year after Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference. The measure was then blocked by Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn, who called it a “stunt.”"	left
mtcyhn	liberal	Most Americans want to end lifetime Supreme Court appointments: poll	"Sign up for our PoliticsNY newsletter for the latest coverage and to stay informed about the 2021 elections in your district and across NYC

By Chris Kahn, Reuters

A majority of Americans want to end lifetime appointments for U.S. Supreme Court justices, according to an Ipsos poll for Reuters, though less than half are in favor of other efforts to reform the judiciary.

The national opinion poll, conducted on Thursday and Friday, found that 63% of adults supported term or age limits for Supreme Court justices. Another 22% said they opposed any limits and the rest did not express an opinion.

The poll also found that only 38% would support expanding the size of the court by adding four more justices. Another 42% said they would oppose doing so and the rest were unsure.

Liberal activists and some legal scholars have been pushing for judicial reforms as Republican leaders in Congress built a 6-to-3 conservative Supreme Court majority over the past several years, in part by blocking a Democratic nominee and allowing Republican former President Donald Trump to install three picks during his single term.

Some Democratic lawmakers on Thursday introduced legislation to expand the Supreme Court to 13 justices, a move that they believe would restore public confidence in the judicial branch. But the party’s leadership appeared cool to the idea of pursuing that course.

President Joe Biden has formed a bi-partisan committee to look at the merits of adding justices as well as other potential reforms to the court.

While Congress has the power to change the number of justices who sit on the court, legal scholars believe it would likely require a constitutional amendment to end their lifetime appointments.

The poll found that only 49% of Americans have a “great deal” or a “fair amount” of confidence in decisions made by Supreme Court justices. In comparison, 43% of respondents expressed a similar amount of trust in decisions made by the White House and 32% said the same of decisions made by Congress.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. The survey gathered responses from 1,003 adults. The results have a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 4 percentage points."	left
m2f6ne	liberal	GOP Senator Who Voted Against COVID-19 Relief Already Taking Credit For Bill's Benefits	"Caroline Brehman-Pool/Getty Images Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) touted the COVID-19 relief bill's aid to restaurant owners, even though he voted against the package.

Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) tweeted on Wednesday that independent restaurant operators were going to get billions of dollars coming their rescue, thanks to the COVID-19 relief bill about to become law.

Shortly after Democrats in Congress passed President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief legislation, a Republican senator was already trying to take some credit for the popular bill ― even though he and every single other Republican voted against it.

Independent restaurant operators have won $28.6 billion worth of targeted relief. This funding will ensure small businesses can survive the pandemic by helping to adapt their operations and keep their employees on the payroll. https://t.co/Ob4pRb9Xh4

The House passed the relief legislation Wednesday, in a 220-211 vote. One Democrat (Maine’s Rep. Jared Golden) voted with every single Republican in voting no. It also passed along party lines in the Senate. It now heads to Biden’s desk for his signature.

Polling has found that a majority of the public ― including Republicans ― supports the legislation, despite the staunch opposition of GOP lawmakers. So perhaps it was only a matter of time until those same lawmakers started trying to reap the benefits of the bill.

When reporters on the Hill asked Wicker about his tweet and the fact that he also voted against the bill on Wednesday, he said it was a “stupid question.”

“One good provision in a $1.9 trillion bill doesn’t mean I have to vote for the whole thing,” Wicker replied.

“I was for that bill, introduced that bill, long, long before this legislation,” Wicker added when pressed on whether he was taking credit for the Democrats’ work.

An aide to Wicker noted that he is the author of the Restaurants Act, which would provide a $120 billion relief fund to help independent restaurants and small franchises.

“He was not able to support $2 trillion in poorly targeted spending as was proposed by Congressional Democrats,” the aide said. “He will continue working to advance targeted relief for restaurants and other groups that have been hit hard by the pandemic.”

A similar pattern happened after the 2009 stimulus, when GOP lawmakers who voted against President Barack Obama’s legislation then went back into their home districts and took credit for the money that flowed to their constituents. At the time, ThinkProgress counted 114 Republican lawmakers who blocked the bill while touting its benefits. They sent out press releases taking credit for money that funded projects in their district, even though they voted against it.

“I have to point out, though, that some of the very same folks in Congress who opposed the Recovery Act ― and claim that it hasn’t worked ― have been all too happy to claim credit for Recovery Act projects and the jobs those projects have produced,” Obama said in 2010. “They come to the ribbon-cuttings and ― they found a way to have their cake and vote against it, too.”

hwi1af	liberal	Brooke Baldwin Asks Why Trump Isn't Sending Well Wishes To Epstein Victims	"CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin on Wednesday posed a question to President Donald Trump in response to his shocking comments about Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite accused of enabling her former boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse young women.

On Tuesday, when Trump was asked during a news briefing about Maxwell’s arrest and whether she might implicate any powerful men involved in Epstein’s inner circle, the president said: “I don’t know. I haven’t really been following it too much. I just wish her well, frankly. I’ve met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach.”

Baldwin was aghast. “Maxwell is facing federal charges. She is accused of recruiting, grooming and sexually abusing young girls as part of a yearslong criminal enterprise,” she told viewers. “And their stories are so abhorrent I can’t even go into some of the detail on national television.”

She noted there were some important women the president “left off his well-wishes list”:

“How about wishing well alleged victim Annie Farmer, who said ‘the danger Maxwell poses must be taken seriously?’ How about wishing well anonymous Jane Doe who said ‘Without Ghislaine, Jeffrey could not have done what he did.’ How about wishing well Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who claims that Epstein kept her as a teenage sex slave, and that he was able to keep her with the assistance of Ghislaine Maxwell? How about wishing well the women whose younger years were allegedly stolen, whose lives are forever scarred, whose futures they hope will see justice?”

Maxwell, 58, was arrested this month in connection with Epstein’s sexual abuse of several underage girls between 1994 and 1997. She faces six felony charges, including conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, enticement and transportation of a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, and perjury. She has pleaded not guilty.

Her arrest came nearly one year after authorities arrested Epstein, who died of apparent suicide in August after he was denied bail.

“Whatever they end up doing, or not doing, none of it will compare to one of the lowest points of American democracy that we lived through in January 2021,"" Boehner John Andrew BoehnerHouse Republicans request hearing with Capitol Police Board for first time since 1945 Press: John Boehner: good author, bad leader Juan Williams: A breakthrough on immigration? MORE wrote in a new book set to be published this month, excerpts of which were obtained by The New York Times.

The former Speaker also wrote that Trump “incited that bloody insurrection for nothing more than selfish reasons, perpetuated by the bullshit he’d been shoveling since he lost a fair election the previous November.”

Boehner said it was ""painful"" for him to watch what unfolded at the Capitol on Jan. 6 and the incident ""should have been a wake-up call for a return to Republican sanity.”

The former Speaker wrote Trump's refusal to accept the result of the 2020 presidential election ""not only cost Republicans the Senate but led to mob violence.""



“I’ll admit I wasn’t prepared for what came after the election — Trump refusing to accept the results and stoking the flames of conspiracy that turned into violence in the seat of our democracy, the building over which I once presided,"" Boehner wrote.



In a statement to the Times, Trump called Boehner a RINO — short for ""Republican in name only"" — and suggested he was drunk when he was writing his book. In teasing his audiobook release earlier this year, Boehner, a well-documented wine connoisseur, posted a photograph of him drinking merlot while recording.



""Was he drinking when he made this statement?"" Trump, who does not drink, asked. ""Just another RINO who couldn’t do the job!”



In an essay adapted from his book that was published Friday by Politico Magazine, Boehner defended former President Obama from criticism that he didn't work hard enough to reach bipartisan consensus with Republicans during his time in office.



""How do you find common cause with people who think you are a secret Kenyan Muslim traitor?"" the former Speaker asked.



Boehner also attacked leading members of the Tea Party, who he has referred to as ""legislative terrorists"" and Fox News for peddling what he called false outrage and stoking political divisions on the right.



“Some of the people involved did not surprise me in the least,"" Boehner said of Jan. 6 and the ensuing rhetoric from Republicans around election security and the Capitol riot. ""The legislative terrorism that I’d witnessed as Speaker had now encouraged actual terrorism.”"	left
lmry47	liberal	Texas mayor resigns after telling residents he owed them ‘nothing’ following storm power outage	"The mayor of a Texas town who told residents he owed them “nothing” as winter storms left millions across the state without power in single digit temperatures has resigned.

“No one owes you [or] your family anything,” Tim Boyd, previously mayor of Colorado City, Texas wrote Tuesday in a Facebook post. “I’m sick and tired of people looking for a damn handout!”

He has since deleted the post.

In a second post, Mr Boyd said he “won’t deny for one minute” anything he said in the previous post, but complained that his wife had faced harassment while adding that he had resigned from his position.

Mr Boyd said he made the comments as a “private citizen,” and that he had resigned his position days earlier. He is still listed as mayor on the city’s website, and city council agendas cite him as mayor as recently as last week, according to The Washington Post.

The former mayor said his wife was fired from her job due to his statement, and complained that his family was subject to “undeserved” harassment and death threats.

The Facebook screed was shared widely on social media and was reported on by numerous news outlets.

In his initial post, Mr Boyd said people waiting in their homes to have their power restored were “lazy” and said that the “strong will survive and the weak will [perish].”

But residents in the region were anything but lazy; residents had banded together to help support each other by walking through the snow to deliver supplies. Others had opened up their private wells to provide water for those who had lost services.

Mr Boyd’s tirade toward people he thinks are “too lazy to get up and fend for themselves” blamed the “socialist government”.

It was not immediately clear which government Mr Boyd was referring to, since he led the local government, and Republicans under Donald Trump ran the country for the last four years.

Texas’ inability to provide uninterrupted utility service to millions of residents is partly due to the state’s decision to operate its own power grid in an effort to avoid federal regulation.

By Tuesday, at least 10 people had died from the winter storms in the state. Another winter storm is expected to hit the region on Wednesday."	left
iuro5u	liberal	Pence's former lead coronavirus task force aide slams Trump and endorses Biden in new video	"Washington (CNN) A former top aide to Vice President Mike Pence assailed President Donald Trump's response to the pandemic in a new video Thursday, adding to the growing list of former Trump administration officials who have criticized the President and, in several cases, endorsed his Democratic opponent Joe Biden.

Olivia Troye, who was a homeland security adviser to Pence and his lead staffer on the White House's coronavirus task force, charged in the two-minute video that Trump failed to protect the American public because he only cared about himself and getting reelected. Troye's criticism is particularly striking because of her role working on the coronavirus task force, which Pence leads.

""Towards the middle of February, we knew it wasn't a matter of if Covid would become a big pandemic here, it was a matter of when,"" said Troye, who left the White House in late July. ""But the President didn't want to hear that, because his biggest concern was that we were in an election year, and how was this going to affect what he considered to be his record of success?""

At one coronavirus task force meeting, Troye claimed that Trump suggested ""maybe this Covid thing is a good thing.""

""I don't like shaking hands with people. I don't have to shake hands with these disgusting people,"" Troye claimed Trump said at the meeting.

The White House responded swiftly to Troye's allegations by accusing her of being a disgruntled employee who didn't raise objections while on staff.

Trump told reporters on Thursday evening that he did not know Troye, but claimed she had been goaded into making her statement.

""(T)he people get a hold of her and say, 'Let's say some bad things about Donald Trump,' "" Trump said.

He added, ""Every time somebody leaves government -- 99% of the time I'm not going to know these people. And they leave on a basis of almost like it's a personal thing with me.""

Pence also slammed his former aide.

""I haven't read her comments in any detail, but it reads to me like one more disgruntled employee who's left the White House and now has decided to play politics during an election year,"" Pence said of Troye, in response to a question from a reporter. ""I think my staff has indicated that she made no comments like that when she was serving on our team here at the White House coronavirus task force.""

Pence added he ""couldn't be more proud of the work we've done all along the way and the leadership that President Trump has provided.""

White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere said, ""Outside of generally watching the White House Coronavirus Taskforce from the overflow staff room, this disgruntled former detailee was never in private meetings with the President and her assertions have no basis in reality and are flat out inaccurate.""

And Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Pence's national security adviser, said in a statement Troye was ""disgruntled that her detail was cut short.""

""Ms. Troye directly reported to me, and never once during her detail did she every express any concern regarding the Administration's response to the Coronavirus to anyone in her chain of command,"" Kellogg said.

Troye's video was released by Republican Voters Against Trump, a GOP group seeking to defeat Trump in November. Troye has also joined a new anti-Trump group formed by Republicans, the Republican Political Alliance for Integrity and Reform, or REPAIR, which says it's seeking to ""refocus the Republican Party's priorities, and repair the American republic.""

The group announced more than two dozen advisers on Thursday, including Troye and several ex-Trump officials who worked in the Department of Homeland Security: former DHS general counsel John Mitnick, former assistant secretary Elizabeth Neumann and Miles Taylor, who was chief of staff to former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

Anthony Scaramucci, who was briefly White House communications director, and Josh Venable, who was chief of staff to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, are also part of the group.

Taylor, the group's co-founder and a CNN contributor, said that REPAIR is linked to Republican Voters Against Trump, but while that organization is focused on defeating Trump, REPAIR is not endorsing Biden and is looking to what comes after Trump leaves office.

""We will be the biggest group so far of former Trump administration officials who have come together to say we need to move past Donald Trump and move the party and the country beyond his presidency,"" Taylor said.

Republicans criticizing Trump is nothing new, and there have been GOP voices attacking him since his 2016 campaign began. Republican-led groups like the Lincoln Project are now actively campaigning against the President in 2020.

But in recent months there have been a growing number of officials who worked in the Trump administration and subsequently criticized the President. Former national security adviser John Bolton's book gave an unflattering portrait of Trump, and both former Defense Secretary James Mattis and former Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats offered brutal assessments of Trump in Bob Woodward's new book ""Rage.""

Several Republicans have gone even further and endorsed Biden, including Scaramucci, Neumann and Taylor.

Troye, who took a job at the National Insurance Crime Bureau when she left the Trump administration, endorsed Biden in the video released Thursday. She has worked at multiple federal agencies throughout her career on counterterrorism and intelligence issues, including for the vice president since 2018. She said that she decided to leave the administration because she felt her work wasn't making a difference thanks to Trump.

""Does it matter,"" she said, ""because no matter how hard you work and what you do, the President is going to do something that is detrimental to keeping Americans safe, which is why you signed up for this role?""

In her farewell email to colleagues, which was obtained by CNN, Troye wrote she had ""witnessed firsthand how dedicated and committed all of you have been to doing the right thing.""

""Thank you for entrusting me to be your rock during this hard time. I will always be rooting for you knowing that you will continue to fight the good fight,"" she said.

le1pw6	liberal	Marjorie Taylor Greene's loss of committee seats is a good first step. But she deserves expulsion.	"This is not something that I take lightly. But I believe that what Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., has done warrants her being expelled from Congress.

If you look at her behavior and comments — in the context of what had been going on in the country before Nov. 3, then after the elections, and finally during and after the insurrection that occurred on Jan. 6 — removing her from the committees is not enough. It's a great first step, because somebody who peddles in lies and conspiracy theories should not have a platform to try to influence the education policy of the United States. But it's not enough.

House Republicans removed Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, from his committees in the last Congress because he used inflammatory language and he was catering to white supremacists, but what she's done goes beyond that. She participated in inciting the insurrectionists who stormed the U.S. Capitol to overturn the results of a free and fair election, which is the cornerstone of our democracy. Five people were killed, including a Capitol Police officer who lay in state here on Wednesday.

And while there will be a motion to censure her — and I will likely support that when it comes to a vote — I also think that isn't responsive enough to the gravity of her actions. Members have been censured for using unparliamentary language, for the improper use of campaign funds, for filing incorrect financial disclosure statements — stuff like that. What she has done goes far beyond that; censuring her does not send a strong enough message to the country about how seriously the House of Representatives takes individuals who peddle in lies, who use the language of political violence and who try to incite violence in order to get their way in either electoral politics or in the legislative process.

And even after facing the possibility of punishment by the House, she hasn't apologized: instead, she blamed the backlash to her dangerous statements on cancel culture, simply affirmed the fact that 9/11 happened, that school shootings aren't all fake and said that, when it came to her embrace of the cult-like QAnon conspiracy theory, she had been ""allowed to believe things that weren't true,"" rather than take responsibility for her own embrace and promotion of the lies and misinformation.

Oh, and she used the controversy to fundraise for her re-election campaign and the National Republican Congressional Committee, while spreading more conspiracy theories about Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., via Twitter on Tuesday, as well as using falsehoods about Reps. Omar, Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., supposedly condoning violence (they did not) in a fundraising email on Wednesday.

I want people to be on record about which side of the line they stand on: Do they believe that people who incite political violence as a means to an end should be sitting in Congress, or not?

It's clear that, as long as she's in office, Rep. Greene can and will try to influence her hardest, most hard-core supporters — especially the ones that believe in the QAnon conspiracy theory, the white supremacist organizations like the Three Percenters — to intimidate other lawmakers. This is not only a concern we had in the past; it is clearly one we need to continue to have moving forward in the future.

She was on Jan. 6 and today remains a danger to her colleagues in the House and to the staff at the Capitol.

Expelling a member from Congress is not something that's done lightly; it's not something that's been done many times in the history of the United States House of Representatives. But I believe that, in this case, it is completely warranted. If a president can be impeached for inciting violence and inciting insurrection, a member of Congress can at least be removed from office.

Some people will, of course, say that she was elected by the people in her district, which is true. But if somebody committed a crime, we can make a decision as the House of Representatives that such an individual should not be sitting in Congress. That is completely the prerogative of the House, and it is within our bounds.

The threshold for removing any member is high; two-thirds is not an easy threshold to achieve. But I want people to be on record about which side of the line they stand on: Do they believe that people who incite political violence as a means to an end should be sitting in Congress, or not? Members need to be on the record about whether they think her behavior is acceptable, which is what this vote would do.

She was on Jan. 6 and today remains a danger to her colleagues in the House and to the staff at the Capitol.

It will be extremely difficult to get 67 or 70 Republicans to support it — we only got 11 Republicans to support removing her from her committee assignments on Thursday and 10 to vote to impeach Donald Trump in January — but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be done.

This is not about having a different point of view, and it's not about her being a conservative. I work with conservatives whenever I can (as long as I don't need to compromise my Democratic values), and I'm one of the most progressive members of Congress. But what Rep. Greene has done is beyond what should be the scope of political decorum, and it could be extremely dangerous.

There are, in fact, other members who are supportive of a resolution to expel her but are also deeply concerned with whether, if they signed on as a co-sponsor, it would that put them, their staff or their family in danger. When I announced my intention to introduce a resolution to expel her, I received a few death threats, almost from the get-go. This is the kind of support she attracts; this is the kind of behavior she continues to incite. I truly believe that she is a threat to the safety of other members and the institution. So, it is a big step, but it's something that needs to be done.

We need to be able to do our work without fearing for our lives.

As told to THINK editor Megan Carpentier, edited and condensed for clarity.

"COLUMBUS, Ohio — A directive that restricted Ohio counties to one ballot drop box in November was arbitrary and unreasonable, a county judge ruled Tuesday, delivering the Republican secretary of state in the presidential battleground another in a series of blows to his policies.

The office of Secretary of State Frank LaRose said he would soon appeal the decision by Franklin County Common Pleas Judge Richard Frye, assuming the judge follows through and invalidates the secretary’s drop-box order.

For now, Frye’s ruling doesn’t change anything, LaRose spokesperson Maggie Sheehan said in a written statement, “and the Secretary’s directive remains in place.”

Access to ballot drop boxes has become an urgent matter nationally, with in-person voting options restricted by the coronavirus pandemic and the efficiency and security of mail-in voting questioned amid cutbacks at the U.S. Postal Service.

It is often the largely Democratic urban counties — such as Cuyahoga, home to Cleveland — that look to expand the number of drop boxes. Cuyahoga must serve more than 860,000 registered voters with only a single drop box under LaRose’s order.

The Ohio Democratic Party and a coalition of voting rights group sued LaRose last month over the directive, calling it unconstitutional. It prohibited election boards from installing more than one drop box located at the county board of elections, effectively holding the boxes to the number lawmakers made available in Ohio’s presidential primary.

LaRose cited a state election law that says absentee ballots must be “delivered by mail or personally” to a voter’s county election director. He has said that he personally supports counties adding more drop boxes, but that he lacks the legal authority to expand the number beyond the one established in law.

But Frye said the wording of the law makes “deliver” ambiguous: “It does not squarely answer whether drop boxes are permitted, or if so how many boxes may be used, or where they may be located by a board of elections.”

Because the law is vague, Frye said, counties must be legally permitted to explore placing additional boxes.

“While the secretary has broad discretion to issue Directives and otherwise guide local boards of elections, his actions must be reasonable to be legally enforceable,” Frye wrote. “Wholly arbitrary rules are entitled to no deference.”

In response to the ruling, state Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper called for LaRose to rise to the occasion.

“It’s time for the Secretary of State to do what he has told the public and officials that he would do,” Pepper tweeted. “No more delays. No more appeals. No more wasted time.”

The drop box decision was the third issue to confront LaRose since Friday, when a county judge ordered him to allow voters to apply for absentee ballots for the November presidential election by electronic means, including by fax or email. That decision was stayed Saturday as an appeal proceeds.

On Monday, fellow Republicans on the powerful state Controlling Board voted against LaRose’s proposal to use funds from his office’s Business Services budget to pay for postage on every mail-in ballot in the state.

Meanwhile, in Wisconsin, election clerks across the presidential battleground state rushed to mail absentee ballots Tuesday, less than 24 hours after the state Supreme Court lifted a temporary freeze on sending them while it considered a legal challenge.

“Oh, we’re busy,” said Wendy Helgeson, the Town of Greenville clerk who also serves as president of the Wisconsin Municipal Clerks Association.

More than 1,850 clerks in municipalities big and small were working to meet a Thursday deadline in state law to mail ballots to the more than 1 million voters who had requested them so far. Absentee ballots can be requested until Oct. 29, but election officials have urged voters to act more quickly given the expected large numbers and delays with the mail."	left
mdfu6i	liberal	Biden blasts Republicans for suddenly caring about the national debt now that a Democrat's in the White House	"Biden said Republicans suddenly care about the national debt again, at a Thursday press conference.

""I love the fact they found this whole idea of concern about the federal budget. It's kind of amazing,"" he said.

Biden is expected to unveil a $3 trillion infrastructure plan next week.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

President Joe Biden took a swing at Republicans at his first press conference on Thursday, criticizing their opposition to more federal spending now that a Democrat is sitting in the White House.

""Did you hear them complain when they passed close to a $2 trillion Trump tax cut, 83% going to the top 1%?"" he asked, referring to the share of benefits that flowed to the wealthiest Americans under former President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cut (In 2018, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center projected 20.5% of the benefits would go to the top 1%).

That law passed via the reconciliation process, just as Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus did. The recent pandemic relief measure features expanded aid to parents, $1,400 direct payments to most taxpayers, and enhanced unemployment insurance.

He went on: ""I love the fact they found this whole idea of concern about the federal budget. It's kind of amazing. When the federal budget is saving people's lives, they don't think it's such a good idea.""

The remarks illustrate some of the challenges that Biden faces as he presses ahead with the rest of his domestic agenda. Fresh off his first major legislative victory with a $1.9 trillion stimulus law, the president is now expected to unveil a $3 trillion infrastructure plan on Wednesday, referring to it as his ""next major initiative.""

He said at the news conference he aims ""to rebuild the infrastructure, both physical and technological infrastructure in this country, so we that can compete and create significant numbers of really good-paying jobs.""

It includes an initial bill focused on roads, bridges, and climate-related spending. The other would be geared at human infrastructure, including measures like universal pre-K, free community college, and a renewal of periodic cash payments for parents.

Biden appears to be betting on a groundswell of public support for his next major push in Congress.

""I still think the majority of the American people don't like the fact we are now ranked 85th in the world in infrastructure,"" he said. ""The future rests on whether or not we have the best airports that can accommodate air travel, ports that you can get in and out quickly.""

However, Republicans are opposed to the tax hikes on multinational corporations and high-earning Americans that Democrats are seeking to finance it. ""I don't think there's going to be any enthusiasm on our side for a tax increase,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week at a press conference.

Earlier today, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told NPR that the central bank is more concerned about ensuring an economic recovery than the national debt. He acknowledged the path of the debt is unsustainable, but its current level isn't cause for major concern at this point."	left
mvodb3	liberal	'We did it': Biden celebrates U.S. hitting 200-million-dose milestone in his first 100 days	"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden announced a new tax credit Wednesday to reimburse small businesses that give workers paid time off to get vaccinated against Covid-19 as he touted reaching his goal of 200 million shots administered in his first 100 days.

The tax credit, which will be funded by the Covid-19 relief bill passed last month, will be available to businesses with fewer than 500 employees, allowing up to $511 a day for each employee. Biden called on all companies, regardless of size, to offer paid time off, and offer other incentives, such as gift cards or bonuses, to encourage employees to get vaccinated.

As the United States this week reached Biden’s goal of 200 million shots administered, vaccine supply is starting to outstrip demand in some areas. Even without the supply of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine, which is undergoing a safety review, the U.S. has been shipping out more doses than are being used in recent weeks, a senior administration official told reporters Wednesday.

The U.S. had administered 199,426,628 as of April 21, according to an NBC News tracker, well on pace with eight days remaining to reach his goal for the first 100 days.

Biden said the country is entering a new phase in its vaccination efforts as it starts to shift its focus from getting the vaccine to those most at risk to the general population.

""The time is now to open up a new phase of this historic vaccination effort,"" he said. ""To put it simply, if you've been waiting for your turn, wait no longer. Now's the time for everyone over 16 years of age to get vaccinated.""

While some people are resistant to getting the vaccine because of safety concerns, others feel less urgency about getting vaccinated because they are younger and need a simpler process with fewer obstacles and some encouragement, the administration official said. The paid time off effort is aimed at addressing those concerns.

""No working American should lose a single dollar from their paycheck because they chose to fulfill their patriotic duty of getting vaccinated,"" Biden said.

He said he is giving serious consideration to sending some of the doses to other countries, including Canada and Central America, once he is confident there is enough supply to meet demand from Americans. He said he spent a half hour talking to the Canadian prime minister Wednesday about sending additional doses there.

""It's in process, we don't have enough confidence to send abroad now, but I expect we're gonna be able to,"" Biden said."	left
gnfqa6	liberal	Facebook is letting the Trump campaign publish at least 529 false ads accusing the left of voter fraud	"As government officials consider implementing vote-by-mail for the 2020 election because of the coronavirus pandemic, President Donald Trump is using Facebook and Instagram ads to ramp up false allegations of voter fraud. These allegations compound years of lies from Trump and his allies in right-wing media repeating false claims of widespread voter fraud.

Facebook’s ad policy formerly banned “misleading or false” information, but the platform narrowed its policy in October 2019, prohibiting only those “ads that include claims debunked by third-party fact checkers” and even exempting ads from politicians from this fact-checking. This policy has faced a lot of criticism, but Facebook has only doubled down as it continues to let Trump run misleading ads against his critics and opponents.

Some of the Trump campaign’s latest ads, which started running on both Facebook and Instagram on May 18, falsely claim that the “Radical Left is trying to STEAL THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION OF OUR LIVES.” Using the Dewey Square Adwatch toolset to analyze Facebook Ad data, Media Matters found at least 529 of these ads, and 267 of them -- more than half -- make various other false accusations against Democrats, including that they are “stuffing the ballot boxes with FAKE and FRAUDULENT votes.” These ads were all paid for by Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., and they are being advertised by Donald J. Trump, Mike Pence, and Team Trump’s Facebook pages. The ads, which have been running on Facebook for less than two full days, have the potential to reach millions of people through the social media platform. (At time of publication, 525 of the ads are currently active, out of which at least 15 ads are appearing as blank in the Facebook Ad Library.)"	left
lzd9ge	liberal	America's oldest college debate society votes to strip Ted Cruz of a prestigious Princeton honor for public service	"Princeton's American Whig-Cliosphic Society voted to strip Sen. Ted Cruz of a public service award.

Society members voted 37-32 in favor of rescinding the honor, The Daily Princetonian reported.

Cruz is facing criticism for his role in the insurrection on January 6 and an ill-timed Cancun trip.

Visit the Business section of Insider for more stories.

America's oldest collegiate debate society has voted to strip Sen. Ted Cruz of its highest honor, according to The Daily Princetonian.

Princeton University's American Whig-Cliosphic Society passed a motion to rescind the James Madison Award for Distinguish Public Service awarded to Cruz in 2016, the newspaper reported.

Members of the society proposed the motion because unhappy at Cruz's support of baseless voter fraud claims in the 2020 election and the January 6 Capitol attack.

The award — introduced in 1960 — is bestowed upon individuals who have ""taken up the arduous but righteous cause of dedicating their life to the betterment of society,"" according to the society's website.

This is the first time in the society's history that members have voted to rescind this award, The Daily Princetonian said.

After a 90-minute debate, 37 people voted in favor of rescinding, 32 voted not to rescind, and five people abstained, the newspaper reported.

Cruz graduated from Princeton in 1992 and was considered a brilliant orator in his youth.

The society's Board will now make a decision of Trustees as to whether the award should formally be revoked, according to The Daily Princetonian.

Cruz's approval rating has tanked in recent weeks. An ill-timed trip to Cancun while his home state of Texas experienced a catastrophic winter storm cost him in the polls.

His approval rating dropped from +6 to -5 between February 18 and-28, according to a Morning Consult poll of over 2,000 registered voters.

Cruz's reputation is also tarnished by his refusal to accept the 2020 presidential election result.

The senator spearheaded the Senate GOP effort to object to the certification of President Joe Biden's victory. Several lawmakers called for Cruz to resign after a pro-Trump mob violently stormed the Capitol minutes after he gave a speech on the Senate floor."	left

McEnany and her two deputies, Chad Gilmartin and Karoline Leavitt, are among at least 18 people people in the White House, or connected to Trump's reelection campaign or to recent White House events, who have tested positive for Covid-19 since late last week. ""After testing negative consistently, including every day since Thursday, I tested positive for COVID-19 on Monday morning while experiencing no symptoms,"" McEnany said on Twitter. ""No reporters, producers, or members of the press are listed as close contacts by the White House Medical Unit."" It was not clear when Gilmartin, who is principal assistant press secretary, and Leavitt, who is assistant press secretary, tested positives for Covid-19. Their diagnoses, which were confirmed by NBC News with two sources familiar with their situation, were made public only after McEnany disclosed her diagnois on Twitter. The other people connected to Trump and recent White House events who have tested positive since Thursday include Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, three Republican senators, Mike Lee of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, and Wisconsin's Ron Johnson, as well as Nick Luna, the president's personal assistant. University of Notre Dame President John Jenkins also tested positive, after attending a White House event announcing Trump's nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. In addition, at least three journalists who were at the White House over the past week have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the White House Correspondents Association.

hw34ez	liberal	Biden, Obama reunite for socially distanced conversation, slam Trump’s handling of COVID-19 crisis	"Showcasing the online campaigning tactics that are likely to dominate the final months of the 2020 presidential race, former Vice President Joe Biden and his old boss, former President Barack Obama teamed up for a socially distant conversation to discuss the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the steps they believe need to be taken to right the American economy and the nationwide push for racial justice in the wake of the death of George Floyd.

The in-person discussion, filmed last week at the Obama Foundation’s office in Washington, D.C. features both Obama and Biden clad in black face masks as they arrive for the conversation, as the two discuss their incredulity at President Donald Trump's handling of coronavirus.

""Can you imagine standing up when you were president and saying, ‘It's not my responsibility. I take no responsibility.' Literally. Literally,"" Biden said.

""Those words didn't come out of our mouths when we were in office,"" Obama said as the shot of him exiting his car is seen.

""No. I don't understand his inability to get a sense of what people are going through,"" Biden said. ""He can't relate in any way.""

Without mentioning him by name, President Obama took aim at his successor’s handling of the current coronavirus pandemic while expressing his optimism that his former vice president could help the country recover if elected.

“I have confidence that you're going to actually listen to the experts. And you're going to pay attention to the science, and you're not going to quit on trying to actually bend down the curve of disease and transmission rates,” Obama told Biden.

The pair also discussed their administration’s signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), lamenting the president’s attempts to do away with the law during the coronavirus pandemic, and defending their work as a starting point for health care coverage in the United States.

“It's like a starter house. It's the first house you get and it's not the end of the process it's the beginning of the process,” Obama said of the ACA.

“Remember what I used to say? It's like Social Security when it's first passed,” Biden added, noting the expansion of the program over time.

The images are the first of the two men appearing together in person during the 2020 campaign, and come months after Obama formally endorsed Biden in April.

The two men also discussed the current protests and push for racial equality and the Black Lives Matter movement, which both men agreed is largely fueled by a younger generation no longer willing to accept the status quo.

“What we have seen is this extraordinary mobilization across the country of people of every walk of life, every race, every creed who say we're past time to do something about this we understand we're not going to fix it all in one day. But we're going to take this seriously and we're going to start now,” Obama said, noting that both his daughters and Biden’s granddaughters have participated in the recent push for change.

“Policy is important, laws are important, budgets are important, but you know what's important also is what kind of values are you communicating?” Obama added, expressing his confidence that Biden’s agenda will address all of the root causes of systemic racism, not just those reflected in the way America polices its citizens.

Biden, as he has throughout the entirety of his presidential bid, decried President Trump as a leader disinterested in addressing racial inequality, and who instead chooses to divide Americans to benefit his political standing.

“This guy has generated a sense out there that people are waking up to it. He ran by deliberately dividing people from the moment he came down that escalator. And I think people are now going, ‘I don't want my kid growing up that way,’” Biden said of his Republican rival.

Obama consistently praised Biden as an “effective” vice president that is able to relate to the struggles facing American families.

“If you can sit down with a family, and see your own family and the struggles that you've gone through, parents went through or your kids are going through. If you can connect those struggles to somebody else's struggles, then you're going to work hard for it. And that's always what's motivated you to get into public service,” Obama told Biden.

The former president pledged to support Biden’s candidacy and added that he looks forward to helping out the man he worked so closely with for eight years.

“I'm looking forward to working with you to do whatever I can to help. And I have confidence in your commitment to making sure that we seize this moment that we have right now,” Obama told Biden.

“Thank you, and I have faith in the American people,” Biden responded.

The Biden campaign also used the video as a chance to beef up voter files, asking those interested in the video to text the campaign to be notified when the video goes live.

On Twitter alone, the two reached nearly 128 million followers when sharing the conversation, with nearly 121 million of those belonging to Obama. According to the Biden’s campaign’s Digital Director Rob Flaherty, a video previewing the conversation received more than 10 million views across social media platforms Wednesday.

While Obama remained on the sidelines during the Democratic primary race, he has reemerged to offer his support to the man who served alongside him for eight years. Most recently, the two paired up for a grassroots fundraiser in late June that featured a lengthy and wide-ranging conversation.

The event was also Biden’s most successful money event to date, raising more than $11 million.

The new video featuring their chat also comes as Obama is set to participate in his second fundraiser on behalf of the Biden campaign next week.

According to an invitation to the event, obtained by ABC News, Obama will participate in a “virtual conversation” next Tuesday to raise money for Biden’s campaign, which has begun to steadily close the money gap with Trump’s reelection juggernaut.

An aide to the former president said that while the bulk of Obama’s campaigning, both on the presidential level and down the ballot, is expected to happen after Labor Day, the video with Biden was a way to take advantage of the chemistry between the two men in a way that still modeled best behaviors to stop the spread of COVID-19, which continues to rage in many state across the country.

“[The] video is an example of our effort to bring together two beloved and respected leaders to discuss the pressing issues of our time and how Joe Biden will tackle them. We wanted to find a way to tap into the chemistry between the two principals but consistent with all social distancing protocols in order to model best practices,” Eric Schultz, a senior advisor to President Obama, told ABC News.

As Biden continues to roll out his economic agenda, he has kept the coronavirus, and what he argues is the president’s management of the crisis, at the heart of his argument for why Trump does not deserve a second term.

In a speech in New Castle, Delaware, on Tuesday, Biden assailed Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, casting him as a leader indifferent to the ongoing struggles the virus presents to the public health and American economy.

“For all [Trump’s] bluster about his expertise on the economy, he's unable to explain how he'll actually help the working families hit the hardest,” Biden said. “He's quit on you and he’s quit on this country.”

ijnwue	liberal	Biden: Ending Election Security Briefings Is 'Shameless Partisan Manipulation'	"Former Vice President Joe Biden slammed the national intelligence director’s office on Saturday for its abrupt decision to halt in-person congressional election security briefings amid reports concluding that Russia is trying to interfere in the 2020 presidential race.

The Democratic presidential nominee said in a statement that the move by the national intelligence director, John Ratcliffe, “is nothing less than a shameless partisan manipulation” to protect President Donald Trump’s personal interests and is “how American national security and sovereignty are violated.”

“The tools of our government are meant to defend the American people and our system of governance against all enemies, foreign and domestic,” Biden said. “And yet, at a moment when we know that our elections are under threat from foreign interference ― and when the President of the United States has invited interference from Russia and China ― the director of national intelligence is failing to provide full information about the danger.”

Ratcliffe told Congress earlier Saturday that his office will no longer give in-person election security briefings on Capitol Hill, raising concern among lawmakers about the public’s right to know about any foreign interference in the upcoming presidential election. Trump said that Ratcliffe made the decision because the administration “got tired” of election security intelligence reportedly leaking from Congress."	left
l5fwwu	liberal	Kellyanne Conway Accused of Posting Topless Photo of Her 16-Year-Old Daughter on Twitter	"Kellyanne Conway, ex-counselor to former President Trump, allegedly posted a topless picture of her daughter Claudia, 16, on on Monday.

Reached for comment, a Twitter rep told Variety the company’s teams are investigating the incident. “Through technology and human review, we’ll proactively remove any images that violate the Twitter Rules,” the spokesperson added. Kellyanne Conway could not be reached for comment.

According to screen captures posted by users on social media, Kellyanne Conway’s account (@KellyannePolls) shared an image of her topless teenage daughter using Twitter’s recently launched Fleets feature, which deletes posts after a 24-hour period (similar to Instagram and Snapchat’s stories). The Fleet was removed but not before Twitter users documented it.

On TikTok, Claudia Conway on Monday posted videos confirming that the picture was authentic; those have since been deleted from her TikTok account but Twitter users reposted copies of the videos. In the videos, a visibly upset Claudia Conway speculated that her mother may have accidentally posted the image. “I’m assuming my mom took a picture of it to use against me one day and then somebody hacked her or something,” she said. “I’m literally at a loss for words. If you see it, report it.”

In one of the TikTok videos, Claudia Conway said that “nobody would ever have any photo like that, ever. So, Kellyanne, you’re going to fucking jail.”

Last week, Claudia posted a series of TikTok videos accusing her mother of physical and verbal abuse, according to reposts of the clips on Twitter.

In August 2020, Kellyanne Conway announced that she was exiting her White House post to focus on her family after Claudia claimed she was seeking emancipation from her parents over alleged “trauma and abuse.”

In 2019, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel cited Kellyanne Conway for repeated violations of the Hatch Act, an ethics law prohibiting government officials from using their official capacity to advocate for or against political candidates. The OSC’s report, which recommended that Trump fire Conway, found that she had on numerous occasions “disparag[ed] Democratic presidential candidates while speaking in her official capacity during television interviews and on social media.”

UPDATE, 11:15 a.m. ET: In several TikTok videos posted Tuesday morning, Claudia Conway urged people to “stop calling authorities.” She said that she and her mother will be “taking a break from social media” and will work on their relationship. Claudia emphasized that making threats against her family also puts her in danger. “I know that my mom would never, ever post anything to hurt me like that intentionally, and I do believe she was hacked,” Claudia Conway said in one of the TikTok videos Tuesday. Her father, conservative lawyer George Conway, also tweeted a link to one of the TikTok clips she posted, writing, “Our daughter Claudia asked me to tweet this statement for her.”"	left
kdrvrz	liberal	Trump Announces Bill Barr Is on His Way Out Just Minutes After Joe Biden Crossed Electoral College Threshold	"Attorney General Bill Barr has resigned, President Donald Trump tweeted mere minutes after the Electoral College certified that Joe Biden will be sworn in as the 46th President of the United States.

…Deputy Attorney General Jeff Rosen, an outstanding person, will become Acting Attorney General. Highly respected Richard Donoghue will be taking over the duties of Deputy Attorney General. Thank you to all! pic.twitter.com/V5sqOJT9PM — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 14, 2020

“Just had a very nice meeting with Attorney General Bill Barr at the White House. Our relationship has been a very good one, he has done an outstanding job! As per letter, Bill will be leaving just before Christmas to spend the holidays with his family,” President Trump said. “Deputy Attorney General Jeff Rosen, an outstanding person, will become Acting Attorney General. Highly respected Richard Donoghue will be taking over the duties of Deputy Attorney General. Thank you to all!”

The letter from Barr, filled with praise for the president, began by saying he and Trump discussed the Department of Justice’s “review of voter fraud allegations in the 2020 election and how these allegations will continue to be pursued.”

Barr also discussed the origins of his ascent from private life to Attorney General: Robert Mueller’s investigation.

“Your 2016 victory speech in which you reached out to your opponents and called for working together for the benefit of the American people was immediately met by a partisan onslaught against you in which no tactic, no matter how abusive and deceitful, was out of bounds,” Barr said. ” The nadir of this campaign was the effort to cripple, if not oust, your Administration with frenzied and baseless accusations of collusion with Russia.”

Barr said few could be said to be a strong as Trump in the weathering of such attacks. Barr was, of course, instrumental in such resilience. Barr was invited to meet with DOJ officials the very day he sent an “unsolicited” memo on June 8, 2018 criticizing Mueller’s obstruction probe. By Feb. 2019, Barr had assumed the office of Attorney General of the United States for a second time.

From here, the 77th and 85th Attorney General embarked on a journey that Barr’s harshest critics say showed him to be a “bag man” or a “lap dog” for the president: the rolling out of the Mueller Report; making “lunatic authoritarian” Federalist Society speeches; comparing prosecutors to preschoolers; politicizing the DOJ and offering special treatment to the president’s friends; spawning the John Durham investigation; telling falsehoods about voter fraud and catering to the president’s narrative in that arena; coming to the president’s aid in the E. Jean Carroll case and calling that “routine“; the clearing out of protesters from Lafayette Square before the president’s photo op with a Bible; the DOJ’s quick and quiet reaching of a conclusion about President Trump’s Ukraine call; shake-ups at key U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, including the botched firing of former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey Berman; floating sedition charges for American citizens; anarchist jurisdictions; investigations of Democrats, including Andrew Cuomo, for COVID-19 nursing home deaths; Jeffrey Epstein’s death while in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons; and more.

For the above, Barr faced seemingly endless calls for his resignation or impeachment. There were times when Barr said Trump’s tweets were making it “impossible” for him to do his job, and times when Barr said not even Trump can change facts.

In more recent days, Barr enraged the president and his supporters by keeping both the appointment of John Durham as special counsel and the investigation of Hunter Biden under wraps until after the 2020 election. The same reaction occurred when Barr said on Dec. 1 that the DOJ has “not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election.”

Over the last couple of weeks, it was reported that Barr was considering leaving office. It was also reported that Trump was considering firing him.

RELATED: Trump Replaces Barr With Anti-Regulatory and Pro-Corporate Crusader Who Has No Experience as a Prosecutor

Jeffrey Rosen will become acting Attorney General when Barr leaves on Dec. 23, meaning that President Trump will have had four acting Attorneys General and two Attorneys General in four years in office. The first acting AG was Sally Yates, whom Trump quickly fired and replaced with acting AG Dana Boente. Jeff Sessions was the next AG. Matthew Whitaker was installed as acting AG after Sessions was shown the door. Then Barr took over.

hnihe7	liberal	Trump Pushed CIA to Give Intelligence to Kremlin, While Taking No Action Against Russia Arming Taliban	"Why would the Russian government think it could get away with paying bounties to the Taliban to kill American soldiers? One answer to that question may be the extraordinary response that Moscow received when the Trump administration learned of a precursor to the bounty operation. From mid-2017 and into 2018, Pentagon officials became increasingly confident in intelligence reports that the Kremlin was arming the Taliban, which posed a significant threat to American and coalition forces on the ground in Afghanistan.

President Trump’s actions in the face of the Russia-Taliban arms program likely signaled weak US resolve in the eyes of Putin and Russian military intelligence.

Three dimensions of Trump’s response are described in detail in this article, based on interviews with several former Trump administration officials who spoke to Just Security on the record.

First, President Trump decided not to confront Putin about supplying arms to the terrorist group. Second, during the very times in which U.S. military officials publicly raised concerns about the program’s threat to U.S. forces, Trump undercut them. He embraced Putin, overtly and repeatedly, including at the historic summit in Helsinki. Third, behind the scenes, Trump directed the CIA to share intelligence information on counterterrorism with the Kremlin despite no discernible reward, former intelligence officials who served in the Trump administration told Just Security.

Most of these officials emphasized, as a caution, the significant qualitative difference between arming the Taliban and paying bounties to kill American service members—a massive escalation. Unlike bounties, the Russian-Taliban arms program could also be potentially explained, or plausibly denied, by Moscow as an effort to assist the Taliban’s fight against the common enemy of ISIS. That said, the arms also reportedly became increasingly sophisticated in what appears to provide the Taliban an edge against NATO and Afghan government forces.

The failure to push back on the weapons program signaled to Putin that he could press further, said Michael Carpenter, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense with responsibility for Russia in the Obama administration. “When Western powers fail to push back, the Kremlin keeps prodding and probing — until it meets resistance, or until the costs for President Putin and his regime exceed the perceived benefits,” Carpenter wrote in Just Security on Friday.

What we now know is that President Trump not only failed to push back against Russia’s arming the terrorist group. That extraordinary act of omission was coupled with the president’s effort to push the CIA to cooperate with Russia by providing U.S. intelligence to the Kremlin on counterterrorism operations despite getting nothing in return, according to former officials.

A. Top Military Officials Sounds the Alarm

President Trump has denied being informed of U.S. intelligence reports on the Russian bounty operation, but the same can’t be so easily claimed about the Russian weapons to the Taliban. Over the course of 2017 and 2018, senior military officials began speaking openly, in media interviews and before Congress, about their increasing confidence in the intelligence picture of the Russian arms and the significant concerns it raised for U.S. and Coalition troops.

The following Timeline shows the series of public statements by senior military officials about the Kremlin’s provision of weapons to the Taliban.

Timeline

Feb. 9, 2017: Gen. John Nicholson, Commander, U.S. Forces Afghanistan and NATO’s Resolute Support Mission, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee made headlines by drawing attention to Russian efforts to support the Taliban; over the following months, senior military officials would specifically identify the problem of Russian provision of weapons to the Taliban Note on President Trump: On Feb. 16, 2017 President Trump says in a press conference , “by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia;” “If we could get along with Russia, that’s a positive thing. We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who is going to be meeting with them shortly. And I told him, I said, I know politically it’s probably not good for me;” “if we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing.” March 23, 2017: Gen. Curtis M. Scaparrotti, Commander, U.S. European Command and Supreme Allied Commander, Europe in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee raises the Russian arms issue March 29, 2017: Gen. Joseph L. Votel, Commander, U.S. Central Command in testimony before the House Armed Services Committee raises the Russian arms issue April 24, 2017: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Gen. John Nicholson, Commander, Resolute Support and U.S. Forces Afghanistan, in a press conference held in Afghanistan raise the Russian arms issue Note on President Trump: On May 10, 2017, Trump meets with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the Oval Office, where the President reportedly passes highly classified information to the two Russian officials Note on President Trump: On May 25, 2017, in Europe, Trump chastises NATO leaders for their “chronic underpayments” to the alliance and fails to reaffirm U.S. commitment to Article 5 of the Atlantic Charter for collective self-defense in a speech; the omission surprises Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and National Security Advisor McMaster, who endeavored to include language supporting Article 5 in Trump’s remarks prior to the summit, Politico reports Note on President Trump: On July 9, 2017: Upon returning from his first face-to-face meeting with Putin at the G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, Trump tweets , “Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia!” Note on President Trump: July 19, 2017: US officials announce that Trump has decided to end a program to arm Syrian rebels. An anonymous current official tells the Washington Post, “This is a momentous decision. … Putin won in Syria.” A former White House official tells the Post, “People began thinking about ending the program, but it was not something you’d do for free.” “To give [the program] away without getting anything in return would be foolish.” These statements are even more relevant in consideration of Russia’s arming of the Taliban at the time. Sept. 28, 2017: Sec. Mattis in a joint press conference with Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg raises the Russian arms issue Note on President Trump: On Jan. 29, 2018: The White House announces it will not impose new sanctions on Russia March 23, 2018: Gen. John Nicholson, Commander, Resolute Support and U.S. Forces Afghanistan in an interview with the BBC raises the Russian arms issue Note on President Trump: On July 5, 2018: President Trump says at a political rally, “I might even end up having a good relationship, but they’re going, ‘Will President Trump be prepared? You know, President Putin is KGB and this and that.’ You know what? Putin’s fine. He’s fine.” Note on President Trump: On July 16, 2018, in a very friendly summit between the two leaders at Helsinki, President Trump publicly sides with President Putin over the U.S. intelligence community on the Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections

On Sept. 1, 2018, Gen. Nicholson told the Voice of America, “We know that Russia is attempting to undercut our military gains and years of military progress in Afghanistan, and make partners question Afghanistan’s stability.” A few days later, he steps down, as scheduled, after serving in the position for over two years. Mattis resigns that December over sharp policy differences with the president.

B. President Trump’s Noticeable Silence

Absent from those public statements by top military officials were similar public statements or public protestations by President Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, or Mattis’s successors. “Nicholson’s 2018 interview was a rare public protest by a U.S. official. Trump didn’t press the Russians to stop, and so they continued,” wrote the Washington Post’s David Ignatius last week.

Peter Bergen observed a similar discrepancy between Nicholson’s BBC interview and President Trump’s disposition toward Putin, in Bergen’s 2019 book, Trump and His Generals: The Cost of Chaos.

If anything, there was reason for administration officials to intensify their public opposition to Russian military support for the Taliban, not quiet themselves. That’s in part because the Kremlin’s support became more sophisticated and a greater threat to U.S., NATO, and Afghan forces, Carpenter told me. In an email, he said:

The type of equipment the Russians transferred to the Taliban also shows how the Kremlin was becoming increasingly confrontational over time. At first, the Russians were mostly providing excess AK-47s, weapons that are found in almost every major global conflict. More recently, however, they also started transferring night-vision equipment, which is both in shorter supply in Russia but also specifically intended to equalize the gap between NATO forces and the Taliban. Throughout the conflict in Afghanistan, U.S. special forces have always “owned the night.” The Russians wanted to change that to the detriment of the U.S. and its NATO allies.

At a press conference this past Wednesday, July 1, Pompeo suggested that he repeatedly confronted his Russian counterparts about the arms program, even though the reporter had not asked about that program. The reporter posed a question about the bounties:

On this bounty issue, you had some conversations with senior Russian officials after your aides were told about evidence of the Russian bounties. Did you use those opportunities to tell Moscow not to endanger U.S. troops in that manner?

In his response, Pompeo raised the arms program:

We took this seriously; we handle it appropriately. The Russians have been selling small arms that have put Americans at risk there for 10 years. We have objected to it. To your point, when I meet with my Russian counterparts, I talk with them about this each time: “Stop this.” … So yes, maybe not every time, but with great frequency, when I speak to my Russian counterparts we talk about Afghanistan. We talk about the fact that we don’t want them engaged in this.

In his reply, Pompeo had made one of the strongest statements to date of the administration’s confidence in the intelligence assessment of the Russian-Taliban arms program and its threat to US forces. (See also Pompeo’s reiterating those claims later the same day in a Fox News interview.)

But Pompeo’s claim to have “handle[d] it appropriately” and to have raised the arms supplies with his Russian counterparts, presumably including Foreign Minister Lavrov, is dubious.

“To my knowledge, this was never raised with Putin by Trump or any other senior officials, nor am I aware of any specific high-level pushes for this to be raised with senior Russian officials,” a former senior Trump administration official told Just Security.

Nonetheless, it can’t be completely ruled out that Pompeo raised the issue, for example, in one-on-one meetings. But how much would that matter without President Trump’s taking action including in his public statements about Russia and engagements with Putin?

In speaking about both the Kremlin’s arms and bounty programs, Brett McGurk, who served as Special Presidential Envoy until December 2018, told me, “Both should have been flagged and raised in Trump’s frequent engagements with Putin. It’s even worse if Pompeo was raising the arming issue with Lavrov (as he claims) or Khalilzad with his counterpart, but Trump never raised the issue with Putin. That makes whatever Pompeo may have said irrelevant, as the Russians dismiss anything Americans officials say if not backed from the top.”

I asked Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, a former senior CIA official with expertise on Russia and counterterrorism, how the President’s inaction in this policy space would affect any similar efforts on the part of senior intelligence officials to raise concerns with their Russian counterparts. “Given Trump’s permissive relationship with Putin, and his generally skeptical attitude concerning US intelligence, Russian special services would feel more inclined to ignore any US demands for action if they doubted the president’s resolve to back up the US intelligence community,” Mowatt-Larssen told me.

C. Trump Pushes CIA to Share Intelligence with Russia

At the same time that senior US military officials were publicly expressing concerns that Russia was arming the Taliban’s terrorist activities that threatened U.S. personnel, President Trump was pushing the CIA to share counterterrorism intelligence information with the Kremlin.

In the first weeks of the administration, National Security Advisor Michael Flynn tried to push the Defense Department to engage in cooperation with Russia, but the Pentagon and Centcom opposed his efforts, the Daily Beast’s Spencer Ackerman reported. Flynn was not the first to consider such an idea. Secretary of State John Kerry floated the concept of cooperation with Russia against terrorist groups in Syria during the final year of the Obama administration, but was rebuffed by Defense Secretary Ash Carter and other parts of the administration. Like Kerry, Flynn ran into a roadblock: a provision of the National Defense Authorization Act strictly prohibits “bilateral military-to-military cooperation” between the United States and Russia, unless the Secretary of Defense issues a waiver and notifies Congress. Mattis reportedly refused to issue a waiver.

[For more on that statute, see former Department of Defense Acting General Counsel Robert S. Taylor’s analysis and my earlier coverage at Just Security in 2018.]

But there’s no analogous statute barring cooperation by the CIA.

That’s where the White House succeeded in pushing the CIA to cooperate with Russia despite analysts determining the Kremlin would provide nothing in return, two former CIA officials who served in the Trump administration told me.

“There was a consistent push for CT cooperation with Moscow, coming from the White House, despite near universal belief within the IC that this effort would be one sided and end up being a waste of time and energy,” said Marc Polymeropoulos, who retired in mid-2019 from the Senior Intelligence Service at the CIA.

“To be fair, every administration wants a reset with Moscow, and thus the IC dutifully attempted to engage with the Russian government on CT matters,” he added in discussing the Trump policy. “Bottom line, we tried, as this was the guidance from policy makers. There was no ‘deep state push back,’ there was no stalling, there was a concerted effort to work with the Russians.”

Douglas London, a CIA Senior Operations Officer who retired at the end of 2018, told me that “despite increasing reflections of Russian material support to the Taliban raised publicly by Defense Secretary James Mattis in 2017 and throughout 2018 by General John Nicholson, President Trump pressured CIA to invest time and resources increasing counterterrorist cooperation with Russia.”

Prior administrations had also considered counterterrorism cooperation with Russia but learned the lesson that it was a one-way street on “cooperation.” In testimony before the Congressional Helsinki Commission, Carpenter gave the example of attempted cooperation around the Sochi Olympics. “We discovered that our chief interlocutor was not a counterterrorism expert but rather a counter-intelligence official, bluntly demonstrating Moscow’s chief priority lay in collecting intelligence on foreigners rather than sharing information on terrorist threats,” the former deputy assistant secretary of defense said.

Polymeropoulos who was personally involved in making a trip to Moscow in late 2017 to advance the cooperation policy told me of a similar conclusion to the effort. “As we anticipated, however, it was a sisyphean task. We ended up only giving information, and not receiving anything worthwhile. I cannot think of anything of value that the Russians provided us, that saved any US lives, or was worth even the time it took to pick up the phone to set up the meetings.”

“It was always the same line from downtown, even when failure was so evident and so obvious–keep engaging on CT.” Polymeropoulos said. “This myth that Russians could be a good CT partner—that former National Security Advisor Flynn first perpetuated and then became the cornerstone of this farcical engagement strategy–was by 2019 met with near total derision and eye rolling in the IC.”

“The direction [from President Trump] came despite assessments that Russia was not being forthcoming,” London said. “Failing to reciprocate U.S. willingness and share information on what ostensibly represented threats from common adversaries such as al-Qa’ida and ISIS, Russian counterparts used counterterrorism engagements to further counterintelligence.”

Before entering the administration, Pompeo himself had expressed contempt for the idea of cooperating with the Russians on counterterrorism. Asked to comment on Secretary Kerry’s proposal in October 2016, then-Congressman Pompeo was nothing short of scathing, “For the United States to share intelligence in a way that they hope we can keep sources and methods secure is foolish. … a dumb idea … such an awful idea … I hope that the silliness of Secretary Kerry on this issue will never come to fruition. It would be bad … for America.”

Pompeo served as CIA Director during the program described by Polymeropoulos and London. He left the CIA for the State Department in late April 2018.

D. Protections of US Personnel on the Ground: Getting Priorities Straight

The heart of the criticism of President Trump’s handling of Russian bounty intelligence reports has been his lack of action toward Moscow to safeguard American troops threatened by Russia’s aggression. Trump’s lack of response to the Russian arms to the Taliban may have helped pave the way to the increasingly audacious acts by Putin against U.S. forces. Was it a case of the President Trump making tradeoffs in his relationship with Putin?

“The operators on the ground are always victims of this strategic chess game,” Polymeropoulos said.

Polymeropoulos advised putting it in the context of Pakistan’s support for the Taliban and the failure of administrations’ to push back adequately with Islamabad. “Pakistan is far more complicit, Russians did it but not to the level of the Pakistanis, until the bounty issue. The bounty issue takes this to another level perhaps putting Russia now in the category of Pakistan, as a state sponsor of terrorism, in my view.”

Bipartisan legislation in the Senate, co-sponsored by Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO) and Sen. Robert Menendez, (D-NJ) and passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in December, would place pressure on the State Department to designate Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. Politico reported, in the wake of revelations about Russia’s bounty operation, that Gardner has renewed his push for the legislation with Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) voicing support in recent days.

I also communicated with Ambassador Todd Buchwald who retired from the State Department in July 2017, after serving across five Republican and Democratic administrations. As the Special Coordinator for the Department’s Office of Global Criminal Justice since 2015, one of Buchwald’s areas of expertise is the International Criminal Court’s investigation of US forces in Afghanistan.

Buchwald compared President Trump’s response to the Russian arms and bounty programs to the administration’s most recent actions toward the ICC. He provided a comment by email:

This episode just underscores how hard it is to figure out how the Administration decides what are and what are not our urgent national priorities – the situations in which it is appropriate for the President to invoke the extraordinary authorities that Congress long ago entrusted to Presidents upon a “declaration of national emergency.” Look at the administration’s reactions to two threats: the potential for an ICC case alleging U.S. detainee abuse in Afghanistan, and Russian support for the actual slaughter of U.S. service members there. Just three weeks ago, the President asserted his “steadfast commitment to protecting American service members and defending our national sovereignty” as his basis for his Executive Order imposing sanctions against the International Criminal Court. There are lots of different views about the Court but in fact it has never — in its history – actually convicted, or even prosecuted, the acts of a service member of the standing military of any state, much less a state as strong — and as committed to the rule of law — as the United States. Meanwhile, the Russians have — since the early days of the Administration (see here and here) — been smuggling secret weapons to our battlefield adversaries, intent on conducting actual deadly attacks on those service members; and then, following the President’s lack of objection, appear to have breathtakingly upped the ante by offering bounties for killing American troops. It is fair to ask: which of the two – the ICC or the Russians – actually imperils our troops in Afghanistan?; and which — in the words of the President’s Executive Order — actually constitutes “an unusual and extraordinary threat” to U.S. national security?

On Thursday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee will hold a hearing titled, “Russian Bounties on U.S. Troops: Why Hasn’t the Administration Responded?” The witnesses include Gen. Nicholson and former Acting CIA Director Mike Morrell.

kivo7h	liberal	"Pelosi on Trump's call to increase stimulus payments: ""Let's do it!"""	"House Democrats responded to President Trump's call to increase stimulus payments to $2,000 per adult by saying they're ready to bring the measure to the floor by ""unanimous consent"" this week.

Driving the news: Trump indicated in a video Tuesday evening that he won't sign the $900 billion coronavirus relief bill and $1.4 trillion government funding measure passed by Congress if it's not amended to increase stimulus payments.

Trump's Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who was involved in negotiating the bill, said Monday that the $600 checks passed by Congress would go out next week.

But Trump said he's asking Congress to send him an amended bill, calling on lawmakers to ""increase the ridiculously low"" amount Americans would receive for COVID relief to $2,000 per adult or $4,000 for a couple, and ""get rid of wasteful and unnecessary items"" in the spending bill.

What they're saying: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), tweeted, ""Republicans repeatedly refused to say what amount the President wanted for direct checks. At last, the President has agreed to $2,000 — Democrats are ready to bring this to the Floor this week by unanimous consent. Let’s do it!.""

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said in a Twitter post, ""House Democrats have fought for months to provide relief to the American people, which Republicans rejected at every turn. Now that the President has agreed to direct payments of $2000, we will ask for unanimous consent to pass a bill this week to give Americans this assistance.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) urged Trump to sign the current bill ""to help people and keep the government open.""

""We're glad to pass more aid Americans need,"" Schumer tweeted. ""Maybe Trump can finally make himself useful and get Republicans not to block it again.""

The big picture: Trump's surprise announcement on Tuesday could delay desperately needed aid for millions of Americans if the president decides not to sign the package as it stands. It also risks a government shutdown on Dec. 28.

msfd7x	liberal	Justice Department sues Trump ally Roger Stone, alleging millions in unpaid taxes	"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department on Friday sued Roger Stone, a longtime ally of former President Donald Trump, accusing Stone and his wife, Nydia, of owing nearly $2 million in unpaid federal income taxes and fees.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, says the couple underpaid their income taxes by $1,590,361 from 2007 to 2011. It further says Stone, 68, did not pay his full tax bill in 2018, coming up $407,036 short. The couple, the suit alleges, used a commercial entity to ""shield their personal income from enforced collection and fund a lavish lifestyle despite owing nearly $2 million in unpaid taxes, interest and penalties.""

Stone, a well-known Republican political operative and a friend of the former president, briefly served as a campaign adviser to Trump.

""This is yet another example of the Democrats weaponizing the Justice Department in violation of the rule of law,"" Stone said in a statement Friday night. ""I will fight these politically motivated charges and I will prevail again.""

Stone was on his way to federal prison in July 2020 when then-president Trump commuted his sentence. Stone was sentenced earlier that year to serve 40 months in prison for lying to Congress about his efforts to connect with WikiLeaks in hopes of digging up dirt on Trump's 2016 rival, Hillary Clinton. The lead prosecutor in the case said Stone had lied because the ""truth looked bad for Donald Trump."" Stone was convicted of all seven counts against him.

Stone said Friday, ""This case against me is motivated by blood lust and liberal hysteria over the fact that President Trump saw the clear corruption of my trial and had the strength and the courage to correct this injustice by issuing me a grant of clemency.""

The Stones deposited more than $1 million in accounts belonging to a commercial entity, Drake Ventures, instead of personal accounts, thereby frustrating collection efforts, the government said in the filing.

From those accounts, the pair covered a down payment on a Fort Lauderdale condominium, paid for personal expenses and covered some of their tax liabilities, the lawsuit alleges, calling the entity an ""alter ego"" of the Stones.

Additionally, the filing wants to thwart the Stones' transfer of their $525,000 Florida condominium to an entity known as the Bertran Family Revocable Trust, which the government says is controlled by Nydia Stone and has as beneficiaries their children, Adria Stone and Scott Stone.

A tax lien was being sought against the property, it said. The suit also seeks a judgment for $1,590,361.89.

The government also said the Stones at one point entered into an agreement to cover taxes owed through monthly installments of nearly $20,000, but stopped paying. Additionally, the filing alleges that in 2018, Stone filed his federal income tax return as ""a married individual filing separately from his spouse"" and owes an additional $407,036.84 for that year alone.

It was after his indictment in 2019 that Stone and his wife created the Bertran fund and purchased the condo, the federal filing said.

""The Stones intended to defraud the United States by maintaining their assets in Drake Ventures’ accounts, which they completely controlled, and using these assets to purchase the Stone Residence in the name of the Bertran Trust,"" it alleged.

""The Stones were in substantial debt to the United States at the time of the transfer, rendering them insolvent at the time of the transfer and unable to pay their debt to the United States,"" the filing said.

Trump pardoned Stone in December along with a number of other close allies."	left
ih28ce	liberal	RNC Speaker Cancelled After Boosting QAnon Conspiracy Theory About Jewish Plot to Enslave the World Will Sommer	"One of the speakers for the second night of the Republican National Convention was pulled from the program after The Daily Beast surfaced a tweet from her, earlier in the day, urging her followers to investigate a supposed Jewish plot to enslave the world.

“Do yourself a favor and read this thread,” Mary Ann Mendoza, who is a member of the Trump campaign’s advisory board, tweeted to her more than 40,000 followers Tuesday morning.

Mendoza, an “angel mom,” was scheduled to speak Tuesday about her son’s 2014 death at the hands of a drunk driver who was in the country illegally. But a Republican source familiar with the programming said the speech had been cancelled amid uproar over her tweet.

Hours earlier, Mendoza had linked to a lengthy thread from a QAnon conspiracy theorist that laid out a fevered, anti-Semitic view of the world. In its telling, the Rothschilds—a famous Jewish banking family from Germany—created a plot to terrorize non-Jewish “goyim,” with purported details of their scheme that included plans to “make the goyim destroy each other” and “rob the goyim of their landed properties.”

Drawing on more than a century’s worth of anti-Semitic hoaxes and smears, the thread claimed that malevolent Jewish forces in the banking industry are out to enslave non-Jews and promote world wars. Riddled with QAnon references, the thread from Twitter user @WarNuse claimed that the Titanic had been sunk to protect the Federal Reserve, and that every president between John F. Kennedy and Donald Trump was a “slave president” in the thrall of a global cabal.

The thread also promoted “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,” an anti-Semitic hoax popular in Nazi Germany, and claimed that its allegations about a Jewish plot to control the world are real.

“The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is not a fabrication,” the thread that Mendoza shared reads. “And, it certainly is not anti-semetic (sic) to point out this fact.”

After The Daily Beast published this article, Mendoza deleted her tweet and tweeted an apology “for not paying attention to the intent of the whole message.” While Mendoza had initially urged her followers to read the thread, she claimed on Tuesday evening that she had not read all of the posts in the thread.

“That does not reflect my feelings or personal thoughts whatsoever,” Mendoza tweeted.

Though her speech was cancelled, the Mendoza episode is just the latest example of a convention speaker with a checkered background. As the Republican festivities enter their second night, several scheduled speakers have already been exposed for holding bizarre beliefs.

Public school teacher Rebecca Friedrichs, who spoke at the convention on Monday, has claimed that public schools use their curricula to “groom” children for sexual predators like Jeffrey Epstein. On Tuesday, Vice reported that anti-abortion activist and convention speaker Abby Johnson praised the idea of police racially profiling her biracial son as “smart.”

“Statistically, my brown son is more likely to commit a violent offense over my white sons,” Johnson said in a video.

Mendoza’s tweet urging her followers to check out the anti-Semitic thread came on the eve of her Republican convention appearance. While the thread includes extensive anti-Semitism and references to QAnon, it also alleges that Hillary Clinton is a “Satanic High Priestess” and that Barack Obama’s Washington home smells like sulfur — a reference to the idea, popular with InfoWars host Alex Jones, that Obama somehow smells like sulfur because he’s connected to the devil and Hell.

The Trump campaign and Mendoza didn’t respond to requests for comment. But Democratic super PAC American Bridge 21st Century slammed Mendoza's one-time inclusion on the RNC schedule as ""unacceptable.""

“Mary Ann Mendoza's initial inclusion speaks volumes about the radicalization of the Republican Party under Donald Trump and where we're headed if he has four more years to spread hate and division from the White House,” Kyle Morse, a spokesman for American Bridge’s “Trump War Room” opposition research group said. “Trump and his campaign refused to speak out against anti-Semitism and only pulled Mendoza because they got caught.”

In addition to the thread she encouraged people to read, Mendoza also has posted her own tweets that push conspiracy theories about Democratic billionaire George Soros. One tweet from June 2019 claimed that Soros was pushing for more immigration to install a “one world government.”

“These are the violent types of people that SOROS, the ROTHCHILDS (sic) and the United Nations have NO problem using as pawns and uprooting them and bringing them to the USA to accomplish their ONE WORLD GOVT!” Mendoza tweeted.

Mendoza has alleged that public health advice advocating for mask-wearing are using the “Soros playbook,” and claimed that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s lead infectious disease expert, is paid by Soros.

In a Sept. 2019 tweet, Mendoza called Soros, a Holocaust survivor, a “Nazi.”

“This Nazi is still at it & the progressives love him for it,” she wrote."	left
gz1jur	liberal	‘They set us up’: US police arrested over 10,000 protesters, many non-violent. Over 10,000 people have been arrested around the US, as police regularly use pepper spray, rubber bullets, teargas and batons.	"Since George Floyd’s death at the hands of police in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 25 May, about 140 cities in all 50 states throughout the US have seen protests and demonstrations in response to the killing.

More than 10,000 people have been arrested around the US during the protests, as police forces regularly use pepper spray, rubber bullets, teargas and batons on protesters, media and bystanders. Several major US cities have enacted curfews in an attempt to stop demonstrations and curb unrest.

Jarah Gibson was arrested while non-violently protesting in Atlanta, Georgia, on 1 June.

“The police were there from the jump and literally escorted us the whole march,” said Gibson.

She said around 7.30pm, ahead of Atlanta’s 9pm city-wide curfew, police began boxing in protesters. While protesters were attempting to leave, Gibson tried to video-record a person on a bicycle who appeared to be hit by a police car and was arrested by police. She was given a citation for “pedestrian in a roadway,” and “refusing to comply when asked to leave”.

“The police are instigating everything and they are criminalizing us. Now I have my mugshot taken, my fingerprints taken and my eyes scanned. Now I’m a criminal over an illegal arrest,” added Gibson. “I want to be heard and I want the police to just abide by basic human decency.”

Ruby Anderson was arrested while non-violently protesting in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 31 May. The police refused to provide a reason for her detention until they were placed in a police van, where they were told the charge was loitering. They were given a wristband that stated “unlawful assembly” and ultimately charged with disorderly conduct.

“While I was arrested, I was standing next to two white people who were doing the same thing as me, standing between a group of officers and a group of black teenagers. I was the only one arrested in my group of three, I was the only black person,” Anderson said.

Reports of excessive police force throughout the protests have emerged around the US. More than 130 reports of journalists being attacked by police have been recorded since 28 May.

On 2 June, six police officers in Atlanta, Georgia, were charged with excessive force during an arrest of two college students on 30 May. A staggering 12,000 complaints against police in Seattle, Washington, were made over the weekend of 30 May in response to excessive force at protests.

A Denver, Colorado, police officer was fired for posting on Instagram “let’s start a riot”. In New York City, videos surfaced of NYPD officers pointing a gun at protesters, driving an SUV into a crowd of protesters, swiping a protester with a car door, an officer flashing a white supremacy symbol, and another officer shoving a woman to the ground, which left her hospitalized.

Several protesters and bystanders around the US have been left hospitalized from rubber bullet wounds, bean bags, teargas canisters and batons, while police have reportedly torn down medical tents and destroyed water bottles meant for protesters.

In Minneapolis, Minnesota, Dan Rojas was arrested on the morning of 27 May. Though there were no protests occurring at the time, Rojas had decided to clean up fragments of rubber bullets, teargas and frag canisters on the public sidewalk in his neighborhood when six police officers confronted him and arrested him.

“They put me in handcuffs, took my property off of me, and they shoved a local reporter out of the way. They put me in a squad car and arrested me for rioting at 10.30 in the morning, the day after a peaceful protest,” said Rojas, who was not released until over 48 hours later. “At the end of it no charges were filed, everything was dropped and I was never told the probable cause they had to arrest me.”

Several non-violent protesters arrested during demonstrations requested to remain anonymous for fear of police retaliation as they still face citations and pending charges. The protesters described police tactics of “kettling”, where protesters were surrounded and blocked by police forces from leaving, often until curfews took effect or arrests were made for obstructing a roadway.

“The curfews are a way to give police more power, exactly the opposite of what protesters want. These curfews, like most other ‘law and order’ tactics, will disproportionately impact the very same communities that are protesting against state-sponsored violence and brutality,” said Dr LaToya Baldwin Clark, assistant professor of law at UCLA.

One protester in Los Angeles, California, told how she was returning to her apartment before the city’s 6pm curfew, while police were blocking protesters and obstructing exits.

“I was arrested two streets away from my apartment, it had just turned 6pm,” said the protester. She noted during the arrests, bystanders were protesting against the arrests from their apartment balconies, while police were aiming rubber bullets, teargas and pepper spray at them.

“They handcuffed us all with zip tie handcuffs and left us in a police bus for about five hours … I asked for medical assistance and they denied it to me, I was handcuffed for over five hours with a bleeding hand that eventually turned purple until I was finally released.”

She was eventually released at 1am on 2 June, with a citation for being out past curfew.

“The police set us up to get arrested. They shut off the streets forcing us on to Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge. Once we were on the bridge, the police blocked both exits in front and behind us,” said a protester in Dallas, Texas, who was arrested on 1 June and later released without charges.

She added: “They shot teargas at us and shot a protester with a rubber bullet and it injured her hand. The police made us all get on the ground, proceeded to zip tie our hands together, lined us up on the side of the highway and left us there for hours.”

In Cincinnati, Ohio, a resident in a neighborhood where protests were occurring on 31 May saw several protesters were at risk of being caught outside past the city’s curfew at 8pm.

“It felt like a trap to me. I felt if I could pick some people up and take them to their cars, I could stop people from getting arrested, so I jumped in my car, drove down the street, saw a group of people hiding, they had their hands up, and they climbed into the car, and shut the doors. We tried to drive, but were stopped,” said the resident. “We were asked to leave the car, zip-tied on the side of the road, loaded on to a bus, and they detained us for a few hours doing paperwork.”

A protester in Houston, Texas, described police kettling her and other protesters before getting arrested on 31 May for obstructing a roadway.

“We weren’t allowed to go home,” she said. “We tried our best to go home and were told ‘no, you’re not leaving.’ From then on, the cops said anyone outside their circle is going to jail and they would push us further from the sidewalk. They had us closed in.”"	left

On Wednesday, a reporter asked President Trump a question no reporter would ever have bothered to ask a president before: “Win, lose, or draw in this election, will you commit here today for a peaceful transferal of power after the election?”

Trump would not commit. “We’re going to have to see what happens,” he said. “We want to get rid of the ballots, and we’ll have a very peaceful — there won’t be a transfer, frankly. There’ll be a continuation.”

Reporter: ""Win, lose or draw in this election, will you commit here today for a peaceful transferal of power after the election?""

That is certainly true — get rid of the ballots, and there won’t be a transfer of power. Most likely, Trump is using “ballots” as shorthand for mail-in ballots, which Democrats — generally more resistant to Trump’s denial of the coronavirus — are employing in far greater numbers. The effect is the same: His plan is to quash the ballots and stay in power.

Like many Trumpian outrages, the president is smashing norms so frequently that each new offense blends into all the others, dulling the system’s capacity for alarm. Earlier this summer, when Chris Wallace asked him if he would accept the result of the election, Trump demurred. “I have to see. Look … I have to see,” he replied, “No, I’m not going to just say yes. I’m not going to say no, and I didn’t last time either.”

Recently he has been citing the need for a ninth Supreme Court justice to resolve a dispute in his favor. “I think it’s better if you go before the election, because I think this scam that the Democrats are pulling — it’s a scam — the scam will be before the United States Supreme Court,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “I think having a 4-4 situation is not a good situation, if you get that. I don’t know that you’d get that. I think it should be 8-0 or 9-0, but just in case it would be more political than it should be, I think it’s very important to have a ninth justice.”

Note that Republicans already have five seats on the Supreme Court. Trump believes the 5-3 conservative majority is not enough to uphold whatever maneuvers he has in mind.

The Atlantic’s Barton Gellman reports on the most concerning possibility: that Trump will first claim victory before mail ballots are tabulated, and then prevail on Republican-controlled state legislatures to appoint their state’s Electoral College votes to Trump, circumventing the votes altogether.

Viewing this scenario as a probability would be hysterical. But the odds are far too high for comfort. The brewing crisis has several components. First, the Republican Party has been evolving toward authoritarianism for decades, driven by a combination of beliefs that demographic change will consign them to minority status forever, and that allowing the majority to redistribute the income of the rich to itself is a dire threat to liberty.

Second, Republican voters and elites have believed for years that urban Democrats routinely engage in mass voter fraud, and refuse to accept any falsification. (The George W. Bush administration ordered prosecutors to bring charges of voter fraud, and fired them when they couldn’t turn up any.)

And third, the rickety constitutional structure is poorly suited to handle a disputed election. One of its massive loopholes allows state legislatures to ignore voters altogether and appoint any electors they want to the Electoral College. Respecting the results of the election is merely optional, a norm. And norms have been falling by the wayside.

Into this mix has dropped a narcissistic, aspirational authoritarian who has no respect for the greater good and has spent years drinking deeply from the conspiratorial well of Fox News. Trump is the driver of the crisis, but he has demonstrated the capacity to bring Republicans along with his most unhinged positions. It is not merely a fear of alienating the voting base that adores his bullying style that disciplines them.

Many Republican elites either admire Trump, or — more commonly — believe he poses less of a threat than Joe Biden’s Democrats. George W. Bush speechwriter Marc Thiessen, an archetypical Republican elite, has a column insisting Biden poses a more serious threat to democracy than Trump, because Biden would support reforms (like D.C. statehood, eliminating the filibuster, supposedly eliminating the Electoral College) that would force Republicans to win a national majority to hold power, which they implicitly consider impossible. Put aside the fact that Biden will likely enact few, if any, of the left’s democratization reforms, or that even a completely democratized system would still have a Republican tilt and give the party plenty of chances to compete.

Biden is currently on the cusp of a victory decisive enough that Trump’s machinations probably cannot stop it. Florida, which is roughly tied, tabulates mail-in ballots quickly, and a Biden win could cut short Trump’s room for mischief.

It should be apparent that all Americans who wish to have a future for democracy have to vote for Biden regardless of their position on any other issue."	left
jjsq5k	liberal	The Son of Former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy Helped Trump Secure Loans at Deutsche Bank	"The son of former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy helped Donald Trump in 2005 secure nearly $700 million in loans to construct a skyscraper in Chicago, despite Trump’s reputation for defaulting on business loans, the New York Times reported on Tuesday evening.

According to the report, Justin Kennedy, who ran the German bank’s commercial real estate team and was close with the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, was willing to overlook Trump’s shoddy history as a debtor, getting the future president to personally guarantee $40 million of the loan. Both Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump currently work in the White House.

The Times reported that Trump was able to convince Kennedy and other top executives that “the Chicago development was a guaranteed moneymaker,” and further signaled “the Trump family’s commitment to the project” by informing the bank that Ivanka would be in charge of the operation.

Justin Kennedy’s role in helping to breathe life into Trump’s business empire before he was president has continued to breed rumors and conspiracies about the alleged “White House charm offensive” carried out by the Trump family to help convince Justice Kennedy to retire and make way for Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment to the bench.

In Dark Towers: Deutsche Bank, Donald Trump and an Epic Trail of Destruction, finance editor of the New York Times David Enrich described how Justin Kennedy was “drawn to Trump’s risk-taking and glamour” while he was shepherding lucrative loans to Trump’s private businesses, even after the bank’s clients took massive losses when Trump’s Atlantic City casinos went bankrupt. After Trump’s election, the family reportedly set their sights on persuading Justice Kennedy to step down so the president could appoint a second justice to the bench.

“Trump’s flattery was part of a coordinated White House charm offensive designed to persuade the ageing justice – for years, the court’s pivotal swing vote – that it was safe to retire, even with an unpredictable man in the Oval Office,” Enrich wrote.

As Law&Crime previously reported, Justin Kennedy was apparently not the only member of the Kennedy family with the White House’s ear.

Washington Post deputy editorial page editor and columnist Ruth Marcus wrote in her 2019 book Supreme Ambition: Brett Kavanaugh and the Conservative Takeover about a suspicious scene in which Kennedy’s other son, Gregory Kennedy, allegedly met with White House counselor Kellyanne Conway during a dinner just days after the president’s inauguration.

No one was happier about the outcome of the election than his father, Gregory Kennedy said, according to the book. Anthony Kennedy had been nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1987, and Marcus wrote that Anthony Kennedy wanted to be replaced on the high court by another Republican.

“That’s good to know,” Conway replied, according to the book. “That happiness has consequences.” In a footnote, Marcus said Gregory Kennedy denied that account.

It was reported earlier this year that, while recording his audiobook, former Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-Ohio) occasionally randomly veered from the script to tell off Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). Specifically, he told Cruz, “Go fuck yourself.”

Now, Axios released the audio. It’s real, and it’s spectacular. Listen:

When @SpeakerBoehner was recording his audiobook I was told by sources that during these wine-soaked sessions he would deviate from the book’s text and insert random violent attacks on @tedcruz. Well, here’s some tape (listen to the end): pic.twitter.com/NFCQ2QFdTT — Jonathan Swan (@jonathanvswan) April 2, 2021

“Freedom,” Boehner says, “means you’re free to reach as high as you want no matter where you came from, even if you’re a little kid sweeping a bar out in southwest Ohio. Take it from me. You’ll never know where you’ll end up. That’s freedom. I’ll raise a glass to that any day. P.S. Ted Cruz, go fuck yourself.”

Boehner isn’t the first Republican politician to make his contempt for the Texas senator known. In 2016, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said, “If you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody would convict you.” Even the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) called Cruz a “wacko bird.”

gc4wmy	liberal	White House blocks Fauci from testifying at House coronavirus hearing	"Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, right, speaks during a Coronavirus Task Force news conference in the briefing room of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, March 21, 2020.

The White House says it blocked key Trump administration health official Dr. Anthony Fauci from testifying at a House hearing on the U.S. coronavirus response next week.

The House Appropriations Committee's subcommittee on the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies wanted Fauci, who has emerged as one of the most trusted voices on the virus, to appear at a Wednesday morning hearing on how the government has handled the pandemic. The panel was ""informed by an administration official that the White House has blocked Dr. Fauci from testifying,"" committee spokesman Evan Hollander said in a statement.

White House spokesman Judd Deere also confirmed the White House stopped the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases from appearing before the House. He said that while the administration tries to combat the pandemic that has now killed more than 60,000 Americans, ""it is counter-productive to have the very individuals involved in those efforts appearing at congressional hearings.""

""We are committed to working with Congress to offer testimony at the appropriate time,"" Deere said in a statement.

But the White House late Friday gave the health official the green light to testify before the Senate Health Committee on May 12, NBC News reported.

A spokesperson for committee Chairman Lamar Alexander said he ""looks forward to hearing from Dr. Fauci and other administration officials.""

The Senate, unlike the House, maintains a GOP majority.

As the White House faces backlash for its early efforts to slow the outbreak's spread and ramp up production of coronavirus tests and medical supplies, it has chafed at most efforts to oversee its actions. On top of regular committee hearings in the House, Democrats also set up a select committee to monitor how the administration implements an unprecedented series of rescue packages that contains more than $2.5 trillion in federal spending."	left
mqxezi	liberal	Biden says parts of US are 'backsliding into the days of Jim Crow'	"(CNN) President Joe Biden said Wednesday that parts of the United States are ""backsliding into the days of Jim Crow"" by passing laws he says are reminiscent of when Black Americans had to pay poll taxes and pass other tests before casting their vote.

""The cry for justice 400 years in the making is ringing out across our nation,"" Biden said as he addressed a virtual conference hosted by the National Action Network, a nonprofit civil rights organization founded by civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton.

The President said: ""Parts of our country are backsliding into the days of Jim Crow, passing laws that harken back to the era of poll taxes -- when Black people were made to guess how many beans, how many jelly beans, in a jar or count the number of bubbles in a bar of soap before they could cast their ballot.""

Last month, Biden called a sweeping Georgia elections bill that imposes new voting restrictions ""Jim Crow in the 21st Century"" and ""an atrocity."" He noted at the time the restrictions disproportionately target Black voters, who were crucial to the recent Democratic victories in Georgia.

Georgia's new law imposes new voter identification requirements for absentee ballots, limits the use of ballot drop boxes, makes it a crime for anyone other than poll workers to approach voters in line to give them food and water and gives state officials more power over local elections.

In trying to use the military to quell nationwide protests, Trump has given the most ominous example yet of his authoritarianism. On Monday night, the world witnessed the disturbing scene of Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, decked out in uniform, accompanying Trump to a photo op at St. John’s Episcopal Church, which had been cleared of protesters by the National Guard and law enforcement agents. Earlier that day, Defense Secretary Mark Esper made a troubling comment describing the American cities experiencing protests as a “battlespace” that the military needed to “dominate.” On Tuesday, there were the unsettling images of the military convoys filling the streets of Washington and a phalanx of uniformed soldiers standing guard outside the Lincoln Memorial.

These are appalling scenes and deserve to be remembered as among the most disgraceful events of Trump’s presidency. But they are also evidence of how feeble Trump’s authority is. Trump confirms the rule that macho bluster is usually a compensation for weakness.

The very decision to make the trip to St. John’s was motivated by a desire to counteract stories that Trump was taking refuge in the White House bunker, which conjured up images of a cowardly president. According to CNN, “Trump himself was angered by coverage depicting him holed up in an underground bunker. He told aides on Monday he wanted to be seen outside the White House gates, according to a person familiar with the matter, which is part of what drove the decision to stage the photo-op at St. John’s Church.”

Trump was surely mindful of the fact that he was being attacked on Fox News for having a weak response to the protests. On Monday Night, Tucker Carlson lambasted him for a supposed failure to protect Americans from protesters. “How are you going to protect the country?” Carlson asked. The Fox News host continued to needle Trump by observing, “The president reassured America that he and his family were just fine. The federally funded bodyguards had kept them safe. He did not mention protecting the rest of the nation, much of which was then on fire. He seemed aware only of himself.” MORE FROM Jeet Heer Philip Roth and His Defensive Fans Are Their Own Worst Enemies April 30, 2021 Free Dr. Seuss! April 7, 2021 The Importance of Logging Off March 22, 2021 Author page

Carlson and other hard-right ideologues have been calling for a harsh crackdown on protesters. Given their prior bigoted rhetoric, it seems like they want to turn the current crisis into a race war.

Trump’s push for a military solution to the uprising seems designed to placate these critics. But he is meeting resistance from the military. Both Esper and Milley are getting pushback from the Pentagon for complying with the president’s wishes on Monday night. In response, the defense secretary and the military leader have been quietly distancing themselves from the St. John’s photo op.

According to NBC News, Esper now denies that he knew he was going to a photo op. The network reports, “Esper said he believed they were going to observe the vandalized bathroom in Lafayette Square, which is near the church.”

The New York Times provides a parallel account: Related Article Military Leaders Have an Extraordinary Choice to Make as the Nation Protests Andrew McCormick

Neither Mr. Esper nor General Milley knew when they went to the Oval Office on Monday that they would be taking part in the president’s photo op, Pentagon officials said. Nor did they know, officials said, that law enforcement personnel would be firing chemical spray and rubber bullets on protesters in Lafayette Square before they crossed that park with Mr. Trump. During the meeting in the Oval Office, which officials said became heated, General Milley and Attorney General William P. Barr argued against invoking the Insurrection Act to override governors and send active-duty troops to states where there are protests. They were able to get Mr. Trump to hold off for now, but the president nonetheless ordered active-duty troops deployed to the one place where he did not have to go through governors: the District of Columbia.

The message of these reports is clear: Esper and Milley are signaling that they didn’t approve of the St. John’s photo op and in fact tried to blunt Trump’s push for using the military all over America and not just in D.C. Nor is the Pentagon alone in wanting to keep Trump at arm’s length. The FBI has leaked information undermining Trump’s preferred narrative of antifa terrorism.

Strikingly, some Republicans are also trying to distance themselves from the St. John’s fiasco. As usual in the Trump era, these criticisms are extremely muted. But they are being made. Maine Senator Susan Collins said, “It was painful to watch peaceful protesters be subjected to tear gas in order for the president to go across the street to a church that I believe he’s attended only once.” She added, “I thought that the president came across as unsympathetic and as insensitive to the rights of people to peaceful protest.”

Oklahoma Senator James Lankford and Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse made similar comments. Also notable was the fact that few Republicans, other than extreme ideologues like Texas Senator Ted Cruz, rose to Trump’s defense. Related Article The FBI Finds ‘No Intel Indicating Antifa Involvement’ in Sunday’s Violence Ken Klippenstein

Trump was bothered enough by these remarks to tweet out a peevish response. “You got it wrong!” Trump tweeted. “If the protesters were so peaceful, why did they light the Church on fire the night before? People liked my walk to this historic place of worship! Sen. Susan Collins, Sen. James Lankford, Sen. Ben Sasse. Please read @MZHemingway below.” Accompanying the tweet was a link to an article by Mollie Hemingway defending Trump’s photo op.

Trump wants to project strength. He told the governors they need to display “dominance” over the protesters. That is the role Trump is trying to perform, of the masterful and overpowering ruler. But such dominance is an aspiration, not a reality.

In truth, Trump is clearly trapped: The hard-right base of the GOP may be goading him to use the military, but the military itself is resisting. Meanwhile, more moderate Republicans are getting skittish. Trump’s coalition is fraying, which is a big problem for his reelection chances. He won in 2016 only through the fluke of his minority of the vote being dominant in the right places by a thin margin. If he wants to win again, he can’t afford for his coalition to shrink even a little bit.

Trump is weak, but he’s still very dangerous. A wounded animal is often fiercer than a healthy one. The weaker Trump is, the more likely it will be that he’ll use what power he has in a reckless manner. The Washington deployment is an attempt to use the military as a political shield. Even if he can’t send troops elsewhere in the United States, there’s still plenty of damage Trump can do with the powers he has as commander in chief."	left
kp0gbq	liberal	Pro-Trump lawyer Lin Wood insists he is not insane after tweeting that Mike Pence should face execution by firing squad	"L. Lin Woods, a pro-Trump attorney, tweeted that Mike Pence could be arrested and executed for treason.

The attorney dismissed claims of ""insanity,"" telling his followers that he is ""fine.""

Some Republicans are angry with Pence for asking a court to throw out a lawsuit against him that sought to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

Wood has previously filed several failed lawsuits attempting to overturn the election's result in Trump's favor.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

L. Lin Wood, a conservative attorney and Trump ally, has rejected questions about his sanity after he tweeted that Vice President Mike Pence should face a firing squad.

The lawyer, who has litigated numerous failed attempts to overturn the result of the 2020 US election, posted a Twitter thread on Friday afternoon.

He wrote about how those who believe the election was stolen have focused on Democrats, the CIA, and ""globalists.""

Wood then said that ""one of the main participants"" had been overlooked — the Republicans.

He then proceeded to call for senior Republicans and a conservative-leaning judge to be arrested.

Wood wrote: ""When arrests for treason begin, put Chief Justice John Roberts, VP Mike Pence, and Mitch McConnell at top of the list.""

Then, in reply to a tweet, Wood suggested that Pence should be executed by firing squad.

He wrote: ""If Pence is arrested, Pompeo will save the election. Pence will be in jail awaiting trial for treason. He will face execution by firing squad. He is a coward and will sing like a bird and confess ALL.""

On social media, many voiced their disbelief at the comments.

Wood, however, dismissed accusations of ""insanity.""

He wrote: ""The tweets about my insanity are at an all-time high this morning. Wonder why?""

The lawyer continued: ""No worries. I am fine. The attacks do not concern me.""

In recent weeks, Pence has been criticized by some Republicans for refusing to declare President Donald Trump the winner of the election when he oversees the ratification of the Electoral College votes on January 6.

A lawsuit was filed by Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas and other Republicans against Pence, claiming that he has the authority to choose which states' electoral votes to count.

The legal bid, however, was dismissed. Pence's lawyers had asked for it to be thrown out.

It was a last-ditch attempt to overturn the results of the election in Trump's favor.

Wood had made several attempts prior to this to undermine Joe Biden's victory.

In November, he filed a federal lawsuit in Georgia which sought to prevent the state from certifying its results.

A month later, Wood joined Sidney Powell in a legal bid to try and overturn Biden's win in Michigan.

In addition to spreading disinformation about the election, Wood has propagated the QAnon conspiracy theory.

Earlier this week, he bizarrely claimed that Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts is a murderous pedophile."	left
mwtbzb	liberal	Trump’s bleach news conference happened one year ago today. We’ve never been the same.	"For weeks, Trump had been giving winding, stream-of-consciousness updates on the state of the Covid fight as it clearly worsened. So when he got up from the Oval Office to brief reporters gathered in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room on April 23, there was no expectation that the day’s proceedings would be any different than usual.

Privately, however, some of his aides were worried. The Covid task force had met earlier that day — as usual, without Trump — to discuss the most recent findings, including the effects of light and humidity on how the virus spreads. Trump was briefed by a small group of aides. But it was clear to some aides that he hadn’t processed all the details before he left to speak to the press.

“A few of us actually tried to stop it in the West Wing hallway,” said one former senior Trump White House official. “I actually argued that President Trump wouldn't have the time to absorb it and understand it. But I lost, and it went how it did.”

Trump started his press conference that day by doing something he’d come to loathe: pushing basic public safety measures. He called for the “voluntary use of face coverings” and said of his administration, “continued diligence is an essential part of our strategy.”

Quickly, however, came a hint at how loose the guardrails were that day. Trump introduced Bill Bryan, head of science and technology at the Department of Homeland Security. “He’s going to be talking about how the virus reacts in sunlight,” the president said. “Wait ‘til you hear the numbers.”

As Bryan spoke, charts were displayed behind him about surface temperatures and virus half-lives. He preached, rather presciently, for people to “move activities outside” and then detailed ongoing studies involving disinfectants. “We tested bleach,” he said at one point. “I can tell you that bleach will kill the virus in five minutes.”

Standing off to the side, Trump clasped his hands in front of his stomach, nodded and looked out into the room of gathered reporters. When Bryan was done, he strode slowly back to the lectern.

“A question that probably some of you are thinking of if you’re totally into that world,” Trump began, clearly thinking the question himself, “So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous — whether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful light — and I think you said that that hasn't been checked, but you're going to test it. And then I said, supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way, and I think you said you're going to test that, too. It sounds interesting. And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning. Because you see it gets in the lungs, and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that.”

Dr. Deborah Birx, Trump’s former coronavirus response coordinator, sat silently off to the side as the president made these suggestions to her. Later, she would tell ABC, “I didn’t know how to handle that episode,” adding, “I still think about it every day.”

Inside the Biden campaign, aides were shocked as well. They were working remotely at that juncture, communicating largely over Signal. But the import of what had happened became quickly evident to them.

“Even for him,” said one former Biden campaign aide, “this was stratospherically insane and dangerous. It cemented the case we had been making about his derelict covid response.”

In short order, the infamous bleach press conference became a literal rallying cry for Trump’s opponents, with Biden supporters dotting their yards with “He Won’t Put Bleach In You” signs. For Trump, it was a scourge. He would go on to insist that he was merely being sarcastic — a claim at odds with the excited curiosity he had posing those questions to Birx. His former team concedes that real damage was done.

“People joked about it inside the White House like, ‘Are you drinking bleach and injecting sunlight?’ People were mocking it and saying, ‘Oh let me go stand out in the sun, and I’ll be safe from Covid,” said one former administration official. “It honestly hurt. It was a credibility issue. … It was hurting us even from an international standpoint, the credibility at the White House.”

That Trump was even at the lectern that day was head-scratching for many. For weeks, he and his team had downplayed the severity of the Covid crisis even as the president privately acknowledged to the Washington Post’s Bob Woodward that it had the potential to be catastrophic. But as it became clearer that the public was not buying the rosy assessments, Trump had decided to take his fate into his own hands — assembling the press on a daily basis to spin his way through the crisis.

He loved it. The former administration official said Trump was elated with the free airtime he was getting on television day after day. “He was asking how much money that was worth,” the aide recalled. The coverage was so ubiquitous that, at one point, Fox News’ Bret Baier attended the briefing and peppered the president with questions because his own show was being routinely interrupted.

The bleach episode changed all that.

Aides immediately understood what a public health quagmire Trump’s remarks had created. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany insisted he was being taken out of context.

“President Trump has repeatedly said that Americans should consult with medical doctors regarding coronavirus treatment, a point that he emphasized again during yesterday’s briefing,” McEnany said in a statement issued the next day. “Leave it to the media to irresponsibly take President Trump out of context and run with negative headlines.”

But behind the scenes, Trump’s remarks were used as evidence by senior aides for why they needed to crack down on unvetted information being put in front of the president. “Either they didn't know what he was going to say — which isn't ideal — or they didn't push back before he went out to the briefing,” said a former senior communications official in the Trump administration. “It was a huge unforced error that could have been prevented.""

By then, White House aides were already debating the efficacy of having Trump relay health information to the public and having to answer whatever question a reporter might throw his way. Some aides — along with Republican allies on Capitol Hill — were pushing to get the president to take a back seat to his health experts at the podium.

“It became like a presser for the sake of having a presser. We didn’t have anything to announce or real policy plans,” a former White House official said. “If you’re just coming out and talking, a Q&A [with reporters] wasn’t going to be helpful.”

Trump would end up doing only a handful more press conferences after the bleach episode before picking them back up again in July. A year later, the episode is still considered a defining point in the Covid fight and a prime exhibit of what can go wrong when an over-confident president believes he can message his way through a once-in-a-lifetime global pandemic.

“Undoubtedly [it was] a seminal moment in presidential communications, and while it is easy to laugh it off, I hope it educates leaders and communicators for decades,” said former Obama White House press secretary Robert Gibbs. “But this was the moment where we knew without any doubt that the government was in way over its head, and its ability to both respond effectively and educate Americans about what to do was not going to be anywhere close to meeting the moment.”"	left
kt0ixg	liberal	A Trump supporter called C-SPAN in tears to ask if her president had lied to her	"For the entire Trump presidency, the question skeptics of the administration kept asking was: what will be enough? What could make his supporters realize they’ve been had?

Charlottesville wasn’t enough; trying to get a foreign prosecutor to pursue his political opponents wasn’t enough; a botched hurricane response that left thousands dead wasn’t enough; a pandemic that left hundreds of thousands dead wasn’t enough. So what would do it?

In that context, something remarkable happened on C-SPAN on Wednesday night, after a Trump-inspired mob stormed the Capitol and attempted to overturn the 2020 presidential election and keep Trump in office. At least one of the group storming the Capitol, Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt, was killed by an unknown shooter after she had made it inside the Capitol building.

On C-SPAN this evening, an apparent Trump supporter, calling herself “Tammy from Boise,” called in and wanted to know: Was her president lying to her?

Here’s a full transcript of “Tammy’s” remarks:

I just have one question. I wanted to know if my president lied to me today. If he did I want him to tell me. More importantly, I want him to tell the family of the woman who got shot and killed today. I voted for him — I voted for him. I’m sorry.

Keep in mind: C-SPAN cannot do live fact-checking of its callers, so there’s absolutely a possibility that “Tammy from Boise” is acting, not really a Trump supporter, etc. We also don’t know if she meant “I’m sorry” to refer to her Trump vote or her emotional state. (We’ll update if we learn more to confirm or disconfirm her call.)

But it’s a powerful moment regardless that encapsulates the degree to which the Trump administration has relied both on actively lying to its supporters (by telling them that the election was stolen — something Trump continued to do throughout the day) and on a kind of gamification of politics that flattens real consequences.

What snapped Tammy out, in her telling, was the realization that a real woman was shot and killed as she and other Trump supporters stormed the Capitol. Trump’s exaggerations were not merely harmless rhetoric; they directly got someone, a supporter of his, killed."	left
llzwo6	liberal	Rush Limbaugh, conservative media icon, dead at 70 following battle with cancer	"New York (CNN Business) Rush Limbaugh, the conservative media icon who for decades used his perch as the king of talk-radio to shape the politics of both the Republican Party and nation, died Wednesday after a battle with cancer. He was 70 years old.

Limbaugh's wife Kathryn made the announcement on his radio show Wednesday.

""As so many of you know, losing a loved one is terribly difficult, even more so when that loved one is larger than life,"" she said. ""Rush will forever be the greatest of all time.""

Limbaugh announced in February 2020 that he had been diagnosed with advanced lung cancer. Limbaugh continued to host his show while undergoing treatment, and he told listeners that he remained hopeful he would defeat the disease.

A pioneer of AM talk-radio, Limbaugh for 32 years hosted ""The Rush Limbaugh Show,"" a nationally-syndicated program with millions of loyal listeners that transfigured him into a partisan force and polarizing figure in American politics. In many ways, his radio show was like the big bang of the conservative media universe. ""The Rush Limbaugh Show"" helped popularize the political talk-radio format and usher in a generation of conservative infotainment.

Using his sizable platform, Limbaugh advanced conservative ideas, though he often waded into conspiratorial waters and generated controversy for hateful commentary on gender and race. During the course of his career, Limbaugh started a number of fires with his commentary.

Limbaugh offered a conditional apology after he accused actor Michael J. Fox of exaggerating his Parkinson's disease and apologized when he insulted law school student Sandra Fluke. He relentlessly attacked President Barack Obama, going as far as to fan the flames of birtherism, the discredited idea that Obama was born outside the United States and therefore not eligible to be president. And, in the last few years, he peddled ""deep state"" conspiracy theories, providing cover for former President Donald Trump during his term, who he counted as a friend.

More recently, Limbaugh appeared to approve of some forms of political violence in the immediate aftermath of the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. He also drew backlash at the outset of the pandemic when he dismissed the coronavirus as the ""common cold"" and contended that it was being ""weaponized"" by members of the mainstream press to bludgeon Trump and harm his re-election chances. The missive was classic Limbaugh, who built a career on expressing strong distrust of the established press order and referred to himself as ""America's Anchorman.""

Despite his penchant for pushing conspiracy theories and peddling misinformation that benefited Trump and the other political figures he supported over the years, Limbaugh acknowledged the weight of his words in a 2008 interview with The New York Times

""I take the responsibility that comes with my show very seriously,"" Limbaugh told the newspaper. ""I want to persuade people with ideas. I don't walk around thinking about my power. But in my heart and soul, I know I have become the intellectual engine of the conservative movement.""

'No one had heard anything like it before'

Rush Hudson Limbaugh III was born in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, to Rush Hudson Limbaugh Jr. and Mildred Carolyn Limbaugh. His father, Limbaugh Jr., was a prominent Republican activist. Limbaugh's younger brother, David Limbaugh, is a lawyer and conservative commentator.

From a young age, Limbaugh was interested in a career in radio. When he was 16 years old, Limbaugh enrolled in a summer course on radio engineering and earned a broadcaster's license. He soon landed a job in local radio. Limbaugh's father demanded he attend college, but Limbaugh had little interest.

""My father expected me to be a professional man,"" Limbaugh told The Times. ""The problem was, I hated school. I hated being told what to do. In the Boy Scouts, I never got a single merit badge. In school my grades were terrible. I just didn't want to be there. I just wanted to be on the radio.""

Limbaugh eventually attended Southeast Missouri State University for a year before dropping out. He struggled to find a stable career in radio, working at various stations, including as a top-40 DJ. Limbaugh also struggled in his personal life, having divorced two women in a span of 10 years.

Things changed when he moved to Sacramento, California, to work at KFBK-AM in 1984. From there, Limbaugh developed ""The Rush Limbaugh Show."" He struck success, doing well in the ratings and earning the attention of Ed McLaughlin, the former head of ABC Radio. In 1988, when Limbaugh's show became nationally syndicated, he moved to New York to broadcast from WABC.

""No one had heard anything like it before,"" Brian Rosenwald, author of ""Talk Radio's America,"" told Boston Public Radio Station WBUR in 2019. Rosenwald added, ""This is a guy who had been a DJ, gotten fired four times in the '70s but he took the high jinks from those DJs at times and infused it into a topical talk show where he was sort of applying it to the values that he had gotten at the dinner table from his father growing up.""

Limbaugh found immense success, and quickly became the king of talk-radio. President Ronald Reagan dubbed him the ""number one voice for conservatism"" in the country."" Limbaugh even had a brief stint on television, hosting a talk show from 1992 to 1996 produced by the late Roger Ailes. Limbaugh said he had no real rivals.

""I have no competitors,"" Limbaugh told The Times in 2008. ""[Sean] Hannity isn't even close to me.""

But he did have some personal setbacks. In 2001, Limbaugh suffered hearing loss due to an autoimmune inner ear disease. He later received a cochlear implant. In 2003, Limbaugh announced that he was addicted to pain medication and would seek treatment. Limbaugh said he had become addicted after back surgery. In 2006, he was charged with ""doctorshopping."" His attorney said he pleaded not guilty and that the charge would be dropped once he completed 18 months of drug treatment.

Throughout it all, Limbaugh remained the king of conservative talk-radio, earning a fortune along the way. Limbaugh had five houses. He expressed an affinity for expensive cars. And he owned a personal plane

At the time of the 2008 New York Times interview, Limbaugh was nearing a contract renewal with Premiere Radio Networks which he estimated was worth approximately $38 million a year. He told The Times that the contract included a nine-figure signing bonus. In January, Premiere Radio Networks told CNN Business that Limbaugh had renewed a ""long-term agreement,"" but did not disclose other details. Trump said at a rally, however, that it was for an additional four years.

""The most elemental fact about the Limbaugh career might be that, outside of seriously corrupt dictatorships, nobody has made as much money from politics as Rush Limbaugh,"" observed the journalist Michael Wolff, who profiled Limbaugh for Vanity Fair magazine in 2009.

In 2010, Limbaugh married his fourth wife, Kathryn Rogers , a 33-year-old event planner. Limbaugh paid a reported $1 million for Elton John to perform at the event, which was attended by members of the Republican elite, including Sean Hannity, Rudolph Giuliani, and Karl Rove.

Limbaugh was generous with his wealth. He once ranked fourth on Forbes' list of most generous celebrities, having donated $4.2 million to the Marine Corps Law Enforcement Foundation, about 13% of his earnings, the publication said. Limbaugh has also used his show to rally listeners to donate to various charities throughout the years, helping to raise millions of dollars for those in need. In recent years, he and his wife started the Rush and Kathryn Adams Limbaugh Family Foundation.

His generosity extended elsewhere, too. Jeremy Sullivan of Missouri's Kobe Club told Grub Street in 2008 that Limbaugh was someone who liked ""to throw down the most massive tips"" at restaurants. ""The last few times his tips have been $5,000,"" Sullivan said.

Limbaugh, however, was a sharply divisive figure. He was a Republican kingmaker with uncompromising positions. Republican politicians and operatives dared not cross his path. In 2009, when then-Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele dismissed Limbaugh as an ""entertainer,"" Limbaugh went on the attack. Steele later apologized.

In the last years of his life, Limbaugh, like most in conservative media, did everything in his power to protect Trump, resorting to peddling disinformation and conspiracy theories to his audience. He attacked the so-called ""deep state,"" Special Counsel Robert Mueller, and other perceived enemies of Trump.

When Trump faced an impeachment trial the first time in the Senate, Limbaugh went to bat for him each day. Limbaugh attacked then-candidate Joe Biden, while simultaneously defending Trump. Limbaugh told his listeners that Trump's only offense was being ""too successful.""

""He's being impeached because his successes threaten great damage to the Democrat Party,"" Limbaugh claimed.

During Trump's second impeachment, Limbaugh accused Democrats of advancing an ""abject lie"" about Trump's involvement in the insurrection as part of a political effort to disqualify him from running for office again. Limbaugh said Democrats were ""deathly afraid"" Trump would retain his power over the Republican Party and so they wanted to ""stop"" him ""from having a public life.""

Trump called into Fox News Wednesday to react to news of Limbaugh's passing.

He described Limbaugh as ""irreplaceable"" and ""unique,"" touting his ""massive audience.""

""He was a fantastic man, a fantastic talent, and people, whether they loved him or not, they respected him, they really did,"" Trump said.

Limbaugh announced in February 2020 that he had been diagnosed with advanced cancer. A day later, Trump awarded him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest honor a President can bestow on a civilian. The decision to award Limbaugh the medal ignited fury among those who pointed to the radio host's divisive rhetoric and inflammatory comments.

""Empathy is due to anyone who is suffering. But not high honors, not a celebration of a life's work devoted to the mockery and derision of the Other,"" wrote David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker. ""For the President of the United States to bestow one of the nation's highest laurels on Limbaugh is a morally corrosive and politically cynical act.""

Limbaugh, who had a close relationship with his radio audience, told his listeners that he appreciated the ""love and affection"" he had received, saying it was ""unlike anything I've ever dreamed of or experienced."" But he said he preferred not to talk often about his treatment or health.

""Let me remind you, I told you at the beginning of this that I'm very flattered by all of you who care,"" Limbaugh said.""Don't misunderstand. But I vowed not to let this take control of my life. I've seen that happen. It's hard not to. It's a terminal disease for a lot of people. It takes over your life. I've vowed to not let that happen as much as I can."""	left
ipjgr8	liberal	'Play it down': Trump admits to concealing the true threat of coronavirus in new Woodward book	"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump admitted he knew weeks before the first confirmed US coronavirus death that the virus was dangerous, airborne, highly contagious and ""more deadly than even your strenuous flus,"" and that he repeatedly played it down publicly, according to legendary journalist Bob Woodward in his new book ""Rage.""

""This is deadly stuff,"" Trump told Woodward on February 7.

In a series of interviews with Woodward, Trump revealed that he had a surprising level of detail about the threat of the virus earlier than previously known. ""Pretty amazing,"" Trump told Woodward, adding that the coronavirus was maybe five times ""more deadly"" than the flu.

Trump's admissions are in stark contrast to his frequent public comments at the time insisting that the virus was ""going to disappear"" and ""all work out fine.""

The book, using Trump's own words, depicts a President who has betrayed the public trust and the most fundamental responsibilities of his office. In ""Rage,"" Trump says the job of a president is ""to keep our country safe."" But in early February, Trump told Woodward he knew how deadly the virus was, and in March, admitted he kept that knowledge hidden from the public.

""I wanted to always play it down,"" Trump told Woodward on March 19, even as he had declared a national emergency over the virus days earlier. ""I still like playing it down, because I don't want to create a panic.""

If instead of playing down what he knew, Trump had acted decisively in early February with a strict shutdown and a consistent message to wear masks, social distance and wash hands, experts believe that thousands of American lives could have been saved.

The startling revelations in ""Rage,"" which CNN obtained ahead of its September 15 release, were made during 18 wide-ranging interviews Trump gave Woodward from December 5, 2019 to July 21, 2020. The interviews were recorded by Woodward with Trump's permission, and CNN has obtained copies of some of the audio tapes.

""Rage"" also includes brutal assessments of Trump's presidency from many of his former top national security officials, including former Defense Secretary James Mattis, former Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Mattis is quoted as calling Trump ""dangerous"" and ""unfit"" to be commander in chief. Woodward writes that Coats ""continued to harbor the secret belief, one that had grown rather than lessened, although unsupported by intelligence proof, that Putin had something on Trump."" Woodward continues, writing that Coats felt, ""How else to explain the president's behavior? Coats could see no other explanation.""

In this White House photo from December 2019 provided by Bob Woodward, President Donald Trump is seen speaking to Woodward in the Oval Office, surrounded by some aides and advisers, as well as Vice President Mike Pence. On Trump's desk is a large picture of Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

The book also contains harsh evaluations of the President's leadership on the virus from current officials.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the administration's top infectious disease expert, is quoted telling others Trump's leadership was ""rudderless"" and that his ""attention span is like a minus number.""

""His sole purpose is to get reelected,"" Fauci told an associate, according to Woodward.

Fauci responded to the quotes in a Fox News interview on Wednesday, saying he would question the account.

""If you notice, others have said that. You know, you should ask others. I don't recall that at all,"" Fauci said, adding that he ""didn't get any sense"" Trump was distorting things.

Trump responded to the Woodward book at a White House event Wednesday afternoon, defending his response to the pandemic and confirming he did not want to create a panic.

""Well, I think if you said in order to reduce panic, perhaps that's so,"" Trump said. ""The fact is I'm a cheerleader for this country. I love our country. And I don't want people to be frightened. I don't want to create panic, as you say, and certainly I'm not going to drive this country or the world into a frenzy. We want to show confidence. We want to show strength.""

'The virus has nothing to do with me'

Woodward reveals new details on the early warnings Trump received -- and often ignored.

In a January 28 top secret intelligence briefing, national security adviser Robert O'Brien gave Trump a ""jarring"" warning about the virus, telling the President it would be the ""biggest national security threat"" of his presidency. Trump's head ""popped up,"" Woodward writes.

O'Brien's deputy, Matt Pottinger, concurred, telling Trump it could be as bad as the influenza pandemic of 1918, which killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide, including 675,000 Americans. Pottinger warned Trump that asymptomatic spread was occurring in China: He had been told 50% of those infected showed no symptoms.

At that time, there were fewer than a dozen reported coronavirus cases in the US.

Three days later, Trump announced restrictions on travel from China, a move suggested by his national security team -- despite Trump's later claims that he alone backed the travel limitations.

Nevertheless, Trump continued to publicly downplay the danger of the virus. February was a lost month . Woodward views this as a damning missed opportunity for Trump to reset ""the leadership clock"" after he was told this was a ""once-in-a-lifetime health emergency.""

""Presidents are the executive branch. There was a duty to warn. To listen, to plan, and to take care,"" Woodward writes. But in the days following the January 28 briefing, Trump used high-profile appearances to minimize the threat and, Woodward writes, ""to reassure the public they faced little risk.""

During a pre-Super Bowl interview on Fox News February 2, Trump said, ""We pretty much shut it down coming in from China."" Two days later during his State of the Union address , Trump made only a passing reference to the virus, promising, ""my administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat.""

Asked by Woodward in May if he remembered O'Brien's January 28 warning that the virus would be the biggest national security threat of his presidency, Trump equivocated. ""No, I don't."" Trump said. ""I'm sure if he said it — you know, I'm sure he said it. Nice guy.""

The book highlights how the President took all of the credit and none of the responsibility for his actions related to the pandemic, which has infected 6 million Americans and killed more than 185,000 in the US.

""The virus has nothing to do with me,"" Trump told Woodward in their final interview in July. ""It's not my fault. It's — China let the damn virus out.""

'It goes through the air'

When Woodward spoke to Trump on February 7, two days after he was acquitted on impeachment charges by the Senate, Woodward expected a lengthy conversation about the trial. He was surprised, however, by the President's focus on the virus. At the same time that Trump and his public health officials were saying the virus was ""low risk,"" Trump divulged to Woodward that the night before he'd spoken to Chinese President Xi Jinping about the virus. Woodward quotes Trump as saying, ""We've got a little bit of an interesting setback with the virus going in China.""

""It goes through the air,"" Trump said. ""That's always tougher than the touch. You don't have to touch things. Right? But the air, you just breathe the air and that's how it's passed. And so that's a very tricky one. That's a very delicate one. It's also more deadly than even your strenuous flus.""

But Trump spent most of the next month saying that the virus was ""very much under control"" and that cases in the US would "" disappear ."" Trump said on his trip to India on February 25 that it was ""a problem that's going to go away,"" and the next day he predicted the number of US cases ""within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.""

By March 19, when Trump told Woodward he was purposely downplaying the dangers to avoid creating a panic, he also acknowledged the threat to young people. ""Just today and yesterday, some startling facts came out. It's not just old, older. Young people too, plenty of young people,"" Trump said.

Publicly, however, Trump has continued to insist just the opposite, saying as recently as August 5 that children were "" almost immune.

Even into April, when the US became the country with the most confirmed cases in the world, Trump's public statements contradicted his acknowledgements to Woodward. At an April 3 coronavirus task force briefing, Trump was still downplaying the virus and stating that it would go away. ""I said it's going away and it is going away,"" he said. Yet two days later on April 5, Trump again told Woodward, ""It's a horrible thing. It's unbelievable,"" and on April 13, he said, ""It's so easily transmissible, you wouldn't even believe it.""

'Dangerous' and 'unfit'

Woodward, a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, conducted hundreds of hours of confidential background interviews with firsthand witnesses for ""Rage,"" and he obtained ""notes, emails, diaries, calendars and confidential documents,"" including more than two dozen letters Trump exchanged with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un . Woodward is known to record his interviews with the permission of his subjects and sources.

He writes that when he attributes exact quotations, thoughts or conclusions, that information comes either from the person, a colleague with direct knowledge or documents.

Trump's conscious downplaying of the coronavirus is one of numerous revelations in ""Rage."" The book is filled with anecdotes about top Cabinet officials blindsided by tweets, frustrated with Trump's inability to focus and scared about his next policy directive because he refused to accept facts or listen to experts:

-- Mattis is quoted as saying Trump is ""dangerous,"" ""unfit,"" has ""no moral compass"" and took foreign policy actions that showed adversaries ""how to destroy America."" After Mattis left the administration, he and Coats discussed whether they needed to take ""collective action"" to speak out publicly against Trump. Mattis says he ultimately resigned after Trump announced he was withdrawing US troops from Syria, ""when I was basically directed to do something that I thought went beyond stupid to felony stupid.""

-- Woodward writes that Coats and his top staff members ""examined the intelligence as carefully as possible,"" and that Coats still questions the relationship between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""Coats saw how extraordinary it was for the president's top intelligence official to harbor such deep suspicions about the president's relationship with Putin. But he could not shake them.""

-- Trump has come under fire in recent days for reportedly making disparaging remarks about US military personnel and veterans. Woodward's book includes an anecdote where an aide to Mattis heard Trump say in a meeting, ""my f---ing generals are a bunch of pussies"" because they cared more about alliances than trade deals. Mattis asked the aide to document the comment in an email to him. And Trump himself criticized military officials to Woodward over their view that alliances with NATO and South Korea are the best bargain the US makes. ""I wouldn't say they were stupid, because I would never say that about our military people,"" Trump said. ""But if they said that, they -- whoever said that was stupid. It's a horrible bargain ... they make so much money. Costs us $10 billion. We're suckers.""

-- Woodward reports that Trump's national security team expressed concerns the US may have come close to nuclear war with North Korea amid provocations in 2017. ""We never knew whether it was real,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is quoted as saying, ""or whether it was a bluff."" But it was so serious that Mattis slept in his clothes to be ready in case there was a North Korean launch and repeatedly went to the Washington National Cathedral to pray.

-- Trump boasted to Woodward about a new secret weapons system. ""I have built a nuclear — a weapons system that nobody's ever had in this country before,"" Trump said. Woodward says other sources confirmed the information, without providing further details, but expressed surprise that Trump disclosed it.

-- Woodward obtained the 27 ""love letters"" Trump exchanged with Kim Jong Un, 25 of which have not been reported publicly. The letters, filled with flowery language, provide a fascinating window into their relationship. Kim flatters Trump by repeatedly calling him ""Your Excellency,"" and writes in one letter that meeting again would be ""reminiscent of a scene from a fantasy film."" In another, Kim writes that the ""deep and special friendship between us will work as a magical force."" CNN has obtained the transcripts of two of the letters

-- Trump's son-in-law and senior White House adviser Jared Kushner also weighs in with some unusual literary insights about his father-in-law. Kushner is quoted as saying that four texts are key to understanding Trump, including ""Alice in Wonderland."" Kushner paraphrased the Cheshire Cat: ""If you don't know where you're going, any path will get you there.""

-- Woodward pressed Trump on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's role in the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Once again, Trump dismissed the US intelligence assessment and defends bin Salman: ""He says very strongly that he didn't do it.""

-- Trump insulted his predecessors, saying Woodward made former President George W. Bush ""look like a stupid moron, which he was."" Trump said of former President Barack Obama: ""I don't think Obama's smart ... I think he's highly overrated. And I don't think he's a great speaker."" He also tells Woodward that Kim Jong Un thought Obama was an ""asshole.""

-- Woodward discussed the Black Lives Matter protests and suggested to the President that people like the two of them -- ""White, privileged"" -- need to work to understand the anger and pain that Black people feel in the US. ""You really drank the Kool-Aid, didn't you? Just listen to you,"" Trump responded, repeating his outrageous talking point that he's done more for the Black community than any president besides Abraham Lincoln.

-- Woodward reports new details on Russia's election meddling, writing that the NSA and CIA have classified evidence the Russians had placed malware in the election registration systems of at least two Florida counties, St. Lucie and Washington. While there was no evidence the malware had been activated, Woodward writes, it was sophisticated and could erase voters in specific districts. The voting system vendor used by Florida was also used in states across the country.

'Dynamite behind the door'

""Rage"" is a follow-up to Woodward's 2018 bestselling book ""Fear,"" which portrayed a chaotic White House in which aides hid papers from Trump to protect the country from what they viewed as his most dangerous impulses.

While Trump slammed ""Fear,"" he also complained that he didn't speak to Woodward for the book, which resulted in his agreeing to extensive interviews for ""Rage.""

However, on August 14, Trump preemptively attacked Woodward's new book, tweeting, ""The Bob Woodward book will be a FAKE, as always, just as many of the others have been.""

Throughout the book, Trump provides insights into his view of the presidency. He tells Woodward when you're running the country, ""There's dynamite behind every door.""

After his 18 interviews, Woodward issues a stark verdict: Trump is the ""dynamite behind the door."" Woodward concludes his book with a declaration that ""Trump is the wrong man for the job.""

hbl8g3	liberal	Say It Under Oath, Asshole.	"Let our journalists help you make sense of the noise: Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter and get a recap of news that matters.

Last October, President Donald Trump said, on television, that “China should start an investigation into the Bidens” and reiterated his previously private push for Ukraine to investigate the former vice president and his son Hunter. That may have seemed to many people like a public confession to the misconduct that would lead to Trump’s impeachment: soliciting foreign interference in the 2020 election. Some of Trump’s defenders, however, said that Trump wasn’t seriously asking China for election help, or something like that.

Bolton is indeed a kind of whistleblower. But he might be the least courageous one in American history.

That, it turns out, could have been John Bolton’s moment. Bolton—who, a month earlier, either quit or was fired as Trump’s national security adviser, depending on who you believe—was invited on October 30 to give a deposition as part of the House’s impeachment inquiry. He refused. (Bolton later offered to testify as part of the Senate’s impeachment trial if subpoenaed, but only after it was fairly evident that Senate Republicans would refuse to call any witnesses. Some damning details from his book leaked during the trial.)

On Wednesday, Bolton, who is hawking a memoir about his time in “The Room Where it Happened,” told the world that he knows something about Trump’s efforts to seek assistance from the Chinese government for his reelection campaign. According to reports in the New York Times and the Washington Post, Bolton writes that in a June 29, 2019, meeting, Trump pleaded with Chinese President Xi Jinping to help Trump’s electoral prospects by purchasing US agricultural products—and thus improving Trump’s standing in rural states hurt by his trade war with China. The newspapers obtained Bolton’s book a day after the Justice Department sued Bolton to try to block its publication. The administration asserts the book reveals classified information, a claim that Bolton disputes.

Bolton also shared this information in an excerpt published by the Wall Street Journal:

In their meeting in Osaka on June 29, Xi told Trump that the U.S.-China relationship was the most important in the world. He said that some (unnamed) American political figures were making erroneous judgments by calling for a new cold war with China.

Whether Xi meant to finger the Democrats or some of us sitting on the U.S. side of the table, I don’t know, but Trump immediately assumed that Xi meant the Democrats. Trump said approvingly that there was great hostility to China among the Democrats. Trump then, stunningly, turned the conversation to the coming U.S. presidential election, alluding to China’s economic capability and pleading with Xi to ensure he’d win. He stressed the importance of farmers and increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome.

Bolton added that he “would print Trump’s exact words, but the government’s prepublication review process has decided otherwise.”

Bolton also writes that Trump told Xi that China’s decision to detain Uighur Muslims in concentration camps was, in Bolton’s paraphrasing, “exactly the right thing to do.” Trump, according to Bolton, encouraged the Chinese leader “go ahead with building the camps.”

That’s not all. Bolton’s book alleges that Trump expressed a willingness to stop US criminal investigations “to, in effect, give personal favors to dictators he liked,” according to the Times. “The pattern looked like obstruction of justice as a way of life, which we couldn’t accept,” Bolton writes.

Bolton says Trump told Xi he would intervene with the Justice Department to help Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE, which agreed in 2017 to plead guilty to violating American sanctions on doing business with North Korea, Iran, and other countries. Bolton says Trump told Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in May 2018 that he would intervene to block the DOJ’s prosecution of a Turkish state-owned bank, which was accused of violating US sanctions on Iran. Trump “told Erdogan he would take care of things, explaining that the Southern District [of New York] prosecutors were not his people, but were Obama people, a problem that would be fixed when they were replaced by his people,” Bolton writes, according to the Post. CNN has reported that Attorney General William Barr, under pressure from Trump, did try to stave off Halkbank’s indictment by federal prosecutors in Manhattan.

Bolton apparently feels that the House, rather than impeaching Trump merely for pressuring Ukraine, should have investigated the president over the various other instances in which he meddled with law enforcement or sought electoral assistance from foreign powers. In this, Bolton shares the view of many liberal critics who believed the House should have impeached Trump for a broader swath of crimes and misconduct.

The House Intelligence Committee could still subpoena Bolton. So could other House committees, such as Judiciary, given his claims about DOJ investigations. Spokespersons for those panels declined to comment on whether they might do so. But it appears likely that Bolton missed his chance to tell lawmakers under oath why they should remove the president from office.

Bolton is trying to publish a book, prior to Election Day, that details why Trump is a bad president. That earns him support from Trump’s critics. Bolton is indeed a kind of whistleblower. But he might be the least courageous one in American history. The Times calls him a “complicated, controversial figure.” Not really. He’s a jerk promoting himself—one who waited far too long to tell the truth.

Last fall, patriotic civil servants—including former Bolton subordinates Fiona Hill and Alexander Vindman and former US ambassadors to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and William Taylor—risked their careers and endured slander to testify truthfully about Trump’s efforts to corrupt US foreign policy. The witnesses appeared in the House Ways and Means hearing room. That was “the room where it happened.” Bolton didn’t show up."	left

(CN) — President Donald Trump illegally circumvented Congress’ “power of the purse” by transferring $2.5 billion in Department of Defense funds to construct portions of the border wall in California, Arizona and New Mexico, the Ninth Circuit found Friday in a pair of rulings.

In an 102-page ruling, Chief U.S. Circuit Judge Sidney Thomas, a Bill Clinton appointee, found Trump violated the Appropriations Clause of the Constitution by illegally authorizing the transfer of Pentagon funds to cover border wall construction expenses in El Paso, Texas, and El Centro, California, along the southwest U.S.-Mexico border.

“The panel concluded that the district court correctly determined that the border wall was not an unforeseen military requirement, and that funding for the wall had been denied by Congress. Absent such statutory authority, the Executive Branch lacked independent constitutional authority to transfer the funds at issue here,” Thomas wrote, ruling in favor of California, New Mexico and a host of other states.

Without the illegally transferred funds, Thomas noted there would be inadequate funding to complete Trump’s border wall construction project, “and this would prevent both the alleged and environmental and sovereign injuries.”

Applauding the ruling, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said “the court reminded the president — once again — that no one is above the law.”

“While the Trump Administration steals public funds to build an unauthorized wall at the southern border, families across the country are struggling to pay their bills. They deserve to know that their hard-earned dollars are going where the law intended — to benefit their families and their communities,” Becerra said in a statement.

The panel found California and New Mexico had standing to bring their claims, by showing “the actions of the federal defendants will cause particularized and concrete injuries in fact to the environment and wildlife of their respective states as well as their sovereign interests in enforcing their environmental laws.”

In the lengthy order, Thomas provided a detailed summary of the circumstances which led to the illegal transfer of funds at issue in the two Ninth Circuit orders.

Trump had invoked Section 8005 and Section 9002 of the DOD Appropriations Act of 2019 to divert federal funds appropriated for other military purposes to fund border wall construction.

Following the longest government shutdown in United States history during the 2018-19 impasse over federal budget negotiations, Trump issued a proclamation under the National Emergencies Act “that a national emergency exists at the southern border of the United States,” according to Thomas’ summary.

But those sections of the Appropriations Act explicitly limit the transfer of funds “in no case where the item for which the funds are requested has been denied by the Congress,” according to the ruling.

“Section 8005 does not confer a private right of action. Instead, it delegates a narrow slice of Congress’s appropriation power to DOD to allow the agency to respond flexibly to unforeseen circumstances implicating the national interest,” Thomas wrote.

“Section 8005’s limitations protect California’s and New Mexico’s sovereign interests, just as they protect Congress’s constitutional interests, because they ensure that, ordinarily, Executive action cannot override these interests without congressional approval and funding,” he added.

The provision allowing for the transfer of funds had been invoked to pay for hurricane and typhoon damage to military bases, “natural disasters that inflict damage that may not be anticipated or expected ahead of time,” Thomas wrote.

But drug smuggling across the U.S.-Mexico border “was not unanticipated or unexpected here,” Thomas found.

“Congress’s joint resolution terminating the president’s declaration of a national emergency only reinforces this point: there was no unanticipated crisis at the border. Nothing prevented Congress from funding solutions to this problem through the ordinary appropriations process — Congress simply chose not to fund this particular solution,” Thomas wrote.

In a second 82-page order in a similar lawsuit brought by the Sierra Club and Southern Border Communities Coalition, Thomas reiterated Congress, not the president, has the exclusive power to determine how federal funds are allocated.

“The Appropriations Clause of the U.S. Constitution exclusively grants the power of the purse to Congress. The panel held that the transfer of funds violated the Appropriations Clause, and, therefore, was unlawful,” Thomas wrote, joined in both opinions by U.S. Circuit Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw, also a Clinton appointee.

U.S. Circuit Judge Daniel Collins, a Trump appointee, dissented in both orders, arguing the states lacked cause of action to challenge the transfer of funds under the Administrative Procedure Act.

The Justice Department declined to comment on the rulings.

ACLU National Security Project senior attorney Dror Ladin called the ruling “a win for the rule of law, the environment, and border communities.”

“President Trump’s xenophobic wall is already leveling protected lands, desecrating cultural sites, and destroying wildlife. There’s no undoing the damage that’s been done, but we will be back before the Supreme Court to finally put a stop to this destructive wall,” Ladin said in a statement."	left

Driving the news: The president told ""Axios on HBO"" that he never raised the issue with his Russian counterpart, despite speaking to Putin at least eight times since intelligence about the alleged bounties was reportedly included in the President's Daily Brief in late February.

""That was a phone call to discuss other things, and frankly, that’s an issue that many people said was fake news,"" Trump told Axios' Jonathan Swan.

What they're saying: ""The most critical and sacred obligation of a commander-in-chief is to protect those who serve our nation in harm's way,"" the Biden campaign's rapid response director Andrew Bates said in a statement."	left
mh633z	liberal	Matt Gaetz Is Said to Face Justice Dept. Inquiry Over Sex With an Underage Girl	"[Read more on what we know about the investigation of Matt Gaetz.]

The three people said that the examination of Mr. Gaetz, 38, is part of a broader investigation into a political ally of his, a local official in Florida named Joel Greenberg, who was indicted last summer on an array of charges, including sex trafficking of a child and financially supporting people in exchange for sex, at least one of whom was an underage girl.

Mr. Greenberg, who has since resigned his post as tax collector in Seminole County, north of Orlando, visited the White House with Mr. Gaetz in 2019, according to a photograph that Mr. Greenberg posted on Twitter.

No charges have been brought against Mr. Gaetz, and the extent of his criminal exposure is unclear.

Mr. Gaetz said in an interview that his lawyers had been in touch with the Justice Department and that they were told he was the subject, not the target, of an investigation. “I only know that it has to do with women,” Mr. Gaetz said. “I have a suspicion that someone is trying to recategorize my generosity to ex-girlfriends as something more untoward.”

Mr. Gaetz called the investigation part of an elaborate scheme involving “false sex allegations” to extort him and his family for $25 million that began this month. He said he and his father, Don Gaetz, had been cooperating with the F.B.I. and “wearing a wire” after they were approached by people saying they could make the investigation “go away.” Mr. Gaetz claimed the disclosure of the sex trafficking inquiry was intended to thwart an investigation into the extortion plot.

In a second interview later Tuesday, the congressman said he had no plans to resign his House seat and denied that he had romantic relationships with minors. “It is verifiably false that I have traveled with a 17-year-old woman,” he said."	left
gik4kg	liberal	A Pennsylvania mask factory scrapped a visit from Trump because it worried the event could spread the coronavirus	"A visit by President Donald Trump to a Pennsylvania mask factory last week was postponed over concerns that his visit could help spread the coronavirus, The Washington Post reported on Monday.

Trump was due to go to a Braskem factory last Friday, but the factory asked him not to come, saying it could harm workers' safety and the factory's mask output, The Post reported.

Trump was criticized earlier this month for visiting another mask factory while not wearing one.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

A Pennsylvania mask factory postponed a visit from President Donald Trump last week because it worried that the event could spread the coronavirus among workers.

The Washington Post reported on Monday that Trump was due to visit a Braskem factory on Friday to thank workers who are making personal protective equipment.

Citing documents and two people familiar with the decision, The Post said factory bosses asked to postpone the visit over concerns that Trump's visit could jeopardize workers' safety and harm the factory's ability to make the materials for masks and other medical supplies.

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have been criticized for how they have handled similar events.

In early May, Trump was pictured touring a Honeywell mask-making factory without wearing a mask himself, though he later said he wore a mask ""backstage.""

Trump and Pence also work with at least a dozen people who have tested positive for the coronavirus over the past week, including Pence's press secretary, Katie Miller, and one of Trump's valets.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that anyone who has been exposed to someone who has the coronavirus stay at home for at least 14 days.

The CDC has also asked Americans to wear cloth face coverings in public, and Trump has ordered White House staffers to follow the guidance.

But The Post has also reported that Trump is not following the rule and thinks it is unnecessary because he is regularly tested for the virus.

Trump said in April after the CDC released its new guidance, ""I don't think I'm going to be doing it.""

He added: ""Wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens — I just don't see it.""

The Associated Press reported last week that Trump was concerned that wearing a mask in public would make him look bad on TV and harm his reelection chances."	left

Thomas, a conservative lobbyist and zealous supporter of Donald Trump, has fervently defended the president over the last four years. On her Facebook page, she frequently promotes baseless conspiracy theories about a “coup” against Trump led by Jewish philanthropist George Soros, a frequent target of anti-Semitic hate. Thomas draws many of these theories from fringe corners of the internet, including an anti-vax Facebook group that claimed Bill Gates would use the COVID vaccine to kill people. In recent months, she also amplified unsubstantiated corruption claims against Joe Biden while insisting, falsely, that the Obama administration illegally spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign, then tried to rig the election against him.

In turn, Trump has rewarded Thomas with an extraordinary amount of access to the Oval Office. Her advocacy group Groundswell got an audience with the president in early 2019. According to the New York Times, the meeting was arranged after Clarence and Ginni Thomas had dinner with the Trumps. (Clarence Thomas and Trump appear to be quite friendly: The justice took his clerks to meet with the president in the Oval Office at least once; Ginni attended as well.) At the White House, Groundswell’s members lobbied Trump against transgender service in the military, which he already prohibited in 2017. The ban took effect in 2019, around the time of Groundswell’s meeting, after the Supreme Court lifted lower court orders blocking it by a 5–4 vote. (Clarence Thomas did not recuse himself from the case; he has never recused from any case because of his wife’s lobbying activities.) The New York Times also reported that Ginni Thomas compiled lists of federal employees whom she deemed insufficiently loyal to the president. She sent her lists to Trump, urging him to fire the disloyal employees, though he seems to have largely ignored her. He has, however, stacked his administration with former Thomas clerks.

Throughout the 2020 campaign, Thomas remained active on Facebook, condemning Black Lives Matter, opposing COVID-19 shutdowns, and touting the “Walk Away” movement, which purports to spotlight Democrats who became Republicans under Trump. (At least two individuals featured in the “Walk Away” series, both Black, were actually models from royalty-free stock photos.) She also campaigned for Trump in person—and, according to the Intercept, spearheaded a dark-money operation to support the president. Cleta Mitchell, the Republican lawyer who participated in Trump’s shakedown of the Georgia secretary of state, led the project.

After Nov. 3, Thomas grew uncharacteristically quiet on Facebook; she did not share popular conspiracy theories about election fraud, perhaps because election challenges would inevitably come before her husband. She provided her clearest statement yet on Jan. 6, when she enthusiastically endorsed the D.C. rally designed to make Congress overturn the election result and give Trump a second term. There is no evidence that Thomas personally attended the rally, and her posts indicate that she watched the events on TV from another location.

Ginni Thomas’ activism on matters that come before her husband raises thorny ethical issues. Federal law requires justices to recuse themselves from any proceeding in which their “impartiality might reasonably be questioned.” It also compels justices to recuse if their spouse has “an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome” of the case. In the coming months and years, Democrats will likely pressure Clarence Thomas to recuse himself from high-profile cases or to resign altogether. If Thomas steps down under Biden, progressives can restore a 5–4 divide on the Supreme Court, giving Chief Justice John Roberts control once again. Given Thomas’ staunch refusal to recuse thus far, though, there is little chance that he will take any steps to remediate his conflicts of interest, let alone retire during the presidency of a man he openly despises.

In all likelihood, Ginni Thomas will face no consequences for cheerleading a rally that sought to overturn an election, then laid siege to the Capitol in a failed insurrection. Her husband will ignore the controversy and continue to rule on cases that involve his wife’s lobbying efforts. We may never know how much influence a conspiracy theorist has on the highest court’s most conservative justice."	left
ld4z55	liberal	Marjorie Taylor Greene has been stripped of her committee assignments. What's next?	"(CNN) The Democrat-led House of Representatives voted on Thursday to remove Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from her committee assignments, but that doesn't mean the backlash against her -- or the spotlight on her -- is at an end.

Greene, a freshman from Georgia, remains a member of Congress and will still be able to vote. But she has quickly become one of the most controversial lawmakers during her short time in office. That has elevated her profile in right-wing and conservative circles and given her more of a platform -- and some Democrats won't be satisfied that she's been sufficiently rebuked with the removal of her committee assignments alone.

Greene defended herself ahead of the vote in a speech on the House floor and attempted to distance herself from the dangerous and debunked QAnon conspiracy theory, which she has previously embraced.

But Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez of California, who has introduced a resolution to expel Greene, told reporters he still believes she should be removed from Congress even after watching her floor remarks. The congressman said of his resolution, ""I'm committed to bringing it up, and I said that to leadership that there needs to be a vote sooner rather or later on this.""

Gomez said that the reason why he is pursuing a resolution to expel Greene ""is to send a message that this kind of discourse in our politics is not acceptable, inciting political violence, threatening people as is not acceptable and a person like that should not hold a position in the House of Representatives."""	left

idz21z	liberal	Joe Biden urges Americans to choose hope over fear in accepting Democratic nomination for president	"(CNN) Joe Biden formally accepted the nomination of his party Thursday night, arguing that America will choose hope over fear, facts over fiction and fairness over privilege as he cast President Donald Trump as a failed leader who has shirked responsibility while stoking hate and division.

The former vice president said the United States has faced an unprecedented ""perfect storm"" of four simultaneous crises: the worst pandemic in 100 years, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the most compelling call for racial justice since the Civil Rights Era and the climate crisis.

""Our current President has failed in his most basic duty to the nation. He has failed to protect us, he has failed to protect America,"" Biden said.

""This is not a partisan moment. This must be an American moment,"" he said, l ooking directly into the camera and telling voters he was running to reclaim the country's character at a time of darkness. ""This campaign isn't just about winning votes, it is about winning the heart and, yes, the soul of America.""

Though politicians often argue that each election is the most important, this year is different, he said: ""We know in our bones, this one is more consequential.""

While many speakers throughout the night told stories about Biden's life and his political career to highlight his empathy and decency -- and make the affirmative case for electing him -- Biden forcefully outlined how he would handle the job differently than Trump. He condemned the President for failing to devise a plan to get the coronavirus under control, while arguing that the incumbent wasted precious time focusing on his own grievances and political desires instead of trying to save lives.

""The President keeps telling us the virus is going to disappear. He keeps waiting for a miracle,"" Biden said. ""Well, I have news for him: no miracle is coming. We lead the world in confirmed cases. We lead the world in deaths. Our economy is in tatters, with Black, Latino, Asian American and Native American communities bearing the brunt of it.""

""And after all this time, the President still does not have a plan,"" Biden continued. ""Well, I do.""

The speech marked the high point of a decorated career in politics that has seen the Scranton, Pennsylvania, native rise to the highest levels of government despite a lifetime of family tragedy. Biden had run for president twice before, never going far in those runs and the third try seemed destined to end the same way until a turning point win in South Carolina in late February.

The former vice president then swept through the Super Tuesday states and clinched the nomination, culminating in a four-day virtual celebration that aimed to promote him as an empathetic leader who would be guided by science as the nation is gripped by the greatest crisis it has confronted in generations.

In a poignant moment, Biden's three children introduced their father's keynote speech in a video. The former vice president's son Beau, who died of brain cancer five years ago at the age of 46, was portrayed in video clips from previous speeches about his father. Biden strongly pushed for such an introduction, which also featured his son Hunter and daughter Ashley.

The former vice president decided after much soul searching not to pursue a presidential campaign in 2016, saying the window for a run had closed while he was mourning Beau.

""Take it away, Beau,"" Ashley Biden said, as the video cut to Beau Biden giving a speech about his father at a previous convention.

The final night of the convention featured average Americans whose lives have been touched by the former vice president, from military families to 13-year-old Brayden Harrington, who approached Biden in New Hampshire asking him to help coach him through overcoming his stutter, as Biden did in his own youth by reciting poetry in the mirror and later by marking his speeches as a reminder not to rush through his remarks.

""I'm just a regular kid, and in a short amount of time, Joe Biden made me feel more confident about something that's bothered me my whole life,"" Harrington said. ""Joe Biden cared. Imagine what he could do for all of us. Kids like me are counting on you to elect someone we can all look up to. Someone who cares. Someone who will make our country and the world feel better. We're counting on you to elect Joe Bide.""

The evening opened with a series of videos giving testimony to Biden's humanity. One woman, Amanda Litman -- executive director of Run For Something, a progressive organization -- told how the former vice president consoled her family when a close relative was gravely ill with colon cancer.

She then used the experience to suggest how Biden could bring such empathy to bear in a nation in the grip of a pandemic that has already killed more than 170,000 people.

""Our entire country is grieving. We are all going through trauma. Our next President needs to be the one helping us heal,"" she said.

The tributes to Biden from current and former members of the military included speeches from former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who ran against the former Delaware senator for the 2020 presidential nomination, and Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq War veteran and Purple Heart recipient who Biden considered during his vice presidential selection process.

Duckworth spoke about the qualities needed in a commander in chief and the attention they must pay to the needs of military spouses, noting how her own husband rushed to the hospital to take care of her after she was injured when a rocket-propelled grenade tore through the helicopter she had been flying over Iraq in 2004.

""Military service doesn't just take courage and sacrifice from those in uniform -- they're required from their families, too,"" Duckworth said. ""Joe Biden understands those sacrifices because he has made them himself. When his son Beau enlisted in the Army and deployed to Iraq, that burden was shouldered by his family as well.""

She said US service members deserve a leader who would ""actually honor their sacrifices"" and that they don't have that in their current commander in chief, because Trump ""is either unwilling or incapable of doing so.""

When Buttigieg, who was a lieutenant in the US Navy Reserves, endorsed Biden earlier this year, the former vice president took the microphone to invoke his late son, an Iraq War veteran who Biden refers to as his ""soul.""

""I don't think I've ever done this before, but he reminds me of my son, Beau,"" Biden said, with Buttigieg looking on. ""I know that may not mean much to most people, but to me, it's the highest compliment I can give any man or woman.""

On Thursday night, Buttigieg also spoke about his military service and his experience as a gay man in America watching how the country has shifted on LGBTQ rights.

""Joe Biden is right: this is a contest for the soul of the nation. And to me, that contest is not between good Americans and evil Americans. It's the struggle to call out what is good in every American,"" Buttigieg said.

""It's up to us. Will America be a place where faith is about healing and not exclusion? Can we become a country that lives up to the truth that Black lives matter? Will we handle questions of science and medicine by turning to scientists and doctors? Will we see to it that no one who works full time can live in poverty?"" he said.

""I trust Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to guide us toward that better future, because I have seen -- up close -- their empathy, and their capacity -- just as I've seen America's capacity to move toward inclusion.""

ib6n6i	liberal	Pelosi calls back House over Postal Service upheaval. A vote is expected Saturday to bar Trump overhaul plan for USPS.	"POLITICO Dispatch: August 17 No crowd. No balloons. Almost no risk of spreading a highly contagious virus. Sounds … thrilling, right? We break down why this year’s Democratic convention could make it tougher than ever to energize viewers.

""That is why I am calling upon the House to return to session later this week to vote on Oversight and Reform Committee Chairwoman [Carolyn] Maloney’s 'Delivering for America Act,' which prohibits the Postal Service from implementing any changes to operations or level of service it had in place on January 1, 2020.""

Pelosi said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) would formally announce the new schedule on a call with members set for Monday. The next set of House votes had orignally been slated for the week of Sept. 14 before this latest uproar.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), a Trump ally, claimed Democrats are trying to focus on the Postal Service's problems because they weren't able to reach a deal with the White House over a new coronavirus relief package.

“Republicans are 100 percent committed to ensuring a fair and accurate election. Whether Americans choose to vote in-person — which Doctor Fauci has stated will be safe — or vote absentee, I have complete confidence in the integrity of our electoral process,"" McCarthy said in a statement. ""House Democrats are simply attempting to distract from the fact their ridiculous demands are dragging down the American recovery and adding more uncertainty to people’s livelihoods.”

But House Democrats signaled this weekend that they will mount aggressive oversight of DeJoy, a Trump donor and loyalist, and have demanded the postmaster general appear for an emergency committee hearing on Monday, Aug. 24.

Pelosi and Maloney announced the hearing this weekend, warning that the agency’s changes “are slowing the mail and jeopardizing the integrity of the election.” Democrats in both the House and Senate had already demanded a slew of documents from DeJoy and his top staff, seeking details on why DeJoy had cracked down on overtime hours, restricted certain deliveries and offered conflicting information on the timeline for mail-in ballots."	left

jhw2jq	liberal	"""The vote is the most powerful nonviolent change agent you have in a democratic society. You must use it because it is not guaranteed."" — John Lewis"	"Though I was surrounded by two loving parents, plenty of brothers, sisters and cousins, their love could not protect me from the unholy oppression waiting just outside that family circle. Unchecked, unrestrained violence and government-sanctioned terror had the power to turn a simple stroll to the store for some Skittles or an innocent morning jog down a lonesome country road into a nightmare. If we are to survive as one unified nation, we must discover what so readily takes root in our hearts that could rob Mother Emanuel Church in South Carolina of her brightest and best, shoot unwitting concertgoers in Las Vegas and choke to death the hopes and dreams of a gifted violinist like Elijah McClain.

Like so many young people today, I was searching for a way out, or some might say a way in, and then I heard the voice of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on an old radio. He was talking about the philosophy and discipline of nonviolence. He said we are all complicit when we tolerate injustice. He said it is not enough to say it will get better by and by. He said each of us has a moral obligation to stand up, speak up and speak out. When you see something that is not right, you must say something. You must do something. Democracy is not a state. It is an act, and each generation must do its part to help build what we called the Beloved Community, a nation and world society at peace with itself.

Ordinary people with extraordinary vision can redeem the soul of America by getting in what I call good trouble, necessary trouble. Voting and participating in the democratic process are key. The vote is the most powerful nonviolent change agent you have in a democratic society. You must use it because it is not guaranteed. You can lose it.

You must also study and learn the lessons of history because humanity has been involved in this soul-wrenching, existential struggle for a very long time. People on every continent have stood in your shoes, through decades and centuries before you. The truth does not change, and that is why the answers worked out long ago can help you find solutions to the challenges of our time. Continue to build union between movements stretching across the globe because we must put away our willingness to profit from the exploitation of others.

Though I may not be here with you, I urge you to answer the highest calling of your heart and stand up for what you truly believe. In my life I have done all I can to demonstrate that the way of peace, the way of love and nonviolence is the more excellent way. Now it is your turn to let freedom ring.

When historians pick up their pens to write the story of the 21st century, let them say that it was your generation who laid down the heavy burdens of hate at last and that peace finally triumphed over violence, aggression and war. So I say to you, walk with the wind, brothers and sisters, and let the spirit of peace and the power of everlasting love be your guide.

The Trump administration has been hoping for its mythical, V-shaped recovery, where the employment shoots back up after crashing to its lowest depths since 1947. They'll have to keep waiting..

The United States added 1.8 million jobs in July, well below the nearly 5 million added in June. That leaves the country’s unemployment rate over 10%, with net loss of nearly 13 million jobs since the onset of the pandemic in February, according to the latest jobs report released Thursday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Over 16 million people remain unemployed, according to the BLS, and the number of people who have been without a job for between 15 and 26 weeks increased to 6.5 million people from 4.6 million in June. Those who were jobless for between 5 and 14 weeks fell from 6.3 million in June to 5.2 million people in July.

The July numbers mark a sharp slowdown from the big job gains over the previous two months, which followed the economy essentially falling apart and states shut down non-essential businesses during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March and April. Most states have allowed most businesses to reopen at this point with social distancing and mask requirements.

“The easy hiring that was done in May and June has been exhausted,” Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America, told the New York Times. “With many companies not running at full capacity, it becomes harder to get that incremental worker back in.”

The numbers also reflect a discrepancy in the recovery for workers of color. While the unemployment rate for white adults was just over 9%, the unemployment rate for Black adults was nearly 15%, nearly 13% for Latinx workers, and 12% for Asian workers in July.

The new jobs numbers come as Congress and the White House have struggled to reach a deal on a second coronavirus relief package that extends federal unemployment benefits; Democrats have generally pushed for extending the $600 weekly benefit until the economic and public health crisis stabilizes, while Republicans want to cut the weekly amount because they say the $600 a week disincentives returning to work.

For months, the Trump administration has indicated it believes that the economic recovery will look like a “V.” The second quarter of 2020 was the bottom — by far the worst period since the government began tracking job numbers in the 1940s and about four times worse than the lowest stretch of the Great Recession.

“I still think the V-shaped recovery is in place,” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said last month. “I don’t deny that some of these hot-spot states are going to moderate that recovery, but on the whole the picture is very positive.”

But the July jobs numbers undercut that prediction, as well as President Donald Trump’s long-held belief that the U.S. was going to have a “phenomenal” or at least “very good” economic third quarter. (More than a million people filed new jobless claims for the 20th straight week, the Department of Labor said Thursday.)

After boasting that the nearly five million jobs gained in June was “historic” and evidence that “our economy is roaring back,” Trump opted for a more low-key response to Friday’s news in a morning tweet: “Great Jobs Numbers!”

As of Friday morning, more than 4.8 million people have tested positive for coronavirus and nearly 160,000 people have died, according to the New York Times."	left
hc05cl	liberal	Trumps racist baby tweet gets slapped with manipulated media label	"President Donald Trump speaks during a roundtable discussion with African American supporters in the Cabinet Room of the White House on June 10, 2020.

A doctored viral video shared by President Donald Trump on Twitter has been labeled as ""manipulated media"" by the microblogging site as it looks to clean up disinformation.

The video shows a White toddler chasing a Black child down the street, and the banner says, ""Terrified todler runs from racist baby."" It is made to look like it was produced by CNN and the word ""toddler"" is misspelled.

The text changes to read: ""Racist baby probably a Trump voter.""

The mood and music changes subsequently to show what actually happened. It displays the scene before the chase, and shows that the two children were actually friends who were running to meet and hug each other.

The video concludes with text that says, ""America is not the problem,"" and a separate caption says, ""fake news is."" The irony is that this particular video was doctored.

Twitter has slapped the tweet with a ""manipulated media"" label. The company explains that it ""may label Tweets that include media (videos, audio, and images) that have been deceptively altered or fabricated.""

It says that users are not allowed to ""share deceptively altered media on Twitter in ways that mislead or deceive people about the media's authenticity where threats to physical safety or other serious harm may result.""

CNN actually reported on these two toddlers — Maxwell and Finnegan — in September 2019. Here is a tweet that shows part of the real video.

The video went viral last year and has resurfaced due to the killing of George Floyd, a Black man who died in police custody. Floyd's death has ignited discussions over racial inequality and the Black Lives Matter movement.

The parents of the two children responded to Trump's tweet.

""He will not turn this loving, beautiful video to further his hate agenda,"" Maxwell's dad, Michael Cisneros, wrote on Facebook."	left
gxb7ir	liberal	Yes, America Will Be Stronger Than the Thug Who Happens to Be Its President	"“American history isn’t a fairy tale,” Joe Biden said from Philadelphia City Hall Tuesday morning. “The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push and pull for 240 years. At our best the American ideal wins out. But it’s never a rout. It’s always a fight.”

It is, and maybe more people are joining it. I’ve noticed something interesting on my Facebook feed over these recent harrowing days. A number of people I have known for many years who aren’t usually very political—and more interestingly, some who are political but are conservative—have been posting statements in support of justice for George Floyd’s family. Even expressing outrage over his death and condemnations of police brutality.

Just an anecdote, but I think it means something—that Floyd’s death, and the context in which it occurred, may represent some tipping point where we as a nation collectively see the nature of an injustice in a way we didn’t before. Perhaps it’s the accumulation of all these police shootings and beatings we’ve seen in recent years on cable news. Eventually, the indifferent or even hostile heart and mind succumb to the evidence.

When I wrote “people” above, I meant mostly white people, I realize; but that’s significant. If white people who aren’t social-justice types are finally imagining what it’s like to have to fear getting killed or having your children killed for a minor transgression or no transgression at all, that’s a good thing. That’s how the world improves. That’s empathy. More importantly, it’s civic empathy.

Empathy is being able to imagine what another is experiencing. But civic empathy is something more—it’s being able to imagine another’s experiences as a member of society, and how the rules of the society affect that person. Civic empathy is the soul of democracy, especially a democracy as multi-ethnic as ours. In a largely homogeneous society, civic empathy is easy; indeed it doesn’t even come into play, because if everyone else is like you (racially, religiously, etc.), you don’t have to use your imagination at all.

But when people are different, civic empathy is vital. Civic empathy enables us to imagine—as white people, say—what it’s like to be a black man driving home who doesn’t come to a full stop at a stop sign and sees a police light in his rear-view mirror. For a white man, that’s an annoyance. For a black man, it could end in death. When enough white people accept that reality, then we’ve located a moral intersection of shared interests. Then, we move forward. And we understand that doing so is the best face of America, representing our best moments.

Meanwhile, in the White House, we have a president who isn’t just uninterested in civic empathy. He is its enemy. He regards it as a weakness. A lie. It’s important to understand this. Normal conservative Republicans still believe in a version of civic empathy. It’s not the same form that liberals embrace, because the conservative’s innate suspicion of too much change places limits on what kinds of policy responses they’ll support. But when George W. Bush visited that mosque after 9-11, at least he was embracing the premise that our democracy needs empathy, especially at the most challenging times.

We’re in a challenging time now—more so, I’d say, than after 9-11, because far more have died and we don’t know when this will end. And then, on top of the pandemic, comes the violence. And Trump’s response is to declare war on empathy. Oh, he talked a little bit about George Floyd, and he says, with all the feeling of a hostage reading a statement, that he is the ally of peaceful protesters. But his real message is unmistakable.

His real message is force. It was well summed up in the word “dominate,” which he used to the governors in that phone call Monday. “Dominate” is not an empathetic word, to put it mildly. It’s not even a democratic word. Democracies don’t dominate their own people; even lawless looters. No, “dominate” is a fascist word. Dominate is what an anti-democratic majority does to its minority, whether that minority is blacks, Jews, Muslims, Kulaks, Christians, intellectuals, whatever.

And it’s obvious that Trump is just itching to have an excuse to send some federal troops somewhere—preferably, in his fascist brain, to a place where there’s a Democratic mayor and a Democratic governor.

Trump may be the president. But he is not America. We have, thankfully, many other political leaders who are stepping forward who are America. Some of the governors, like Pritzker and Whitmer and Cuomo. Some Republican governors, too, like Hogan and DeWine and Baker. And some other Republicans have begun to pay more lip service to racial justice—Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham. Not enough of them, though—certainly not Scott Walker, who with that sick tweet Monday night showed that he was ready to try on a brown shirt for size. Bishop Mariann Budde of Washington, who spoke so powerfully about Trump appropriating a historic church for a photo op that he actually thought made him look strong but was the exact opposite, is America.

And Joe Biden, God bless him, is America, too. You don’t have to love him, fine. But if you watched that speech, you saw a patriot, and a person who really understands the importance of values like empathy and humility to the functioning of a democracy.

If I become president, I won’t get everything right, he said, “b ut I promise you this. I won’t traffic in fear and division.” Because “that’s what the presidency is. The duty to care. To care for all of us. Not just those who vote for us, but all of us.”

And finally, those folks on Facebook are America, too. And they’re the ones who matter most, because for all our problems, we are still enough of a democracy that what the people believe matters, and if enough people believe it’s time to deal with this horror of police violence against black citizens, we will, eventually, deal with it. It won’t be “solved,” but we will reach the point where defending it is unacceptable and where, finally, it is punished. We’ll reach a democratic consensus on behalf of civic empathy.

The president will exist outside that consensus. Alas, I’m sure some of those Facebook posters I saw will still be Trump voters. But some won’t be. Some will connect the dots between the physical violence we saw in Minneapolis and the rhetorical violence Trump suffocates us with every day. I believe with all my heart that a majority of Americans don’t want to be suffocated. We don’t want Donald Trump’s knee on our necks. We want to breathe."	left
ltyl8t	liberal	'It's Going to Be Like Myanmar.' Trump Cult Convinced Military Coup Will Put Him Back in Office	"CNN’s Donie O’Sullivan ventured out to California recently and spoke to QAnon believers who are convinced Trump will be back in the White House very soon as a result of a deadly military coup that they fully support.

“This whole thing with Biden… he’s like a puppet president. The military is in charge. It’s going to be like Myanmar… The military is doing their own investigation. And at the right time, they’re going to be restoring the republic with Trump as president,” one woman said.

O’Sullivan asked other attendees if they’d like to see Biden forcefully removed from office by the military, one man replied, “Absolutely.”

In Myanmar, one woman said, “The government took over and now they redoing the election.”

O’Sullivan then asked, “Would you like to see [a coup] happen?”

“I would like to see it,” one man replied.

Sounding stunned, O’Sullivan asked, “Really?”

“You know why? Because the election was stolen from us!” another woman answered.

These dangerous ideas are given credence by some Republicans who are currently in office. Just this week Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin echoed plenty of what was heard during the segment. Johnson lied during a Senate hearing that was examining what happened last month, claiming that the mob who attacked the Capitol on January 6th was full of “fake Trump protesters.”

And with the constant false accusations from the right about being canceled or censored combined with their drumbeat of lies about the so-called fake news media, it’s not a surprise that one woman claimed divine intervention because CNN spoke with her.

“I never would have believed CNN would have given me a chance to speak the truth,” she said. “What a miracle. Praise God.”"	left

The interview quickly turned hostile on Sunday as the two fought over reports of how many migrants have arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border since Biden became president compared to the biggest surges during Donald Trump’s presidency.

“Jeanine, just because you say my numbers are wrong, doesn’t mean they’re wrong,” Leopold argued, to which Pirro replied, “No. They’re facts. These are the facts.”

“They are not facts. Very few things I heard on this show tonight have been facts,” Leopold shot back.

Biden’s administration has been scrambling to handle a new surge of migrants after many anti-immigrant Trump policies were reversed, including one that mandated deportation of children seeking asylum, many of them attempting to escape violent gangs, pandemic-destroyed economies, and worsening climate disasters in Central America.

Republicans have heavily criticized Biden for the surge, blaming his decision to reverse Trump’s policies as the reason for the increase. But on Pirro’s show, Leopold accused the GOP of trying to use the migrant crisis to deflect public attention away from the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief plan passed by Democrats without a single Republican vote in Congress.

“President Biden kept his promise,” Leopold said. “He’s putting COVID relief out there. He’s making America better.”

He added, “He’s making America great again.”

The invocation of Trump’s famous slogan led Pirro to end the interview pronto.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Electoral College decisively confirmed Joe Biden on Monday as the nation’s next president, ratifying his November victory in an authoritative state-by-state repudiation of President Donald Trump’s refusal to concede he had lost.

The presidential electors gave Biden a solid majority of 306 electoral votes to Trump’s 232, the same margin that Trump bragged was a landslide when he won the White House four years ago.

Heightened security was in place in some states as electors met to cast paper ballots, with masks, social distancing and other pandemic precautions the order of the day. The results will be sent to Washington and tallied in a Jan. 6 joint session of Congress over which Vice President Mike Pence will preside.

For all Trump’s unsupported claims of fraud , there was little suspense and no change as every one of the electoral votes allocated to Biden and the president in last month’s popular vote went officially to each man. On Election Day, the Democrat topped the incumbent Republican by more than 7 million in the popular vote nationwide.

California’s 55 electoral votes put Biden over the top. Vermont, with 3 votes, was the first state to report. Hawaii, with 4 votes, was the last.

“Once again in America, the rule of law, our Constitution, and the will of the people have prevailed. Our democracy — pushed, tested, threatened — proved to be resilient, true, and strong,” Biden said in an evening speech in which he stressed the size of his win and the record 81 million people who voted for him.

He renewed his campaign promise to be a president for all Americans, whether they voted for him or not, and said the country has hard work ahead on the virus and economy.

But there was no concession from the White House, where Trump has continued to make unsupported allegations of fraud.

Trump remained in the Oval Office long after the sun set in Washington, calling allies and fellow Republicans while keeping track of the running Electoral College tally, according to White House and campaign aides. The president frequently ducked into the private dining room off the Oval Office to watch on TV, complaining that the cable networks were treating it like a mini-Election Night while not giving his challenges any airtime.

The president had grown increasingly disappointed with the size of “Stop the Steal” rallies across the nation as well as efforts for the GOP to field its own slates of electors in states. A presidential wish for a fierce administration defense led to TV appearances early Monday by Stephen Miller, one of his most ferocious advocates, to try to downplay the importance of the Electoral College vote and suggest that Trump’s legal challenges would continue all the way to Inauguration Day on Jan. 20.

Late in the day, he took to Twitter to announce that Attorney General William Barr was leaving the administration before Christmas. Barr’s departure comes amid lingering tension over Trump’s unsupported fraud claims, especially after Barr’s statement this month to The Associated Press that the election results were unaffected by any fraud.

In a Fox News interview taped over the weekend, Trump said that “I worry about the country having an illegitimate president, that’s what I worry about. A president that lost and lost badly.”

On Monday in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — the six battleground states that Biden won and Trump contested — electors gave Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris their votes in low-key proceedings. Nevada’s electors met via Zoom because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Trump’s efforts to undermine the election results also led to concerns about safety for the electors, virtually unheard of in previous years. In Michigan, lawmakers from both parties reported receiving threats, and legislative offices were closed over threats of violence. Biden won the state by 154,000 votes, or 2.8 percentage points, over Trump.

Georgia state police were out in force at the state Capitol in Atlanta before Democratic electors pledged to Biden met. There were no protesters seen.

Even with the Electoral College’s confirmation of Biden’s victory, some Republicans continued to refuse to acknowledge that reality. Yet their opposition to Biden had no practical effect on the electoral process, with the Democrat to be sworn in next month.

Republicans who would have been Trump electors met anyway in a handful of states Biden won. Pennsylvania Republicans said they cast a “procedural vote” for Trump and Pence in case courts that have repeatedly rejected challenges to Biden’s victory were to somehow still determine that Trump had won.

In North Carolina, Utah and other states across the country where Trump won, his electors turned out to duly cast their ballots for him. Electors in North Carolina had their temperatures checked before being allowed to enter the Capitol to vote. Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes withdrew as a Trump elector and was in quarantine because he was exposed to someone with COVID-19.

Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whom Trump defeated four years ago, were among New York’s 29 electors for Biden and Harris.

In New Hampshire, before the state’s four electors voted for Biden at the State House in Concord, 13-year-old Brayden Harrington led the group in the Pledge of Allegiance. He had delivered a moving speech at the Democratic National Convention in August about the struggle with stuttering he shares with Biden.

Following weeks of Republican legal challenges that were easily dismissed by judges, Trump and Republican allies tried to persuade the Supreme Court last week to set aside 62 electoral votes for Biden in four states, which might have thrown the outcome into doubt.

The justices rejected the effort on Friday.

The Electoral College was the product of compromise during the drafting of the Constitution between those who favored electing the president by popular vote and those who opposed giving the people the power to directly choose their leader.

Each state gets a number of electors equal to its total number of seats in Congress: two senators plus however many members the state has in the House of Representatives. Washington, D.C., has three votes, under a constitutional amendment that was ratified in 1961. With the exception of Maine and Nebraska, states award all their Electoral College votes to the winner of the popular vote in their state.

ldjugo	liberal	Republican Party has become ‘a cult’, says senior Democrat	"Representative Adam Schiff says that the Republican Party has become a “cult” due to its turn towards conspiracy theories and links with the “lunatic fringe”.

Speaking to Major Garrett, chief Washington correspondent for CBS News, the senior Democrat said that it was not just down to the influence of QAnon, but also “a whole range of conspiracy theories orbiting around Donald Trump.""

Mr Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, made the comments in conversation with Mr Garrett on the network’s podcast The Takeout.

“Sadly, it has already become essentially a cult, not just of QAnon, but a whole range of conspiracy theories orbiting around Donald Trump,” said the congressman.

“Which of course is a disaster not only for the Republican Party, but is a disaster for the country. We really rely on two functional parties for our system to work, and right now we don't have that,” he added.

In a damning assessment of the state of the minority party in Congress, Mr Schiff says that Republicans were “entwined” in the falsehoods and conspiracy theories spread by the former president.

“Until they're able to extricate themselves from this lunatic fringe, until they're able to extricate themselves also from the person of Donald Trump, there's not much hope for that party, tragically,” he said.

Mr Schiff made the comments as the House prepared to vote on Thursday to strip committee assignments from Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, the most prominent proponent of wild QAnon-focussed conspiracy theories.

Ms Greene was removed from the committees on which she sat by that vote which saw just eleven GOP representatives in favour of the action.

Mr Schiff slammed Republican leadership for not removing her ahead of a floor vote. He said that having someone on an education committee who had previously denied school shootings took place, made “a mockery of the Congress”.

Ms Green said in a speech on Thursday that comments she had made in videos and on social media posts, including 9/11 denial and being in favour of executing senior Democrats, were “words of the past … [that] do not represent my values”.

Mr Schiff’s comments also come ahead of the second Senate impeachment trial of Mr Trump, which begins on 9 February.

The former president faces one article of impeachment — incitement of insurrection — after falsely claiming to have won the 2020 election by a landslide and encouraging a rally of his supporters to march to the US Capitol and confront lawmakers.

Five people died in the subsequent violent assault on Congress by pro-Trump rioters on 6 January.

In the article of impeachment, House Democrats state that Mr Trump’s actions “foreseeably resulted in lawless action at the Capitol”.

Only ten Republican representatives voted in favour of impeachment and only five GOP senators voted to proceed with the trial in the upper chamber.

Mr Schiff’s prominent role in the Russia investigation and first impeachment of Mr Trump made him a favourite target of the president on social media and during press conferences and at rallies."	left
iyf7xw	liberal	Trump is Trashing The Constitution to Stay in Power	"Before there was a United States of America, there was a postal system. Revolutionaries like Samuel Adams and Thomas Jefferson hatched their plans using underground postal networks known as committees of correspondence. In 1775, a year before the Declaration of Independence, the Continental Congress created the Post Office Department and named Benjamin Franklin the first postmaster general.

American democracy expanded with the postal system, one of the only institutions that bound the new nation together and aimed to serve the many rather than the few. The Post Office Act of 1792, signed by George Washington, heavily subsidized the mailing of newspapers, laying the groundwork for an informed citizenry. It also made it a crime for the government to interfere with the mail. When the French philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville visited the United States in the 1830s, he marveled at the young country’s postal system—it had twice as many post offices as Great Britain and five times as many as France. The United States’ progressive ideals traveled with the mail. Abolitionists sent anti-slavery publications to the South before the Civil War. The postal system employed women before they had the right to vote, and hired 243 Black postmasters during the 19th century. Ten of the pallbearers at Frederick Douglass’ funeral were mail carriers.

There’s a reason why the United States Postal Service remains the most popular government institution, with a 91 percent approval rating. At a time of widening inequality, it costs the same amount to mail a domestic letter no matter where you live. Even in the digital age, the mail remains essential for businesses to serve customers, for seniors and veterans to receive medicine, and for Americans of all stripes to get pandemic supplies like masks—and cast their ballots. Winifred Gallagher, author of How the Post Office Created America, calls it “the central nervous system of American democracy.”

The post office has often been politicized; presidents, most notoriously Andrew Jackson, appointed loyalists as postmaster general and rewarded supporters with postal jobs. But no president before Donald Trump has ever sought to sabotage the institution’s workings to win reelection. Nor has any president installed a postmaster general like Louis DeJoy, the Republican megadonor who in record time instituted a dizzying array of changes—eliminating overtime, displacing 23 top executives, reducing post office hours—that seem designed to further the GOP’s long-term goal of privatizing the post office and its short-term goal of suppressing mail-in votes cast by Democrats. (Following public outcry, he agreed to suspend some of the changes until after the election. A federal judge later blocked other changes, calling them “an intentional effort on the part of the current Administration to disrupt and challenge the legitimacy of upcoming local, state, and federal elections.”)

Earlier this year, before DeJoy took over, the USPS delivered 590 million pieces of mail to households across the country for the 2020 census, the largest first-class mailing in its history. The census sets the course for the next decade of American democracy: It determines how $1.5 trillion in federal funding is allocated, how many congressional seats and Electoral College votes states receive, and how state and federal legislative districts are drawn.

Like the USPS, the census has been around since the country’s founding. Barely 100 words into its first article, the Constitution calls for an “enumeration” of the “whole number of free persons” every 10 years. (Native Americans were excluded from the census until 1860, and Black Americans were counted as three-fifths of a person until the 14th Amendment declared that the “whole number of persons in each state” must be counted.) And like the post office, the census is in unprecedented danger from an administration determined to ignore the Constitution to preserve its own power.

Whom the census counts and doesn’t count has always been politically charged. After the 1920 tally revealed that the majority of Americans lived in cities, the rural-dominated House of Representatives refused to use census data for congressional reapportionment for the first and only time in US history. Instead, Congress passed sweeping curbs on immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe to preserve rural white Protestant power. Throughout its history, the Census Bureau has failed to accurately count communities of color. The 2010 census was the most accurate yet, but it still overcounted white people while missing millions of Latinos, Black people, and Native Americans.

Until now, however, no administration has sought to manipulate the census to deliberately distort the results. In 2018, the Trump administration announced that it would add a question to the census about citizenship status, a move that seemed certain to depress immigrant participation until the Supreme Court struck it down last year. Undeterred, the administration said it would not count undocumented immigrants for congressional apportionment, a move constitutional experts called a violation of the 14th Amendment.

The administration’s efforts to undermine the census have repeatedly been thwarted in court. In September, federal judges temporarily restored the full enumeration period and blocked Trump’s scheme to exclude undocumented immigrants from congressional apportionment. But the damage may have already been done. Experts are warning that the census data could be so skewed that Congress chooses to reject it, like it did in 1920—this time not for sinister reasons, but for the good of the country. “I’m really concerned there might be some really serious errors with the census,” says John Thompson, who directed the Census Bureau from 2013 to 2017. “It’s definitely a possibility. It could be seriously flawed.”In early August, as the Census Bureau was finally dispatching workers to knock on doors in hard-to-count areas after months of delay due to COVID-19, the administration announced that it was cutting census operations short by a month. That gave enumerators less than eight weeks to track down the 40 percent of households that had not yet filled out the census form—disproportionately in communities of color.

Trump defended his move to exclude undocumented immigrants from congressional apportionment by claiming that it “reflects a better understanding of the Constitution.” What the administration’s actions really reflect is an emphatic repudiation of the Constitution. The census and the Postal Service are two of the essential domestic governmental operations specifically mentioned in the founding document. Over the past decade, Republicans have passed laws making it more difficult to vote, but Trump’s war on the USPS and the Census Bureau represents a dramatic escalation of his party’s anti-­democratic agenda; rather than pursuing disenfranchisement of people of color and Democrats within the bounds of the Constitution, he’s seeking to eviscerate those limits. He is working to transform long-standing nonpartisan institutions into explicitly partisan ones, shifting their essential mission from serving all Americans to furthering only the interests of a shrinking minority: white conservatives.

The extraordinary efforts to undermine the mail and census should prepare us for the possibility of an even more egregious abuse of power to keep Trump in office.

Trump’s effort to corrupt core institutions for the benefit of his ruling clique bears an eerie resemblance to the slide toward authoritarianism in other countries. “The practice of taking highly legitimate, effective institutions of the state and politicizing and using them for short-term political advantage is page one of the authoritarian playbook,” says Steven Levitsky, a professor of government at Harvard and co-­author of How Democracies Die.

By eroding Americans’ confidence in the census, the administration may already be accomplishing its goal of rigging the count in its favor. “The most disastrous thing for the census is that people sit it out because they don’t trust the administration,” says Vanita Gupta, who led the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division under Barack Obama and is now president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. The same thing could happen with the post office: If voters are afraid to vote in person yet believe that postal delays will cause their mail-in ballots not to be counted, they may decide not to vote at all. (More than 550,000 mail-in ballots were rejected during this year’s primaries, a huge increase from 2016.)

During a testy congressional hearing in August, DeJoy promised, “I am not engaged in sabotaging the election.” The same day, Trump delivered an ominous speech at the Republican National Convention in which he accused Democrats of “using covid to steal an election” by expanding mail-in voting and said, “The only way they can take this election away from us is if this is a rigged election.”

If the census and Postal Service are central functions of the Constitution, free and fair elections and the peaceful transfer of power are the bedrock principles that define it. Trump has already signaled he may not abide by either. The extraordinary efforts to undermine the mail and census should prepare us for the possibility of an even more egregious abuse of power to keep Trump in office. “A lot of this is laying the groundwork for calling into question the legitimacy of the election in November,” Gupta says.

It’s not difficult to imagine an Election Day scenario in which Trump prematurely declares victory based on his lead among in-person votes, which are quicker to tally than mail-in votes in many states and are expected to lean more Republican. Trump then seeks to invalidate the mail-in ballots that favor Democrats before they’re counted. Republican-controlled legislatures in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin intervene on his behalf. In a Bush v. Gore redux, the Supreme Court’s conservative majority cuts the count short or invalidates enough votes to install Trump for a second term.

If that happens, the question won’t be whether American democracy can survive Trump. We’ll already know that it hasn’t.

“From the frontlines of our own Revolution to Belleau Wood to the Normandy beaches to the mountains of Afghanistan, the sacrifice and bravery of our troops and their willingness to serve our nation should be honored,” Biden wrote.

“Duty, honor, country — those are the values that drive our service members. Those are the values that have formed the core of America’s defense for centuries,” he added.

Biden concluded by pledging to “ensure that our American heroes know that I will have their back and honor their sacrifice” should he become the next commander in chief.

His statement comes after a report from The Atlantic, citing anonymous sources, described Trump allegedly denigrating U.S. service members.

Before a planned visit to honor the American dead at a French cemetery just outside Paris in 2018, Trump reportedly called the U.S. service members buried there during World War I as “losers.”

Trump ultimately canceled the visit to the cemetery at the last minute, stating that due to the rain, the helicopter could not fly to the location, noting that the Secret Service could not drive him.

However, according to four sources with knowledge of the incident, Trump was reluctant to travel to the cemetery because he was concerned that the rain would dishevel his hair, The Atlantic reported.

In another conversation, Trump reportedly said that the 1,800 Marines who lost their lives in the battle of Belleau Wood were “suckers” for getting killed. The president reportedly asked aides about historic details about WWI, including “Who were the good guys in this war?”

This is not the first time Trump has made controversial comments about veterans.

Trump previously mocked the late Sen. John McCain John Sidney McCainBudowsky: Liz Cheney vs. conservatives in name only Cheney slams Trump on 'big lie' over election Exclusive — Cruz, Rubio ramp up criticisms of big business MORE (R-Ariz.), a Vietnam veteran who was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam, and said he wasn’t a war hero “because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.”

The Atlantic also reported that Trump told senior staff he wouldn’t support McCain’s funeral and grew angry when he saw flags at the White House lowered to half-staff to recognize the senator.

Trump vehemently denied The Atlantic’s reporting, angrily calling it “fake news” and a “disgrace” and suggesting the author and his sources are “liars.”

""If they really exist, if people really exist that would have said that, they’re low lifes and they’re liars. And I would be willing to swear on anything that I never said that about our fallen heroes. There is nobody that respects them more,” Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews after a campaign stop in Pennsylvania Thursday evening.

“So, I just think it's a horrible, horrible thing. It made a great evening into frankly a very sad evening when I see a statement like that. No animal, nobody, what animal would say such a thing?” Trump continued.

On Twitter, he insisted that while he disagreed with McCain on policy issues, he approved the lowering of the flag to half-staff and the use of an Air Force plane to transport McCain’s casket from Arizona.

Trump also denied ever calling McCain a loser, saying that he would “swear on whatever, or whoever, I was asked to swear on, that I never called our great fallen soldiers anything other than HEROES.”

Many social media users resurfaced Trump’s remarks in 2015 where he made the disparaging comments about McCain and said he doesn’t “like losers.”

They also noted that Trump shared a link to an article about his remarks with the headline “Donald Trump: John McCain Is ‘A Loser.’ ”

lowbvr	liberal	AG nominee Garland vows to restore DOJ independence; casts domestic extremist battle as 'central' to mission	"AG nominee Garland vows to restore DOJ independence; casts domestic extremist battle as 'central' to mission

Show Caption Hide Caption Judge Merrick Garland up for attorney general confirmation Merrick Garland, Biden's attorney general pick, has a long history with the Justice Department. Here are three things to know about Judge Garland. USA TODAY

Attorney general nominee Merrick Garland is vowing to defend the Justice Department's independence from the White House, pursue equal justice for communities of color and make the battle against extremism ""central"" to the department's mission, according to remarks prepared for delivery Monday at his Senate confirmation hearing.

Garland, a former top Justice official who last served during the Clinton administration, said he would reaffirm policies that he described as the foundation of the agency, including standards that ""protect the independence of the department from partisan influence in law enforcement investigations; that strictly regulate communications with the White House.""

Acknowledging the public outrage that defined last summer's social justice protests, Garland highlighted the mission of the department's Civil Rights Division to protect the rights of the ""most vulnerable members of our society.""

""That mission remains urgent because we do not yet have equal justice,"" Garland's statement said. ""Communities of color and other minorities still face discrimination in housing, education, employment, and the criminal justice system; and bear the brunt of the harm caused by pandemic, pollution, and climate change.""

Referring to last month's Capitol attack, Garland recalled his past supervision of the Oklahoma City bombing investigation and the prosecution of bomber Timothy McVeigh and conspirator Terry Nichols who sought to ""spark a revolution that would topple the federal government.""

""I will supervise the prosecution of white supremacists and others who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 — a heinous attack that sought to disrupt a cornerstone of our democracy: the peaceful transfer of power to a newly elected government,"" the judge said.

The selection of Garland has been cast by Biden as an attempt to reset a Justice Department roiled by politics and efforts by former President Donald Trump to use the institution to advance his political interests.

Garland got a boost Friday when four former attorneys general, including two Republicans, were among bipartisan groups of Justice Department alums and former federal judges who announced for the nominee.

Michael Mukasey and Alberto Gonzales, who both served as attorneys general in the George W. Bush administration, were among more than 150 former Justice officials and U.S. attorneys who lauded the federal appeals court judge as ""the right person"" for a difficult job following the tumult of the Trump administration.

Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch, who led the Justice Department during the Obama administration, also were among the signatories to a letter submitted to the leadership of the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Garland is set for a Monday confirmation hearing.

DOJ: The Justice Department urgently needs a reset. Enter Merrick Garland. Is he up for it?

A separate endorsement was submitted on behalf of 61 former federal judges appointed by Republican and Democratic presidents.

""Judge Garland approaches the law with an unwavering commitment to fairness and justice,"" the judges said. ""Those of us who have worked directly with Judge Garland have seen firsthand his strong moral compass and abiding integrity.""

""The work and reputation of the Department of Justice are as important as they have ever been,"" the former Justice officials said. ""Judge Garland is the right person to ensure the fair administration of justice, whether related to national security, public integrity, civil rights, antitrust, crime, or other pressing issues.

""He is also the right person to do so with integrity, humility, and a complete understanding of the substantial responsibility on his shoulders at this time,"" the former Justice officials said.

mmg921	liberal	The federal lawsuit against Donald Trump saying he conspired with the January 6th insurrection keeps growing	"The federal lawsuit that alleges Donald Trump, his lawyer, and far-right extremists at the U.S. Capitol conspired to interfere in the counting of Electoral College votes in favor of now-President Joe Biden got even bigger this week.

The suit was brought early this year by lawyers for the NAACP on behalf of Rep. Bennie Thompson. The lawyers amended their complaint on Wednesday to add 10 new plaintiffs.

The additional plaintiffs will include other members of Congress, and the amended complaint includes additional information about the deadly riot that took place on January 6. Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr, and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani are accused of inciting the riot.

Thompson’s suit accuses Trump of violating the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which makes it a federal crime to “conspire to prevent, by force, intimidation, or threat” officials from holding office or carrying out their official duties.

In the lawsuit, Thompson named the far-right groups the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys as defendants and co-conspirators alongside Trump.

Trump has lawyered up hiring Jesse Binnall. Binnall also represented former National Security Adviser Gen. Mike Flynn.

The expansion of the lawsuit comes as Trump’s other legal issues mount.

Back in March, James Blassingame and James Hemby, two Capitol Police officers filed a federal lawsuit against Trump over injuries they received protecting the Capitol on January 6. Both officers are veterans of the force. In their suit, they allege that Trump “inflamed, encouraged, incited, directed, and aided and abetted” the “insurrectionist mob” that attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6 and caused both men’s injuries.

Blassingame claims in the lawsuit that he suffered head and back injuries and is dealing with depression linked to the attack. Hemby claims that he is under the care of an orthopedist for injuries to his head and back by rioters and that he will need long-term physical therapy.

In the lawsuit, Blassingame says that he “is haunted by the memory of being attacked, and of the sensory impacts — the sights, sounds, smells and even tastes of the attack remain close to the surface,” according to the complaint. “He experiences guilt of being unable to help his colleagues who were simultaneously being attacked, and of surviving were other colleagues did not.”

In the 40-page lawsuit officers, Blassingame and Hemby describe a severe physical and emotional toll from the riot that still haunts them. They also claim that Trump bears direct responsibility for unleashing violent followers upon the Capitol. Both Blassingame and Hemby are seeking unspecified compensation and damages greater than $75,000 apiece.

The officer’s lawsuit relies greatly on Trump’s own words to rioters that he made in a rally just before the pro-Trump mob marched to the Capitol. Trump has already been impeached by the House for a second time for inciting rioters at the rally.

In the lawsuit, Blassingame shares that he was slammed into a stone column while rioters hurled the N-word at him. Hemby says that he suffered hand and knee injuries that require continued medical care. Both officers stated that they suffer from the ongoing emotional trauma that has upended their lives.

The officers’ description of the mob is in stark contrast to the way that Trump describes the moment. Trump continues to claim that it was a peaceful protest, where his supporters posed “zero threat” and were “hugging and kissing” police.

Trump has not publicly addressed the officer’s lawsuit and it is not known who will represent him in the case.

Trump also faces a lawsuit from Rep. Eric Swalwell. Swalwell has accused Trump his son Donald Trump Jr, and Rep. Mo Brooks of engaging in “a conspiracy against civil rights” by allegedly inciting the riot on January 6.

These suits are just two of a growing list of criminal investigations and lawsuits that Trump, his family, and the Trump Organization are facing.

Reportedly, Trump has privately complained that his enemies are going to be “suing me for the rest of my life.”"	left
mhw8mf	liberal	Nearly 7 million uninsured Americans qualify for free health insurance	"After the passage of President Joe Biden’s first Covid-19 relief plan, nearly 7 million uninsured Americans now qualify for free health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, according to new federal projections shared exclusively with Vox.

The American Rescue Plan (ARP), which takes effect on Thursday, expanded eligibility for the Affordable Care Act’s premium subsidies — federal aid to help people pay for insurance plans bought on the individual marketplace. It also made the subsidies more generous for the people who already qualify for them. It expanded the number of people currently without any insurance coverage who could enroll in a plan for free.

Roughly 29 million people currently living in the US lack health insurance. According to the new HHS estimates, at least 6.8 million of them could now purchase an ACA plan with no monthly premium, and another 1.3 million could sign up for a health plan that costs less than $50 a month. Many of those people already qualified for free or low-cost coverage prior to the ARP, but based on the federal projections, the new law’s expansion of the ACA made an additional 2 million Americans eligible for free or cheap coverage.

Sign up for The Weeds newsletter Vox’s German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration’s unprecedented burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday.

A low premium is no guarantee that a plan’s out-of-pocket costs will also be low enough for people to find it affordable. But about 1.9 million people with incomes between 100 and 150 percent of the poverty level can get insurance with no monthly premium that will cover 94 percent of their medical costs, according to federal estimates. And about two-thirds of uninsured Black and Hispanic/Latinx Americans, who are less likely to have coverage than their white peers, qualify for zero-cost coverage.

“President Biden promised to bring down health care costs, and by implementing the American Rescue Plan, this administration is delivering,” HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement. “People deserve the peace of mind that comes from knowing you can take care of your health without going into debt.”

The challenge will be in enrolling those people. It’s been a longstanding problem that many uninsured Americans already qualify for assistance but haven’t signed up.

The Biden administration is giving itself a big window to reach them. Enrollment will be open on HealthCare.gov and most state insurance marketplaces until August 15. HHS is doubling its new advertising campaign to support open enrollment, from $50 million to $100 million. It is contacting people who have previously started the enrollment process but for whatever reason never finished it and engaging with community groups to contact the uninsured.

The US isn’t going to reach full universal coverage without another bill more ambitious than the American Rescue Plan. But that legislation, and its promise of free health insurance for millions, could go a long way toward bringing down the uninsured rate in the near term — if people hear the message.

Joe Biden is stretching Obamacare as far as it can go

The Affordable Care Act is now, arguably for the first time, fully operational.

The American Rescue Plan made 3.7 million more people eligible for the health care law’s premium subsidies. The Biden administration already opened up enrollment after taking office, and 200,000 Americans signed up in the first two weeks. The administration has since extended enrollment until August 15, backed by millions of dollars in advertising.

Insurers are expanding into new markets. The individual mandate is gone, but, as it turns out, it may not be as important to the law’s long-term viability as originally thought. This is a new beginning of sorts.

“The ACA is right now much closer to what its advocates hoped it would be from the start,” Larry Levitt, executive vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), told me earlier this week. “This is a true test of how effective a juiced-up ACA can be at getting us closer to universal coverage.

Taken together, come Labor Day, the country should have the clearest idea yet of how the ACA functions at full strength — and where holes in the US health system remain.

A big contributor is Biden’s ARP, which eliminated the cap on eligibility for premium subsidies. Before the ARP, people making more than 400 percent of the federal poverty level (about $51,500 for an individual or $106,000 for a family of four) could not receive federal assistance. The new law has lifted that cap so that nobody will pay more than 8.5 percent of their income toward their health insurance.

The Kaiser Family Foundation released new estimates of how the law would affect health coverage and found that change will make an especially big difference for the people who were making just a little too much money to qualify, those in the 400–600 percent range. About 2.4 million people in that income bracket will be eligible for subsidies. A lot of people making more money than that may already be paying 8.5 percent of their income or less for insurance, no matter how expensive it is, but another 1 million or so people with those higher incomes will now qualify for assistance too.

In chart form, the difference between the pre- and post-ARP versions of the ACA is best represented by the green bars on the right. Those are the newly eligible people.

Not only does the American Rescue Plan make more people eligible, the law also increased the size of the subsidies that people receive. The light-blue bar in the chart below illustrates how much the new subsidy will contribute to a person’s premiums. For the Americans who make less than 150 percent of the poverty level, the federal government is covering a $500 monthly bill for their health insurance.

So millions of people are newly eligible for subsidies and millions more now qualify for more generous subsidies. In fact, according to Kaiser’s estimates, a majority of the 29 million uninsured people in the US already qualify for either ACA subsidies or Medicaid.

But, obviously, they haven’t signed up. This has actually been a longstanding problem: Millions of people are eligible for health care assistance but, for whatever reason, they don’t take advantage of it. (Surveys suggest a lot of these folks don’t know they qualify for help.)

This is where Biden’s extended enrollment period and advertising blitz come in. Shortly after taking office, Biden announced a special ACA enrollment period from February 15 to May 15. Then last week, the administration said they would extend that enrollment period until August 15. That gives them five months to try to reach as many of those 29 million as they can.

The Biden administration is giving itself a lot of time and money to try to cover more Americans. This might also be the best avenue to expanding coverage during Biden’s presidency if a public option can’t pass the Senate. (They’d also need to make the new ARP subsidies, currently set to expire in two years, permanent at some point.)

It won’t be easy. The remaining uninsured are uninsured for a reason: They are generally less tied to the institutions and communities that might connect them to health coverage.

But the renewed optimism around the ACA is real. Look no further than the health insurers themselves. Cigna is reportedly planning next year to double the number of markets where it’s selling ACA plans. It makes sense: The ACA market is now almost as profitable for health insurers as the high-margin Medicare Advantage market.

Some uninsured people won’t be covered anytime soon. Democrats tried to entice more states to expand Medicaid through ARPA and, while it appears Republicans in Alabama and Wyoming may be receptive to their offer, the biggest non-expansion states do not appear to be swayed. Two million or so Americans living in poverty will remain without coverage. The nearly 4 million people currently ineligible for assistance because of their citizenship status also won’t be helped by the ARP or Biden’s advertising campaign.

The US health system will still be in need of repairs this fall. But in the meantime, Biden is giving a newly improved version of Obamacare a chance to stretch itself as far as it can go."	left
jvyue4	liberal	Election Security Experts Slap Down Baseless Claims of Voter Fraud	"Following up last week's powerful joint statement from the NASED, NASS, CISA, EAC, and other groups deeply involved in election administration, another impressive collection of People Who Know What They're Talking About - this time the nation's top computer scientists and election security experts - joined the fray on Monday via an open letter to the nation.





We are pleased to share the full text of the letter here.









Scientists say no credible evidence of computer fraud in the 2020 election outcome, but policymakers must work with experts to improve confidence





16 November 2020





We are specialists in election security, having studied the security of voting machines, voting systems, and technology used for government elections for decades.





We and other scientists have warned for many years that there are security weaknesses in voting systems and have advocated that election systems be better secured against malicious attack. As the National Academies recently concluded, “There is no realistic mechanism to fully secure vote casting and tabulation computer systems from cyber threats.” However, notwithstanding these serious concerns, we have never claimed that technical vulnerabilities have actually been exploited to alter the outcome of any US election.





Anyone asserting that a US election was “rigged” is making an extraordinary claim, one that must be supported by persuasive and verifiable evidence. Merely citing the existence of technical flaws does not establish that an attack occurred, much less that it altered an election outcome. It is simply speculation.





The presence of security weaknesses in election infrastructure does not by itself tell us that any election has actually been compromised. Technical, physical, and procedural safeguards complicate the task of maliciously exploiting election systems, as does monitoring of likely adversaries by law enforcement and the intelligence community. Altering an election outcome involves more than simply the existence of a technical vulnerability.





We are aware of alarming assertions being made that the 2020 election was “rigged” by exploiting technical vulnerabilities. However, in every case of which we are aware, these claims either have been unsubstantiated or are technically incoherent. To our collective knowledge, no credible evidence has been put forth that supports a conclusion that the 2020 election outcome in any state has been altered through technical compromise.





That said, it is imperative that the US continue working to bolster the security of elections against sophisticated adversaries. At a minimum, all states should employ election security practices and mechanisms recommended by experts to increase assurance in election outcomes, such as post-election risk-limiting audits.





If you are looking for a good place to start learning the facts about election security, we recommend the recent National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) study, “Securing the Vote”, which is available for free download at https://doi.org/10.17226/25120.

Show Caption Hide Caption Prosecutors release videos from alleged kidnapping plot against Gov. Gretchen Whitmer Some of the photos and videos were taken by a confidential FBI informant who was accepted as a member of the anti-government group and show weapons and rapid-fire training. U.S. Attorney's Office

LANSING — Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer accused President Donald Trump of inciting domestic terrorism during a national TV appearance Sunday, in her strongest criticism of Trump to date.

""It's incredibly disturbing that the president of the United States, 10 days after a plot to kidnap, put me on trial, and execute me — 10 days after that was uncovered — the president is at it again and inspiring and incentivizing and inciting this kind of domestic terrorism,"" Whitmer said on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" following a Trump campaign appearance in Michigan Saturday.

""It is dangerous, not just for me and my family, but for public servants everywhere,"" said Whitmer, calling on opinion leaders everywhere to ""call this out"" and demand Trump tamp down his remarks.

On Saturday night, Trump held a campaign rally at an airport near Muskegon, where he again repeated criticism of Whitmer for measures she has taken to address the coronavirus pandemic, prompting chants of ""Lock her Up,"" and appeared to summarize the alleged plot against Whitmer with the words: ""I guess they say she was threatened.""

Trump has said Whitmer should be appreciative because federal officials uncovered and foiled the plot. In response to the chant from the crowd, Trump laughed and said: ""Lock them all up.""

Trump and his surrogates pushed back at Whitmer Sunday, with Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, saying on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that the president was only ""having fun"" at the Michigan rally, and Trump's campaign accusing Whitmer on Twitter of encouraging Trump's assassination.

Federal and state officials have charged 14 men in connection with alleged domestic terror plots that included a plan to kidnap Whitmer from her family's vacation home in northern Michigan. Defendants in the case conducted surveillance of the home on two occasions and discussed abducting her by boat and taking her to Wisconsin to ""stand trial"" for treason, according to evidence in the case.

Whitmer has said Trump is ""complicit"" in the plot by using highly charged words to criticize her, by sometimes refusing to condemn right-wing groups, and by giving encouragement and legitimacy to such groups by tweeting comments such as, ""Liberate Michigan,"" and by urging Whitmer to meet and negotiate with Capitol demonstrators.

In Sunday's remarks, Whitmer, a national co-chair of former Vice President Joe Biden's Democratic campaign for president, took those earlier comments a step further, by saying Trump actually incites terrorism.

Michigan, which Trump won by fewer than 11,000 votes in 2016 after it had been won by the Democratic presidential candidates in each election since 1988, has emerged as a crucial state to both campaigns in the Nov. 3 election.

Lara Trump, an adviser to the Trump campaign, said on CNN that Trump ""wasn't doing anything, I don't think, to provoke people to threaten this woman at all,"" but was merely ""having fun at a Trump rally.""

Trump's campaign said on Twitter that Whitmer, who displayed a small ""8645"" button, beside a potted plant in the background of her TV appearance, was ""encouraging assassination attempts against President Trump."" Some Democrats have promoted 8645 logos and T-shirts as part of their messaging to defeat Trump, the 45th president, and remove him from the White House. To ""86"" someone most commonly means to have them removed from a service establishment, such as a bar or restaurant. Trump campaign spokesman Chris Gustafson said that 86 ""can be shorthand for killing someone.""

Whitmer also said that with coronavirus cases rising nationally and in Michigan, all of the progress Michigan has made against the pandemic is ""at risk"" due to what she denounced as a ""partisan"" 4-3 Michigan Supreme Court decision Oct. 2 that struck down as unconstitutional the Emergency Powers of Governor Act of 1945.

That statute was the major legal underpinning for Michigan's state of emergency and Whitmer's emergency orders related to the pandemic after courts ruled earlier Whitmer cannot extend a state of emergency beyond 28 days without approval of the Legislature, which the GOP-controlled House and Senate have refused to provide.

Whitmer said the Supreme Court decision ""has created a lot of confusion and has worked to undermine the work we have done here."" But she said she is using the Michigan Public Health code and other powers to continue a statewide mask mandate, restrict the size of indoor and outdoor gatherings and set requirements to ensure workplace safety.

Trump told thousands gathered at his Saturday rally they need to get Whitmer to end Michigan's lockdown. Whitmer lifted Michigan's stay-at-home order June 1, though some restrictions on business and other activities remain in place.

""We haven't had a stay-home order since late spring,"" Whitmer said Sunday, but Trump ""never lets facts get in the way of comments he is making.""

She said Trump's response to the pandemic is ""the worst in the globe,"" and that is because he has politicized the crisis, rather than addressing it from a science and health perspective.

We should have acted as though we were in a war,"" Whitmer said. ""But not a war with one another, a war with a virus.""

Laura Cox, chair of the Michigan Republican Party, repeated on Twitter the Trump campaign's allegation about the 8645 button and said Whitmer was resorting to ""partisan games"" during her TV appearance, ""to deflect from her failures on COVID-19 and as Joe Biden’s national co-chair.""

It was Whitmer's third appearance on ""Meet the Press,"" the most influential of the Sunday public affairs programs and the longest-running program in TV history. She earlier appeared on the program in March and April, during the height of the coronavirus pandemic.

iziu9g	liberal	You Really Believe That?’: Anderson Cooper Stunned When Tom Friedman Predicts America on the Brink of ‘Potential Second Civil War’	"CNN’s Anderson Cooper was stunned when New York Times columnist Tom Friedman predicted that the country was on the brink of a “potential second civil war” during an appearance on AC360.

Cooper introduced his Thursday night segment with Friedman to discuss President Donald Trump‘s recent comments, in which he would not commit to the peaceful transfer of power after the election.

Friedman called Trump’s comments “stunning and surprising,” and added: “You know, I began my career as a journalist covering Lebanon’s second civil war in its history, and I’m terrified to find myself ending my career as a journalist covering America’s potential second civil war in its history.”

“You really believe that?” asked an astonished Cooper.

“I think what happened in the last few days is a six-alarm fire,” said Friedman, adding that he thought the danger rose to a level of “DEFCON 5,” an apparent error referring to the U.S. military’s “defense readiness condition” classification system, in which DEFCON 5 is the lowest, normal state of readiness and DEFCON 1 is an imminent or current nuclear war.

“The President of the United States has told us ‘Either I win the election or I delegitimize the election.’ Those are your choices, folks.”

Friedman continued, accusing Trump of trying to “trying to break people’s will — he’s trying to get people to say, ‘What the heck, he wants it so bad, just give it to him.'”

Friedman also called the situation “terrifying” and “the most frightening moment in my life,” because Trump is “backed by a state-owned network,” an apparent reference to Fox News, and “because the Republican Party has become basically a political brothel that rents itself out by the night to whoever will energize its base.”

“This is a party that went into its convention with no platform, just basically said whatever Trump wants, we want,” Friedman pointed out. “And I — if you’re not frightened now, if you are not terrified for what could happen, it’s not ‘We might have a disputed election.’ It is ‘We are going to have a disputed election, almost certainly,’ unless Trump wins, in which case I shudder to think what four more years of this would be like.”

Friedman continued his excoriation of the GOP: “When you have a president without shame, backed by a party without spine, amplified by a network without integrity, and by social networks that are marinated in conspiracy theories, behind whom are a lot of armed people — if you are not frightened by this, you are not paying attention.”

“So what do you do?” Cooper asked.

“There is only one thing to do,” Friedman concluded. “Vote. Go out and vote. Vote for Joe Biden…There is only one tool we have. It is a tool that can work. That is to overwhelmingly vote. I have written and I will repeat: I will walk to the polls. I will crawl to the polls. I will slither to the polls, bike to the polls, hike to the polls, but I will cast my vote for Joe Biden.”

In an unsigned order without noted dissent, the justices declined to take up Trump’s lawsuit alleging Wisconsin election officials violated the Constitution by expanding absentee voting amid the global coronavirus pandemic.

Trump sued in Wisconsin more than a month after Biden won the state by just over 20,000 votes.

His lawsuit claimed that policies put in place by the Wisconsin Election Commission to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus — like establishing absentee ballot drop boxes — illegally usurped the state legislature’s sole power over election rules.

When he filed the suit in late December, Trump had asked the court to fast-track a review of his case ahead of the Jan. 6 meeting of Congress to certify the results, a request the justices denied.

That joint congressional session was later interrupted when a violent pro-Trump mob breached the Capitol. Trump's comments to the mob just prior to the riot fueled his second impeachment in the House. He was later acquitted in the Senate.

The court’s denial of Trump’s appeal on Monday means that fewer than four justices agreed to hear his case.

Several of the court’s more conservative justices had previously indicated an interest in addressing questions over what the Constitution says about how election authority is allocated within states.

As is typical practice, however, the justices did not provide the public on Monday with a full view of how they voted on the petition or their reasoning.

Some legal scholars believe that the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol dissuaded the court from taking up disputes related to the 2020 election over concerns that it could fuel false claims promoted by Trump and his allies that the election results were illegitimate.

lc1vnu	liberal	Hundreds of congressional staffers sign letter to senators urging them to convict Trump	"(CNN) Hundreds of congressional staffers wrote an open letter to senators urging them to consider the trauma aides experienced during the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol and to convict former President Donald Trump ""for our sake, and the sake of the country.""

""We are staff who work for members of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives, where it is our honor and privilege to serve our country and our fellow Americans. We write this letter to share our own views and experiences, not the views of our employers. But on January 6, 2021, our workplace was attacked by a violent mob trying to stop the electoral college vote count. That mob was incited by former president Donald J. Trump and his political allies, some of whom we pass every day in the hallways at work,"" more than 370 staffers, who are predominantly Democrats, wrote in the letter released Wednesday.

Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives before he left office in January for inciting the insurrection at the Capitol, which forced lawmakers and staffers alike to evacuate their offices. Arguments in the Senate trial are set to begin next week, and House impeachment managers will argue that Trump is 'singularly responsible' for the riot, according to a brief they filed Tuesday.

""As Congressional employees, we don't have a vote on whether to convict Donald J. Trump for his role in inciting the violent attack at the Capitol, but our Senators do. And for our sake, and the sake of the country, we ask that they vote to convict the former president and bar him from ever holding office again.""

Signers of the letter come from over 100 House offices, 15 Senate offices and 10 different committees, including the House Judiciary, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees, according to the organizers.

lvx80t	liberal	The Trump years revealed a dark truth: The Republican Party is no longer committed to democracy.	"The Republican Party is the biggest threat to American democracy today. It is a radical, obstructionist faction that has become hostile to the most basic democratic norm: that the other side should get to wield power when it wins elections.

A few years ago, these statements may have sounded like partisan Democratic hyperbole. But in the wake of the January 6 attack on the Capitol and Trump’s acquittal in the Senate on the charge of inciting it, they seem more a plain description of where we’re at as a country.

But how deep does the GOP’s problem with democracy run, really? How did things get so bad? And is it likely to get worse?

Below are 13 charts that illustrate the depth of the problem and how we got here. The story they tell is sobering: At every level, from the elite down to rank-and-file voters, the party is permeated with anti-democratic political attitudes and agendas. And the prospects for rescuing the Republican Party, at least in the short term, look grim indeed.

Today’s Republicans really hate Democrats — and democracy

1) Trump’s supporters have embraced anti-democratic ideas

This chart shows results from a two-part survey, conducted in late 2020 and early 2021, of hardcore Trump supporters. The political scientists behind the survey, Rachel Blum and Christian Parker, identified so-called “MAGA voters” by their activity on pro-Trump Facebook pages. Their subjects are engaged and committed Republican partisans, disproportionately likely to influence conflicts within the party like primary elections.

These voters, according to Blum and Parker, are hostile to bedrock democratic principles.

They go further than “merely” believing the 2020 election was stolen, a nearly unanimous view among the bunch. Over 90 percent oppose making it easier for people to vote; roughly 70 percent would support a hypothetical third term for Trump (which would be unconstitutional).

“The MAGA movement,” Blum and Parker write, “is a clear and present danger to American democracy.”

2) Republicans are embracing violence

The ultimate expression of anti-democratic politics is resorting to violence. More than twice as many Republicans as Democrats — nearly two in five Republicans — said in a January poll that force could be justified against their opponents.

It would be easy to dismiss this kind of finding as meaningless were it not for the January 6 attack on Capitol Hill — and the survey was conducted about three weeks after the attack. Republicans recently saw what political violence in the United States looked like, and a large fraction of the party faithful seemed comfortable with more of it.

These attitudes are linked to the party elite’s rhetoric: The more party leaders like Trump attack the democratic political system as rigged against them, the more Republicans will believe it and conclude that extreme measures are justifiable. A separate study by political scientists Lilliana Mason and Nathan Kalmoe found that “Republicans who believe Democrats cheated in the election (83 percent in our study) were far likelier to endorse post-election violence.”

3) Republicans see Democrats as something worse than mere rivals

Democracy is, among other things, a system for taming the disagreements inherent in politics: People compete for power under a set of mutually agreeable rules, seeing each other as rivals within a shared system rather than blood enemies.

But in the United States today, hyperpolarization is undoing this basic democratic premise: Sizable numbers of Americans on each side see the members of the other party not as political opponents but as existential threats.

The rise of this dangerous species of “negative partisanship,” as political scientists call it, is asymmetric. While many Democrats see Republicans in a dark light, a majority still see them more as political rivals than as enemies. Among Republicans, however, a solid majority see Democrats as their enemy.

When you believe the opposing party to be an enemy, the costs of letting them win become too high, and anti-democratic behavior — rigging the game in your favor, even outright violence — starts to become thinkable.

4) Republicans dislike compromise

America’s founders designed our political system around compromise. But for years now, majorities of Republican voters have opposed compromise on principle, consistently telling pollsters that they prefer politicians who stick to their ideological guns rather than give a little to get things done. It’s no wonder the past decade saw unprecedented Republican obstructionism in Congress (more on that later).

The hostility to compromise on the GOP side has at least two major implications for democracy.

First, it has rendered government dysfunctional and ineffective — and consequently has decreased public trust in government. Second, it has pushed Democrats in a more polarized direction; in 2018, Pew found, Democratic support for political compromise plummeted to roughly Republican levels. This seems in part like a reaction to years of GOP behavior: If they aren’t going to compromise with us, the Democratic logic goes, then why should we compromise with them?

But the more Democrats eschew compromise, the more cause Republicans have to see them as fundamentally hostile to conservative values — and to redouble their intransigence. It’s a doom loop for political coexistence.

5) The Republican Party is a global outlier — and not in a good way

The Global Party Survey is a 2019 poll of nearly 2,000 experts on political parties from around the world. The survey asked respondents to rate political parties on two axes: the extent to which they are committed to basic democratic principles and their commitment to protecting rights for ethnic minorities.

This chart shows the results of the survey for all political parties in the OECD, a group of wealthy democratic states, with the two major American parties highlighted in red. The GOP is an extreme outlier compared to mainstream conservative parties in other wealthy democracies, like Canada’s CPC or Germany’s CDU. Its closest peers are almost uniformly radical right and anti-democratic parties. This includes Turkey’s AKP (a regime that is one of the world’s leading jailers of journalists), and Poland’s PiS (which has threatened dissenting judges with criminal punishment).

The verdict of these experts is clear: The Republican Party is one of the most anti-democratic political parties in the developed world.

How things got this bad

6) The Republican turn against democracy begins with race

Support for authoritarian ideas in America is closely tied to the country’s long-running racial conflicts.

This chart, from a September 2020 paper by Vanderbilt professor Larry Bartels, shows a statistical analysis of a survey of Republican voters, analyzing the link between respondents’ score on a measure of “ethnic antagonism” and their support for four anti-democratic statements (e.g., “the traditional American way of life is disappearing so fast that we may have to use force to save it”).

The graphic shows a clear finding: The higher a voter scores on the ethnic antagonism scale, the more likely they are to support anti-democratic ideas. This held true even when Bartels used regression analyses to compare racial attitudes to other predictors, like support for Trump. “The strongest predictor by far of these antidemocratic attitudes is ethnic antagonism,” he writes.

For students of American history, this shouldn’t be a surprise.

The 1964 Civil Rights Act and 1965 Voting Rights Act cemented Democrats as the party of racial equality, causing racially resentful Democrats in the South and elsewhere to defect to the Republican Party. This sorting process, which took place over the next few decades, is the key reason America is so polarized.

It also explains why Republicans are increasingly willing to endorse anti-democratic political tactics and ideas. In the past, restrictions on the franchise served to protect white political power in a changing country; today, as demographic change threatens to further undermine the central place of white Americans, many are becoming comfortable with an updated version of the Jim Crow South’s authoritarian tradition.

7) Partisanship causes Republicans to justify anti-democratic behavior

This chart is a little hard to parse, but it illustrates a crucial finding from one of the best recent papers on anti-democratic sentiment in America: how decades of rising partisanship made an anti-democratic GOP possible.

The paper, from Yale’s Matthew Graham and Milan Svolik, uses a number of methods to examine the effect of partisanship on views of democracy. This chart shows a particularly interesting one: a “natural experiment” in Montana’s 2017 at-large House campaign, during which Republican candidate Greg Gianforte assaulted reporter Ben Jacobs during an attempted interview just before Election Day.

Because many voters cast their ballots by mail before the assault happened, Graham and Svolik could compare these to the in-person votes after the assault in order to measure how the news of Gianforte’s attack shifted voters’ behavior.

The blue lines represent precincts where Gianforte did worse on Election Day than in mail-in ballots; the red lines represent the reverse. What you see is a clear trend: In Democratic-leaning and centrist precincts, Gianforte suffered a penalty. But in general, the more right-leaning a precinct was, the less likely he was to suffer — and the more likely he was to improve on his mail-in numbers.

For Svolik and Graham, this illustrates a broader point: Extreme partisanship creates the conditions for democratic decline. If you really care about your side wielding power, you’re more willing to overlook misbehavior in their attempts to win it. They find evidence that this could apply to partisans of either major party — but only one party nominates candidates like Trump and Gianforte (who won not only the 2017 contest but also his reelection bid in 2018 and Montana’s gubernatorial election in 2020).

8) The crucial impact of the right-wing media

The chart here is from a study covering 1997 to 2002, when Fox News was still being rolled out across the country. The study compared members of Congress in districts where Fox News was available to members in districts where it wasn’t, specifically examining how frequently they voted along party lines.

They found that Republicans in districts with Fox grew considerably more likely to vote with the party as it got closer to election time, whereas Republicans without Fox actually grew less likely to do so. The expansion of Fox News, in short, seemingly served a disciplining function: making Republican members of Congress more afraid of the consequences of breaking with the party come election time and thus less inclined to engage in bipartisan legislative efforts.

“Members with Fox News in their district behave as if they believe that more Republicans will turn out at the polls by increasing their support for the Republican Party,” the authors conclude.

How America’s political system creates space for Republicans to undermine democracy

9) Republicans have an unpopular policy agenda

The Republican policy agenda is extremely unpopular. The chart here, taken from Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson’s recent book Let Them Eat Tweets, compares the relative popularity of the two major legislative efforts of Trump’s first term — tax cuts and Obamacare repeal — to similar high-priority bills in years past. The contrast is striking: The GOP’s modern economic agenda is widely disliked even compared to unpopular bills of the past, a finding consistent with a lot of recent polling data.

Hacker and Pierson argue that this drives Republicans’ emphasis on culture war and anti-Democratic identity politics. This strategy, which they term “plutocratic populism,” allows the party’s super-wealthy backers to get their tax cuts while the base gets the partisan street fight they crave.

The GOP can do this because America’s political system is profoundly unrepresentative. The coalition it can assemble — overwhelmingly white Christian, heavily rural, and increasingly less educated — is a shrinking minority that has lost the popular vote in seven of the past eight presidential contests. But its voters are ideally positioned to give Republicans advantages in the Electoral College and the Senate, allowing the party to remain viable despite representing significantly fewer voters than the Democrats do.

10) Some of the most consequential Republican attacks on democracy happen at the state level

This map from the Brennan Center for Justice shows every state that passed a restriction on the franchise between 2010 and 2019. These restrictions, ranging from voter ID laws to felon disenfranchisement, were generally passed by Republican majorities with the intent of hurting turnout among Democratic-leaning constituencies.

Republican state legislators were sometimes explicit about this: “Voter ID ... is gonna allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania,” then-state House Majority Leader Mike Turzai bragged during the 2012 presidential election cycle.

Because Republicans dominated the 2010 midterm elections, Republican statehouses got to control the post-2010 census redistricting process at both the House and state legislative level, leading to extreme gerrymandering in Republican-controlled states unlike anything in Democratic ones.

Conservative control of the Supreme Court enabled this state-level push. In 2013, the Court struck down the Voting Rights Act’s “preclearance” requirement — that states with a history of racial discrimination would be required to get permission from the Justice Department on their maps and other major changes to electoral law. In 2019, another Court ruling paved the way for further partisan gerrymandering.

11) The national GOP has broken government

Today’s Senate, where you need 60 votes to get virtually anything done, is a historical anomaly. Its roots can be traced to the unyielding GOP opposition to President Barack Obama in 2009 and 2010, when Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell turned the Senate into a dysfunctional body in which priority legislation was routinely subject to a filibuster. When Republicans won a Senate majority in 2014, McConnell found a new way to deny Obama victories: blocking his judicial appointments.

These actions were an expression of an attitude popular among Republican voters and leaders alike: that Democrats can never be legitimate leaders, even if elected, and thus do not deserve to wield power.

It’s still Trump’s GOP

12) Republicans didn’t care when Trump abused his power

The Trump presidency was a test of Republican attitudes toward democracy. Time and again, the president abused his authority in ways that would have been unthinkable under previous presidents. Time and again, members of Congress, state party leaders, right-wing media stars, and rank-and-file voters looked the other way — or even cheered him on.

The chart here, which shows two NBC polls taken about a year apart, is particularly striking. It shows that support for Trump’s first and second impeachment among Republicans remained exactly the same among Republicans: 8 percent.

Trump was impeached the first time because he tried to interfere with the integrity of the 2020 presidential election — attempting to strong-arm the Ukrainian president into opening up a bogus investigation into Joe Biden. Trump was impeached the second time because he ginned up a mob to attack the Capitol to disrupt the counting of the votes from the Electoral College.

And yet in both cases, the percentage of Republicans who supported impeaching him was the same — a measly 8 percent. There’s just very little popular appetite in the GOP for punishing anti-democratic excesses by Trump, regardless of the circumstances.

13) Trump and Trumpism could return in 2024

This chart shows the results of a Morning Consult poll on the 2024 Republican primary held after Trump’s second impeachment trial. It found that 54 percent of Republicans would choose Trump again, even when given a wide range of alternative possibilities. Six percent would choose his son Donald Trump Jr. — who obviously wouldn’t run if his father did — putting the Trump family support in the GOP primary electorate at around 60 percent.

This shouldn’t really be surprising.

All the reasons for the GOP’s turn against democracy — backlash to racial progress, rising partisanship, a powerful right-wing media sphere — remain in force after Trump. The leadership is still afraid of Trump and the anti-democratic MAGA movement he commands.

More fundamentally, they are still committed to a political approach that can’t win in a majoritarian system, requiring the defense of the undemocratic status quo in institutions like the Senate and in state-level electoral rules. Republicans still control the bulk of statehouses and are gearing up for a new round of voter suppression bills and extreme gerrymandering in electorally vital states like Georgia and Texas.

It’s very hard to see how any of this gets better. It’s very easy to see how it gets worse.

k9qqq9	liberal	Fired cybersecurity chief sues Trump lawyer over call for him to be shot	"Fired cybersecurity chief Chris Krebs is reportedly suing one of president Trump's lawyers for saying he should be shot.

Mr Krebs, former head of the US government's cybersecurity agency, has filed a lawsuit against Joseph diGenova claiming defamation and distress.

He is seeking monetary damages and demanding the removal of a threatening video held by Newsmax, the outlet where Mr diGenova made the comments, The New York Times reports.

Mr Krebs's lawsuit also claims that Newsmax works closely with Mr diGenova to amplify his attacks on his political opponents, according to the report.

Newsmax has become the favoured media company of Mr Trump and his loyalists as it continues giving air time to their false claims of voter fraud.

Mr Krebs, a lifelong Republican, was axed as the director of the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on 17 November, weeks after the election.

He was given his marching orders after confirming that the election was the cleanest in history, adding: “There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.”

His complaint says that Mr diGenova and Newsmax “hoped to promote and encourage unlawful threats toward, and actual violence upon [Krebs] and Republicans like him—for speaking the truth and performing his constitutional duties without regard to ‘party loyalty.’”

Both Newsmax and Mr diGenova deny that the comments incited violence.

“Anyone who heard the interview knows that it was obviously sarcasm meant in jest,” Mr diGenova told the Daily Beast last month.

“Of course, I wish Mr Krebs no harm whatsoever.”

Newsmax conceded that the comments, made on Boston's The Howie Carr Show, but simulcast on Newsmax, were ""inappropriate"".

But the outlet said Mr Krebs's complaint is a threat to free speech.

""Newsmax believes that claims made by Mr Krebs in his suit of a ‘conspiracy’ and defamation against him are a threat to free speech and his legal action endangers all media organizations that seek an open discourse of ideas and news,” a company spokesperson said.

“Mr diGenova is not a paid contributor to Newsmax... [he] has appeared on Newsmax since then on two occasions stating he made the comment ‘facetiously’ and apologised.”

Mr Krebs said he filed the suit so that he and others from his party are not ""intimidated into silence"".

“We need to make it clear that these behaviours are not acceptable in a civil society,” he added."	left

hhkeoq	liberal	Op-Ed: Trump - We are seeing a true autocrat or dictator in action	"With just over four months until election day, President Donald Trump told an audience of young supporters at a Phoenix megachurch, “We cannot let this happen. They want it to happen so badly,” reports the Associated Press.

After being backed into a corner because of his incompetence in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic in this country, and his rejection of scientific evidence offered by his own health officials, further damage was done to Trump’s presidency when he made a mess out of his handling of the massive protests over police brutality and racism.

Will Bunch, writing for the Philadelphia Enquirer summed it up very well, writing that Trump “tore down the rule of law, abused the presidency to enrich himself, and grabbed the bully pulpit of the White House to divide America with racism, sexism, and xenophobia.”



The death of George Floyd has sparked nationwide protests, including this one in Washington near the US Capitol on June 3, 2020 MANDEL NGAN, AFP

Mr. Bunch was writing about the evening of June 1, when Trump “vowed to dominate the streets while invoking an ancient law, the Insurrection Act of 1807, and threatening to use the U.S. military to end the nationwide protests and growing unrest over the killing of an unarmed 46-year-old black man, George Floyd, at the hands of four Minneapolis cops.”

But keep in mind that Trump’s response to the protests, his phot-op in front of fire-damaged St. John’s Episcopal Church, and no less holding up a bible, were all ploys that badly backfired on the egotistical would-be leader. The public was outraged and they are still outraged.

Undermining the election process

Trump has so far, used every tactic in the “Dictatorships for Dummies” book. And now that the public is finally able to see and understand what he is doing has forced Trump to revert back to his 2016 tactics – which put him in the White House, reports the Star Tribune.

In 2016, Trump first attacked the Republican primaries, claiming they were “rigged and boss controlled.” When he didn’t get the response he expected with the GOP, he accused the media and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton’s campaign of conspiring against him to undermine a free and fair election.

“The process is rigged. This whole election is being rigged,” he said that October when polls showed him trailing Clinton by double digits as he faced a flurry of sexual misconduct allegations.

Well, today, Trump has a hell of a lot more to worry about than sexual misconduct allegations. As for his claims of voter fraud in the 2016 election – they have been discredited by experts in his own party.

But here is what’s interesting and worrisome – Never in the history of this country has a sitting president resorted to purposely trying to delegitimize an election like Trump has done. In fact, you could say that Trump is trying to rupture the public’s faith in American democracy



Dan Rather

“Never,” said presidential historian Douglas Brinkley when asked whether any past U.S. president had ever used such language. “What you’re seeing is someone who’s an autocrat or a dictator in action.”

“Trump is laying down his markers very clearly that he’s not going to leave the White House. I think that he’s just setting the stage,” Brinkley said, to say ”‘I’m not leaving. It was a fraudulent election.’”

Even barring such an extreme move, Brinkley said the president’s rhetoric undermines public confidence in the electoral system. “It creates mayhem and it breaks the heart of what a democracy is.”

Julian Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton University, said Trump may be trying to preempt the sting of humiliation if he fails to win a second term. But Zelizer said Trump also appears to be “setting up the foundation for taking action.” By that, Zeloiger says he could tie up the election results in the courts for a long time.

m674ha	liberal	Greg Abbott Admits There's No Voter Fraud, Insists On 'Election Reform' Anyway	"Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX) admitted on Monday that he knows of no voter fraud cases from the 2020 election despite announcing ""emergency"" election reform legislation.

At a press conference in Houston, Abbott explained why he was including the ""election integrity"" legislation as an emergency item for the Legislature to vote on.

""Our objective is very simple,"" Abbott said. ""And that is to ensure that every eligible voter gets to vote. It's also to ensure that only eligible are the ones that count at the ballot box. The integrity of elections in 2020 were questioned right here in Harris County with the mail-in ballot application process.""

Later in the press conference, Abbott was asked how ""voter fraud influenced election results"" in the 2020 Texas elections.

""It's a little bit more convoluted,"" the governor insisted. ""What we looked for and what we've seen in the past is that election fraud takes place. I have no doubt that it took place here in the state of Texas. We wait for allegations to be made. We don't root it out ourselves.""

""What we have found in the past, there have been some local elections, the outcome was altered by election fraud that took place,"" he continued. ""Right now, I don't how many or if any elections in the state of Texas in 2020 were altered because of voter fraud.""

Over the weekend, Abbott suggested during an interview on Fox News that Democrats could cheat in elections by ""using cocaine to buy votes."""	left
k5edro	liberal	“Do You Want to Actually Get Something Done, or Do You Want to Feel Good?”: Obama Urges Activists to Talk Reforming, Not Defunding, the Police	"Barack Obama’s new memoir, A Promised Land, details not just his time in the White House, but his unconventional journey into politics. The book’s main character isn’t just the former president of the United States. He’s also the biracial kid navigating the hierarchies of race and class in his native Hawaii, the bookish college student who read Marcuse and Marx to flirt with girls, the young community organizer in South Side, Chicago, who earned a real-life education in the limitations of slogans and big promises. Obama’s book is dedicated, in part, to hope that it might inspire more young people to enter public service.

Obama joined Vanity Fair contributor Peter Hamby this week for his Snapchat show, Good Luck America, to talk about youth politics today, the constraints of labels and ideology, his advice for old guard Democrats, his daughter’s SoundCloud, and why some young Black men decided to vote for Donald Trump over Joe Biden in November.

Vanity Fair: President Obama, thanks for joining us.

Barack Obama: It’s good to see you again. How was your Thanksgiving?

It was good. How was yours?

I didn’t cook but I ate a lot.

Do you even cook?

You know, I used to cook, I’ll be honest. I don’t fake it. It’s been 10 years. I haven’t made anything other than an omelet.

So you write in the book about how your grandmother instilled a certain worldview in you that you ended up taking into politics. Values like modesty, humility, hard work, marrying passion with reason. Today, though, if you’re becoming politically sentient on the internet, those aren’t really values that apply. Are you worried that young people on the left today are engaging with politics in a way that is too combative, in ways that value attention and emotion, and that is kind of unhelpful for them as they enter politics and the political conversation?

Well, you know, Malia and Sasha, my daughters, we talk about this. Malia’s 22. Sasha’s 19. And it’s interesting. Even they, and among their friends, notice that sometimes because you’re responding so quickly and trying to be clever or snappy that they sometimes feel as if we’re not really listening to each other as much as we should. We’re just trying to score points. And I think the one thing that I’d like to see all of us do—and shoot, old folks are worse than young folks in many ways about this—is to use social media to make initial contact. But then at least post-COVID, once we get through this pandemic, try to have conversations with people face to face afterward.

You know, I’m dating myself. But when we think about my original campaign, we were early adapters, but we were using, you know, MySpace and Meetup. We’d use social media to initially get people information and to contact them. But then we tried to say, Hey, let’s meet at a bowling alley, or, Let’s meet at this coffee shop and actually have a conversation. And so, you know, that’s where relationships deepen. You start listening to people, you get a better chance to know folks who maybe on the surface seem like they’re different. But maybe if you get to know ’em they might have a point of view that is worth considering.

You write about when you were a community organizer. And a lot of the folks in the communities you were dealing with really just cared about modest change. They want to do better for their families. If you’re a young activist today and you believe really passionately in a slogan, like Defund the Police, what is your advice to that activist? Knowing that a lot of politicians won’t go near that phrase, even if the nuts and bolts of the idea might be popular.

It’s interesting. We take for granted that if you want people to buy your sneakers, that you’re going to market it to your audience, right? We take for granted that if a musician drops a record, that they’re going to try to reach certain audiences by speaking to folks where they are. It’s no different in terms of ideas, right? So if you believe, as I do, that we should be able to reform the criminal justice system so that it’s not biased and treats everybody fairly, I guess you can use a snappy slogan, like Defund the Police, but, you know, you lost a big audience the minute you say it, which makes it a lot less likely that you’re actually going to get the changes you want done. But if you instead say, Hey, you know what? Let’s reform the police department so that everybody’s being treated fairly. And not just in policing, but in sentencing, how can we divert young people from getting into crime? And if there was a homeless guy, can maybe we send a mental health worker there instead of an armed unit that could end up resulting in a tragedy? You know, suddenly a whole bunch of folks who might not otherwise listen to you are listening to you. So the key is deciding, do you want to actually get something done, or do you want to feel good among the people you already agree with? And if you want to get something done in a democracy, in a country as big and diverse as ours, then you’ve got to be able to meet people where they are. And play a game of addition and not subtraction."	left

hdrruz	liberal	Racism, Lies, and Empty Seats: The Embarrassment That Was Trump's Rally	"President Trump’s first rally since the coronavirus took hold in the U.S. provided an unsurprising disaster of a speech, but the sparse crowd in attendance after the campaign touted ticket requests of over a million was a stunning surprise that sent Trump allies scurrying for excuses.

Trump’s embarrassing speech on Saturday night in Tulsa hit on all of the familiar themes. Racism, when referring to COVID-19 as “Kung Flu.” A slew of lies that included a false claim that violent protesters attempted to disrupt the rally outside of the BOK Center. “We had a bunch of maniacs come and sort of attack our city,” Trump said.

The President uses the term “Kung flu” pic.twitter.com/yMlGLCRix3 — Acyn Torabi (@Acyn) June 21, 2020

Trump’s omissions were also not a surprise but stunning nonetheless. The president made no mention of George Floyd, the Black Wall Street massacre that took place in Tulsa in 1921, or Juneteenth, the anniversary that marks the end of slavery, which Trump claimed to have made “very famous” this week.

But most important to this pathologically egocentric president must have been the emptiness he felt inside when he stared at all on the empty seats in the arena while he stood at the podium, airing his many grievances.

According to the New York Times, Trump was “furious” about the lack of an overflow crowd that forced the dismantling of an outdoor stage. And Forbes is reporting that only 6,200 of the 19,200 seats in the arena were filled, a far cry from Trump’s campaign manager Brad Parscale’s boasts of over one million ticket requests to hear the president speak.

Trump’s most egregious moment came when he claimed that he told health officials to “slow down testing” for COVID-19 because more testing means more cases, and that makes him look bad.

""When you do testing to that extent, you are going to find more people, you will find more cases. So I said slow the testing down.""

Of course, the White House later tried to clean up Trump’s mess by saying the president was joking. But he was not. It’s a talking point he has used repeatedly in recent weeks. And Rep. Andy Kim (D-N.J.) said on Twitter that FEMA recently refused to help set up a testing site in South Jersey because the White House wouldn’t allow it. “When I requested FEMA to stand up a Coronavirus test site in South Jersey they told me the White House said no. Now we know why,” he tweeted.

Finally, Trump seemed to have prepped most for his attempt to quell the talk about his possible failing health when he went into an expansive explanation of the viral moments where he appeared to struggle walking down a ramp and drinking water during a commencement address at the West Point military academy last weekend.

Oddly, the loudest cheers of the night came when Trump proved he could drink water from a glass.

gq8in8	liberal	We Need to Speak Honestly About the GOP’s Evolution Into a Conspiracy Cult	"One of the challenges in analyzing modern American politics is accurately describing the Republican Party without seeming unserious and hyperbolic. Major publications are understandably in the habit of presenting both sides of the partisan divide as being inherently worthy of respect and equal consideration, both as a way of shielding themselves from accusations of bias and as a way of maintaining their own sense of journalistic integrity.

Unfortunately, the modern Republican Party’s abdication of seriousness, good faith and reality-based communications or policy-making has stretched even the most open-minded analyst’s capacity for forced balance. Donald Trump’s own inability to string together coherent or consistent thoughts has led to a bizarre normalization of his statements in the traditional media, as journalists unconsciously try to fit his rambling, spontaneous utterances into a conventional framework. This has come at the cost of Americans seeing the full truth of the crisis of leadership in the Oval Office for what it is. For instance, it was ironically salutary for the American public to witness Donald Trump’s bizarre pandemic press conferences where he oddly attacked reporters for asking innocuous questions and recommended researching bleach and sunlight injections, because they got to see Trump raw as he truly is, without the normalization filter. Republicans have long argued that the “mainstream media filter” gives them a bad shake, but the reality is the opposite: sure, it’s not as good as being boosted by Fox News’ overt propaganda, but it does them a greater service than letting the public see them unfiltered at all.

But there comes a tipping point at which it becomes too dangerous to keep up the pretense. Most people left of center would argue (rightly, I believe) that we hit that point long, long ago and the time to re-evaluate journalistic norms and practices should have been decades earlier when the GOP was busy covering up the Iran Contra scandal and promoting the Laffer Curve as serious public policy. Or that any number of catastrophes of conservative public policy and norm erosion since should have sounded the alarms along the way, from the Bush v Gore decision and the Brooks Brothers Riots to the lies justifying the invasion of Iraq, to the deregulation-fueled Wall Street crash, birtherism, the Benghazi obsession and the nomination of Donald Trump. Many would point with legitimate outrage to the abdication of responsibility in the face of climate change, yawning inequality, forced family separation policy, children in cages and so much else.

But even faced with awful consequences of all these horrors, a defender of traditional journalism might simply chalk them up to policy differences in a democratic society. They would be wrong to do so, but the position would be intellectually defensible in principle.

But recently there has been a shift among GOP voters that is different not just in degree of virulence, but also in kind. For a host of different reasons, core Republican voters have begun to reconstitute themselves as a conspiracy theory cult devoted to beliefs that were once relegated to the farthest fringe–fictions that cannot help but end in civil conflict and violence if they fully become canon among conservative voters nationwide. This process arguably began as far back as Glenn Beck’s prominence on Fox News, but it has now blossomed into a grandiose collective paranoid fantasy.

Being a Republican now requires believing in a jaw-dropping series of claims that, if true, would almost necessitate anti-democratic revanchism. One has to believe that a cabal of evil scientists is making up climate science in exchange for grant money; that there is rampant, widescale voter impersonation fraud carried out by thousands of elections officials nationwide; that the “Deep State” concocted a scheme to frame Trump for Russian collusion but chose not to use it before the 2016 election; that shadowy forces are driving migrant caravans and diseases across American borders in the service of destroying white Republican America; that the entire news media is engaged in a conspiracy against the Republican Party; that grieving victims of gun violence and their families all across America want to take away guns as a pretext for stomping the boot of “liberal fascism” on conservative faces; and so on. That and much more is just the vanilla Republican belief system at this point (not even touching less explosive academic fictions like “tax cuts pay for themselves” or “the poor will work harder to better themselves if you cut the safety net.”)

But things have gotten even worse in the few years short years since the Trump era began. Once a far-fringe conspiracy theory relegated to 8chan and neo-nazi filled knockoffs of Reddit, the QAnon conspiracy theory (which, among other things, posits that a wide swath of prominent Democrats, celebrities and assorted rich people are engaged in pedophilia and adrenochrome harvesting of children, and that the Trump Administration is always just a few weeks away from conducting mass arrests and summary executions–but only once QANON followers have awakened enough of the “normie” public) has become so pervasive that not only do “Q” signs pop up at almost every major conservative rally or protest, but a true believer is now the GOP nominee for Senate in Oregon. When her campaign attempted to backtrack, she doubled down, saying “”My campaign is gonna kill me…How do I say this? Some people think that I follow Q like I follow Jesus. Q is the information and I stand with the information resource.” This conspiracy theory is destroying families, relationships, and the mental health of its adherents. A healthy and normal political party would inoculate itself from it and debunk it quickly. But the GOP is not a healthy or normal political party.

It doesn’t stop there. Almost half of Fox News viewers—the core of the GOP—believe that Bill Gates is using the COVID-19 pandemic to microchip them. And Donald Trump has been promoting a series of conspiracy theories on twitter each more outlandish than the last, from old debunked accusations against cable news hosts he dislikes to concocted accusations against former president Barack Obama.

Go to any conservative event and you’ll notice a shift from even the raucous detached weirdness of Tea Party rallies. They feel less like political events than cult rallies. Cult experts like Steven Hassan have taken note of this, calling it exactly what it is: a cult built around manufactured realities, shared grievances and us-against-them insular extremism. The increasing dependence of Republican politicians on a shrinking, embattled white evangelical base already given over to faith-based belief systems and racism-tinged “city on a hill” ideology has only exacerbated the phenomenon.

It’s long past time for even the venerable pages of the New York Times and the Washington Post to start calling this what it is, and stop normalizing it as standard partisanship. It is deeply dangerous in a democracy whose constitution functionally guarantees a two-party system, for one of those two parties to become a conspiracy cult.

But that is exactly what has happened. And the first step to fixing it is to call it what it is, no matter how uncomfortable that might be for institutions and journalism professionals who find that sort of language loaded with unprofessional bias. The truth is what it is, even if it requires rethinking the role of a responsible press in an era of white anxiety and mass social-media-fueled disinformation."	left
mf3sx1	liberal	President Joe Biden said the Justice Department is looking into a new law in Georgia restricting access to voting, which he called an 'atrocity'	"President Joe Biden said the Justice Department is looking at new voting laws in Georgia.

The bill restricts voting access, and have been compared to racist Jim Crow laws.

The bill faces legal challenges, with civil rights groups saying it violates the Constitution.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

President Joe Biden said that the Justice Department is ""taking a look at"" a sweeping new bill in Georgia restricting voting rights he described as an ""atrocity.""

The new law was signed by Republican governor Brian Kemp on Thursday, and places stricter requirements on providing identification for voters casting absentee ballots, limits the number of drop boxes for ballots, gives state officials more power over how elections are run, and bans giving food and drink to people waiting in line to vote.

In remarks to reporters, Biden called the move an ""atrocity"" and ""Jim Crow for the 21st Century.""

When a reporter asked how the White House would respond, Biden replied: ""We're working on that right now.""

""We don't know quite exactly what we can do at this point. The Justice Department's taking a look as well,"" Biden said.

""It has nothing to do with fairness, nothing to do with decency. They passed the law saying you can't provide water for people standing in line while they're waiting to vote? You don't need anything else to know that this is nothing but punitive, designed to keep people from voting. You can't provide water for people about to vote? Give me a break,"" he said.

Critics have likened the Georgia bill to the ""Jim Crow"" laws that enforced racial segregation in the South, saying that they will disproportionately impact Black voters who have been pivotal to recent Democratic victories in the state.

Biden became the first Democratic presidential contender to win the state since 1991 last year, and in January's Senate runoff elections in January, both Democratic candidates were victorious.

In a statement Friday, Biden urged Congress to pass a sweeping voting rights bill designed by Democrats to counteract attempts by Republicans to restrict voting.

The bill has passed the House but is unlikely to muster the 60 votes in the Senate required to overcome a potential Republican filibuster.

The Georgia bill faces several challenges from civil rights groups, who argue that it violates the US Constitution's First and Fourteenth amendments and the 1965 Voting Rights Act forbidding states from passing laws to reduce minority participation in elections.

Georgia Governor Brian Kemp has denied the Georgia law is a bid to disenfranchise Black voters.

""There is nothing 'Jim Crow' about requiring a photo or state-issued ID to vote by absentee ballot – every Georgia voter must already do so when voting in-person,"" he said. ""President Biden, the left, and the national media are determined to destroy the sanctity and security of the ballot box.""

Republicans have long claimed that elections are exposed to widespread fraud, and Donald Trump, after his defeat last year, has pushed the claim, dismissed in a slew of court cases, that his loss resulted from widespread fraud."	left
l88mk4	liberal	Pro-Trump lawyer Lin Wood puts license in jeopardy by refusing mental health evaluation	"(Reuters) - L. Lin Wood, a lawyer who played a role in former President Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn his election defeat, put his law license in jeopardy on Friday by saying on social media that he would not undergo a mental health evaluation requested by an attorney licensing body.

Wood said on the app Telegram on Thursday that the State Bar of Georgia had told him he needed to submit to the evaluation to keep his law license.

In a subsequent post on Friday, Wood said he would decline the request and “litigate” with the state bar if necessary.

“I have done nothing wrong. I have only exercised my right of free speech,” Wood said in that post. “I will not allow the State Bar to persecute me for doing so and thereby violate my Constitutional rights.”

State Bar of Georgia Chief Operating Officer Sarah Coole confirmed that Wood had been asked to undergo a mental health evaluation but declined to comment further.

The development comes weeks after Wood, an Atlanta-based defamation litigator, was banned from Twitter, where he regularly embraced conspiracy theories.

A Delaware state judge earlier this month blocked Wood from representing former Trump adviser Carter Page, calling claims Wood made on Twitter about U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts “too disgusting and outrageous to repeat.”

Wood was also fired in January by a Kentucky teenager who sued media outlets over their portrayal of his stand-off with a Native American activist in Washington in 2019.

It is unusual but legal for a state bar to ask a lawyer to submit to such an evaluation, said Brian Faughnan, a lawyer in Tennessee who advises attorneys on ethics matters.

Such requests are kept confidential, but in this case Wood “waived” that right to confidentiality by posting on social media, he said."	left
gktjbu	liberal	Hydroxychloroquine: Drug promoted by Trump as coronavirus ‘game changer’ increasingly linked to deaths	"It is a drug that Donald Trump hyped as a “game changer” in the fight against coronavirus.

“The nice part is it’s been around for a long time,” the US president said of anti-malaria treatment hydroxychloroquine in March. “So, we know that if things don’t go as planned, it’s not going to kill anybody.”

New evidence suggests it may be doing just that.

Data from clinical trials, academic research and scientific analysis suggests using the drug to treat Covid-19 may significantly increase the risk of death for certain people.

A study of Veterans Affairs patients hospitalised with the new illness found no benefit and higher death rates among those taking hydroxychloroquine, researchers have said.

More than 27 per cent of patients treated died, compared with an 11.4 per cent death rate in those not treated with the drugs, the Washington Post reports.

Now, drug safety experts are calling for the treatment’s use to be entirely halted until more is understood about it.

“They should say, ‘We know there are harms, and until we know the benefits, let’s hold off’,” Joseph Ross, a professor of medicine and public health at Yale University, told the Post.

Another expert, Luciana Borio – who has previously served as director for medical and biodefense preparedness of the National Security Council – was just as succinct in her assessment: “I’m surprised it hasn’t been revoked yet,” she said.

The new calls come in the same week a former top vaccine official gave testimony alleging the White House pressured the Food and Drug Administration to quickly sign off on the untested drug in a flailing bid to tackle covid-19.

Rick Bright, former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, told Congress on Thursday political pressure forced “dozens of federal scientists” to rush produce a protocol for approving hydroxychloroquine for widespread use.

Although in the end the FDA issued emergency authorisation for use in hospital patients only, Mr Bright said there were still major “potential risks” because there were so many unknowns.

lhjrbt	liberal	Exclusive: Dozens of former Republican officials in talks to form anti-Trump third party	"(Reuters) - Dozens of former Republican officials, who view the party as unwilling to stand up to former President Donald Trump and his attempts to undermine U.S. democracy, are in talks to form a center-right breakaway party, four people involved in the discussions told Reuters.

The early stage discussions include former elected Republicans, former officials in the Republican administrations of Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush and Trump, ex-Republican ambassadors and Republican strategists, the people involved say.

More than 120 of them held a Zoom call last Friday to discuss the breakaway group, which would run on a platform of “principled conservatism,” including adherence to the Constitution and the rule of law - ideas those involved say have been trashed by Trump.

The plan would be to run candidates in some races but also to endorse center-right candidates in others, be they Republicans, independents or Democrats, the people say.

Evan McMullin, who was chief policy director for the House Republican Conference and ran as an independent in the 2016 presidential election, told Reuters that he co-hosted the Zoom call with former officials concerned about Trump’s grip on Republicans and the nativist turn the party has taken.

Three other people confirmed to Reuters the call and the discussions for a potential splinter party, but asked not to be identified.

Among the call participants were John Mitnick, general counsel for the Department of Homeland Security under Trump; former Republican congressman Charlie Dent; Elizabeth Neumann, deputy chief of staff in the Homeland Security Department under Trump; and Miles Taylor, another former Trump homeland security official.

The talks highlight the wide intraparty rift over Trump’s false claims of election fraud and the deadly Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol. Most Republicans remain fiercely loyal to the former president, but others seek a new direction for the party.

The House of Representatives impeached Trump on Jan. 13 on a charge of inciting an insurrection by exhorting thousands of supporters to march on the Capitol on the day Congress was gathered to certify Democrat Joe Biden’s election victory.

Call participants said they were particularly dismayed by the fact that more than half of the Republicans in Congress - eight senators and 139 House representatives - voted to block certification of Biden’s election victory just hours after the Capitol siege.

Most Republican senators have also indicated they will not support the conviction of Trump in this week’s Senate impeachment trial.

“Large portions of the Republican Party are radicalizing and threatening American democracy,” McMullin told Reuters. “The party needs to recommit to truth, reason and founding ideals or there clearly needs to be something new.”

‘THESE LOSERS’

Asked about the discussions for a third party, Jason Miller, a Trump spokesman, said: “These losers left the Republican Party when they voted for Joe Biden.”

A representative for the Republican National Committee referred to a recent statement from Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel.

“If we continue to attack each other and focus on attacking on fellow Republicans, if we have disagreements within our party, then we are losing sight of 2022 (elections),” McDaniel said on Fox News last month.

“The only way we’re going to win is if we come together,” she said.

The Biden White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

McMullin said just over 40% of those on last week’s Zoom call backed the idea of a breakaway, national third party. Another option under discussion is to form a “faction” that would operate either inside the current Republican Party or outside it.

Names under consideration for a new party include the Integrity Party and the Center Right Party. If it is decided instead to form a faction, one name under discussion is the Center Right Republicans.

Members are aware that the U.S. political landscape is littered with the remains of previous failed attempts at national third parties.

“But there is a far greater hunger for a new political party out there than I have ever experienced in my lifetime,” one participant said."	left
kwwgil	liberal	Donald Trump becomes the first US president to be impeached for a second time - live	"02:45

1. There are signs of a deep split within the Republican party

Some of the most high-profile members of Republican leadership aren’t denouncing the Democratic effort. Quite the contrary. Congresswoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, announced on Tuesday that she would join Democrats and a handful of House Republicans in voting to impeach Trump.

2. The most bipartisan impeachment in American history

Unlike the last time Democrats impeached Trump, there’s a higher level of bipartisan support for the move. Congressman Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader and top-ranking Republican in that chamber, said during a speech on Wednesday that Trump was partially to blame for the mob assault on the Capitol last week.

3. The vast majority of Republicans refused to concede any fault

Throughout the debate on Wednesday two patterns emerged among the arguments Republicans made: deflect and denounce. Republicans repeatedly denounced the mob attack last week.

4. The Senate is a mystery

How things will shake out in the Senate is a mystery. McConnell wrote in a letter to colleagues that he has not “made a final decision on how I will vote and I intend to listen to legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate”.

5. Democrats’ security concerns seem well-founded

Reporters and lawmakers noted the increased security presence around the Capitol. Congressman Seth Moulton of Massachusetts noted in his floor speech that there were more US soldiers patrolling the Capitol than were stationed in Afghanistan.

koiqvi	liberal	Veteran Republican criticizes Trump and suggests US may need new party for ‘moderate conservatives’	"A former Republican senator and defense secretary has suggested it may be time for moderate conservatives to form a new political party as he launched a withering attack on the lawmakers supporting Donald Trump's bid to overturn the election result.

William Cohen, who represented Maine before taking up the defense role in the Clinton administration in 1997, said there is now ""a real division"" within the GOP and compared Mr Trump's backers in Congress to circus elephants trying to please their ""ringmaster"".

His comments came after Missouri senator Josh Hawley announced that he will challenge Congress's certification of president-elect Joe Biden's election victory on 6th January.

Despite losing both the electoral college and popular vote, Mr Trump and his legal team continue to insist that the election was ""rigged"". But Trump team is yet to present any credible evidence that mass voter fraud took place on election day.

A number of Republicans in the House of Representatives have declared that they will challenge Mr Biden's victory when Congress meets to certify the result next week.

Senator Hawley's announcement made him the first GOP lawmaker in the second chamber to voice support for the defeated president's efforts to subvert democracy.

Announcing his decision, Mr Hawley claimed that Pennsylvania did not follow state election laws and said the “unprecedented effort of mega corporations” like Facebook and Twitter interfered with the election to support president-elect Biden. He also urged Congress to investigate allegations of voter fraud.

Crucially, Mr Hawley’s backing means that both the House and the Senate will now be forced to debate the results of at least one state and vote on whether to accept Mr Biden's win.

It will not change the outcome of the election, but it sets up a scenario that Senate majority leader Mitchell McConnell wanted to avoid, saying it would be highly damaging for the party.

Speaking to CNN on Thursday, Mr Cohen, 80, suggested that ""maybe it's time for a new party"", when asked about the state of the GOP and the power Mr Trump continues to exert over it.

""[A party] that abides by the rule of law, abides by balanced budget opportunities, fiscal responsibility. A party that is faithful to the people of this country who vote to elect them,"" a visibly annoyed Mr Cohen added.

Mr Cohen also lashed out at those Congressional Republicans emboldening Mr Trump's bid to frustrate the will of the American people, suggesting they will be forever indebted to a president who ""cannot be satisfied"".

""The current occupant of the White House is a ringmaster, and what he expects to do is to snap his whip and all the elephants jump on the chairs,"" he said.

""What they have to understand, those who are so eager to support this effort to overturn the vote...what they have to understand is that he is going to continue to snap the whip whether he is in office or out of office.""

He added: ""And every time they are going to have to sit on that stool in order to satisfy him and his supporters"".

Mr Cohen also called on a number of more moderate Republicans including Mitt Romney (Utah), Susan Collins (Maine) and Ben Sasse (Nebraska) to do everything in their power to oppose the senators backing Mr Trump.

Mr Sasse was one of those Republicans who called out Mr Hawley's move to delay certifying the Congress vote as he urged his colleagues not to follow suit.

Writing on Facebook, he said: ""The president and his allies are playing with fire. They have been asking - first the courts, then state legislatures, now the Congress - to overturn the results of a presidential election.

""They have unsuccessfully called on judges and are now calling on federal officeholders to invalidate millions and millions of votes. If you make big claims, you had better have the evidence. But the president doesn't and neither do the institutional arsonist members of Congress who will object to the electoral college vote.""

Mr Trump welcomed Mr Hawley's support. ""America is proud of Josh and the many others who are joining him,"" he tweeted yesterday. “The USA cannot have fraudulent elections!”"	left
kjs05m	liberal	"Prosecutors have ""mounting amount of evidence"" against Trump, Michael Cohen says"	"President Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, says he is ""not interested"" in a presidential pardon — and claims Mr. Trump is going to face legal issues of his own soon after leaving the White House.

""It has to do with his finances, it has to do with his tax returns, it has to do with his properties, it has to do with the personal financial statements that he had made and provided in order to obtain loans,"" Cohen said on CBSN Thursday.

A number of investigations could cause legal trouble for Mr. Trump after he leaves office in January, including potential congressional inquiries as well as probes by the attorneys general of New York and Washington, D.C. and the Manhattan district attorney.

Cohen said he had been questioned by the state attorney general's team and the district attorney's office and claimed investigators are ""well-prepared"" with their evidence to ""move relatively quickly"" in their probes.

""I do believe that there is a mounting amount of evidence that they will be prosecuting upon,"" Cohen said. ""Some of it of course is civil, and other parts of it are criminal.""

Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to charges of fraud, campaign violations and lying to Congress and was sentenced to 3 years in prison. He was granted home confinement due to the pandemic earlier this year. President Trump has repeatedly blasted Cohen as a known liar, but Cohen says he has documents to back up his claims.

There is currently only one publicly known investigation that could lead to criminal charges for Mr. Trump, led by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. It initially targeted hush-money payments made during the 2016 campaign to adult film star Stormy Daniels, but Vance's office has since indicated in court filings that it has widened to look at possible crimes as wide-ranging as fraud and tax evasion.

However, the timeline of Vance's investigation is unclear. His seat is up for grabs in 2021, and the case is unlikely to be resolved until a new district attorney is in office.

Cohen declined to comment on any specifics of what he told investigators, but said ""I know what it is that they're looking for"" and asserted that they already have a ""multitude of evidence"" built up.

Asked about the president's mindset, Cohen, who worked as Mr. Trump's ""fixer"" for years before their public rift, said: ""What he is right now is very, very nervous and he is very scared because in 27 days he knows that Joe Biden is going to be sworn in, and that's when there's going to be a plethora of litigation and subpoenas that are going to be flying around that he cannot control anymore.""

Cohen admitted to lying for the president to cover up what he now calls Mr. Trump's ""dirty deeds.""

""When I started to realize that I was being used by Trump and the administration as his scapegoat, I didn't want to end up being remembered in history as the villain of Donald Trump's story,"" Cohen said on CBSN.

Unlike Mr. Trump's associates Paul Manafort, Roger Stone and Michael Flynn, among others, Cohen has not received a pardon from the president — and he ""didn't expect one,"" either.

""I truly believe that those who were accepting Trump's filth will have the stench of corruption following their name and their family's names for decades to come,"" he said. ""It's just another disgraceful Trump act.""

The president began announcing various pardons and commutations Wednesday evening. Among the first were Flynn, who briefly served as national security adviser before pleading guilty to lying to the FBI, and former Trump campaign staffer George Papadopoulos. Pardons for Stone and Manafort were announced the next evening.

All four of those Trump allies, like Cohen, were indicted on charges stemming from the Mueller investigation.

io45kl	liberal	Trump ridiculed after bizarre rant about 'anarchists throwing soup' resurfaces	"2020 has been a rough year for Donald Trump and the United States.

Not only has he done a terrible job of handling the coronavirus pandemic but he has also faced months and months' worth of Black Lives Matter protests following the death of unarmed Black people in the US at the hands of police.

Rather than offer words of support or a solution to the decades-long problem, Trump has criticised the protesters and even suggested that Black Lives Matter is 'discriminatory' and 'bad for Black people.'

Just a few weeks ago, on July 31, the president went on a bizarre rant about protesters and soup, which he claimed was being thrown at police. Yes, you read that correctly – soup.

Speaking during a meeting with the National Association of Police Organizations Leadership, the president said:

In cities across the nation, we’ve also seen police officers assaulted with bricks, rocks, bats, Molotov cocktails, frozen bottles of water. Somebody said last night, one of the protesters — I saw it — he said, 'It’s only water. How can water hurt you?' Yeah, they don’t say it’s frozen, in a bottle the size of a football. And they throw it at the police. It’s unbelievable. 'It’s water.' And then they have cans of soup. Soup. And they throw the cans of soup. That’s better than a brick because you can’t throw a brick; it’s too heavy. But a can of soup, you can really put some power into that, right?

He added:

And then, when they get caught, they say, 'No, this is soup for my family.' They’re so innocent. 'This is soup for my family.' It’s incredible. And you have people coming over with bags of soup — big bags of soup. And they lay it on the ground, and the anarchists take it and they start throwing it at our cops, at our police. And if it hits you, that’s worse than a brick because that’s got force. It’s the perfect size. It’s, like, made perfect. And when they get caught, they say, 'No, this is just soup for my family.' And then the media says, 'This is just soup. These people are very, very innocent. They’re innocent people. These are just protesters. Isn’t it wonderful to allow protesting?'

It's hard to know exactly what Trump has a grievance with here. Is it the protesters or the soup? Regardless, the bonkers rant has been widely ridiculed on social media.

There was the inevitable comparison to the famous 'Soup Nazi' episode from Seinfeld.

It's amazing that this took so long to come to light but we can at least be thankful that it is in the world now. We can't wait to see what Joe Biden will make of this..."	left
jkdv80	liberal	Counties that pivoted to Trump had lower wage growth than other counties	"In the home stretch to next week’s election, a number of articles have attempted to rebut claims that the Trump administration has practiced “phony” populism. But the only piece of real-world evidence these articles cite to defend the Trump administration’s record in helping working-class voters turns out to be either false or highly misleading.

Specifically, one of the articles defending the Trump record, by Alan Tonelson, highlights wage growth in “pivot counties”—counties that voted for Obama twice but then voted for Trump—and claims that “Average annual private-sector pay in most of these [pivot] counties rose faster during the first three years of the Trump administration than during the last three years of the [sic] Mr. Obama’s presidency.”

In Tonelson’s telling, this wage growth justifies the vote-flipping in those counties between Obama and Trump because the Trump administration has done something that has boosted wage growth in these presumably blue-collar counties. But Tonelson’s analysis is wrong, for a number of reasons.

First, our calculations show that pivot counties didn’t see faster wage growth on average. As Figure A shows, between 2013 and 2016 average real annual pay in pivot counties grew by 4.3%, and between 2016 and 2019 these pivot county average earnings grew by just 2.2%. In all other (nonpivot) counties, the slowdown in earnings growth was smaller: Average earnings grew by 4.0% in the first period and then 3.1% in the second period.

It is true, as Tonelson notes, that a majority of pivot counties had faster nominal wage growth in the Trump period: By our calculations, 57% of pivot counties had faster nominal growth in the Trump period. But pivot counties actually fared worse than other counties: 67% of nonpivot counties also saw faster nominal growth. In addition, after accounting for inflation, only 33% of pivot counties saw faster real average pay rise. Nonpivot counties fared slightly better: 43% of nonpivot counties had faster real pay growth.

In short, average wage growth in pivot counties fell further behind nonpivot counties during the Trump administration, regardless of whether or not one accounts for inflation. In fact, inflation-adjusted wage growth for pivot counties in the second Obama administration was faster than for nonpivot counties, yet this pattern outright reversed during the Trump administration.

The lack of evidence supporting claims that the working class has prospered under the Trump administration should shock nobody—the policy record is clear that the administration’s claims to care about working-class voters’ economic plight were indeed phony. The Trump administration prioritized tax cuts for corporations, repealing access to affordable health coverage, and wrecking any institution or labor standard that gives typical workers leverage or bargaining power. The administration also did not push to raise the minimum wage, but did push to appoint hard-money cranks and reliable conservative partisans to the Federal Reserve.

It is true that some pockets of strength in wage growth have appeared during the Trump administration. But these can mostly be explained by state-level actions in raising minimum wages and a continued tightening of the labor market before 2020—a steady improvement that Trump inherited from the previous administration and which can be chalked up mostly to the Fed’s admirable forbearance in raising interest rates.

It is certainly true that working class voters’ economic interests were disproportionately ignored (or even constrained) before the Trump administration, but this disadvantage only increased during the past four years. Given the policy record of the Trump administration, this should come as no surprise—everything they have tried to do has privileged the already-rich and harmed everybody else."	left
miuav3	liberal	Reports: Gaetz Caught On Surveillance Vid With Alleged Sex Trafficker Sifting Through IDs	"As time goes on, things get worse for Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) and his friend, the former Seminole County tax collector and now alleged sex trafficker Joel Greenberg.

Gaetz has acknowledged that he’s under federal investigation, but he’s denied wrongdoing and attempted to change the topic, claiming that the probe is part of a seemingly separate extortion attempt aimed at him and his family. Authorities are reportedly investigating whether Gaetz had sex with a 17-year-old, and whether she received anything of value.

Greenberg has also pleaded not guilty to the trafficking charge and a long list of other federal offenses on which he’s been indicted.

But new reports dig the congressman into deeper trouble.

CNN reported overnight that an employee at the tax collector’s office once saw Greenberg and Gaetz on an internal surveillance video, looking through driver licenses on a weekend evening.

The Daily Beast and The Orlando Sentinel, meanwhile, reported that surveillance camera footage showed Greenberg and another man in the Lake Mary branch of the tax collector’s office at night.

An employee at that office reportedly arrived on Monday morning to find driver licenses scattered on the desk, instead of in a disposal basket. She told her boss, who asked Greenberg what had happened in a text message. The text, which the Daily Beast said was dated April 16, 2018, was shared with federal investigators last January, the outlets reported.

“Did you happen to visit the Lake Mary Office on the weekend?” the message read, according to the Daily Beast.

“Yes I was showing congressman Gaetz what our operation looked like,” Greenberg reportedly replied. “Did I leave something on?”

It’s unclear if federal investigators have access to that surveillance footage — Seminole County officials told the Daily Beast and the Orlando Sentinel that surveillance video is deleted after 60 days.

But the reported nighttime rummaging through seemingly discarded ID cards fits with existing allegations against Greenberg.

As part of the 33 counts — spread across four indictments — against Greenberg, a grand jury alleged that he “used his access to the Seminole County Tax Collector’s Office to take surrendered driver licenses before they were shredded.”

Greenberg also used his access to a state database, the Florida Driver and Vehicle Information Database (DAVID), to run searches that weren’t for any permissible use, the grand jury alleged of the former tax collector.

What’s more, Greenberg is alleged to have obtained and used the personal information about individuals with whom he was engaged in “sugar daddy” relationships, according to the indictments.

And, in addition to allegedly using the information from others’ discarded licenses to make fake IDs with his own face on them, Greenberg is also accused of using DAVID records to facilitate his efforts to engage in commercial sex acts.

On September 4, 2017, Greenberg allegedly illegally obtained the name, photograph and driver identification number of the “Minor Victim” discussed in the indictments — a girl between 14 and 17 years old who Greenberg is accused of causing to engage in a commercial sex act sometime between May and November 2017.

This is where new reporting, again, makes things worse for Gaetz: The New York Times reported Thursday that Greenberg met women through websites such as Seeking Arrangement — a destination for so-called Sugar Daddy/Baby relationships — and then introduced them to Gaetz for sex.

The Times also reported that the 17-year-old girl federal investigators are trying to determine whether Gaetz had sex with is the same girl that is discussed in the sex trafficking count against Greenberg.

In other words: Greenberg is accused of illegally accessing the government information of a 17-year-old girl in 2017, and also of sex trafficking her. And new reporting indicates that authorities are aware of a 2018 text message in which Greenberg acknowledges bringing Gaetz by a branch of the tax collector’s office at night, where an employee later found a mess of IDs scattered on a desk.

Does Rep. Gaetz recall this nighttime visit? Does he dispute any part of these three reports? Was he aware of Greenberg’s alleged abuse of a government database and discarded driver licenses? Was Gaetz ever aware that Greenberg was allegedly using illegally obtained personal information in furtherance of a sex crime?

The congressman’s office didn’t respond to TPM’s questions Friday."	left

l0ipbp	liberal	FBI investigating whether Capitol assault suspect tried to sell Pelosi computer to Russian intelligence service	"The FBI said it got a tip from a former romantic partner she is seen in a video.

The FBI is investigating whether a woman who allegedly participated in the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol stole a computer or hard drive from the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with the intention of selling it to Russia's intelligence service.

According to an FBI criminal complaint filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., Sunday, a witness called the FBI with a tip that a Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, woman, Riley June Williams, is seen in a video published by ITV, a British broadcasting network, depicting Williams' presence in the Capitol during the riot.

The witness told the FBI they were formerly a romantic partner of Williams. The witness claimed to have spoken to friends of Williams who allegedly showed the witness a video of Williams ""taking a laptop or hard drive from Pelosi's office,"" according to the complaint.

The sale to Russia fell through, according to the witness account described by the FBI in the complaint, and Williams ""still has the computer device or destroyed it."" The matter remains under investigation, the document stated.

The complaint alleges Williams committed the criminal violations of entering restricted building and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds. On Tuesday, the Justice Department filed two additional charges against Williams -- federal theft and obstruction of an official proceeding.

In the amended filing Tuesday, the DOJ confirms an HP laptop was stolen from Pelosi's office and cites a Discord post allegedly from Williams saying she stole from Pelosi's office. The new filing also includes multiple screenshots of videos allegedly taken from inside Pelosi's office, including one of an HP laptop being stolen.

""A female voice that I believe to be WILLIAMS’ based on my review of the ITV YouTube video described above can be heard saying, 'Dude, put on gloves,'"" the FBI agent says in the affidavit.

Williams' whereabouts were unknown until late Monday when the Department of Justice reported she had been taken into custody in Pennsylvania.

""It appears that WILLIAMS has fled,"" according to the document, and ""sometime after January 6, 2021, WILLIAMS changed her telephone number and deleted what I believe were her social media accounts on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, Telegram, and Parler.""

Williams' mother told local law enforcement officers in Harrisburg that her daughter packed a bag and left, telling her mother she would be gone for a couple of weeks, but did not provide information about her destination, according to the complaint.

Screengrabs from the ITV video appear in the complaint. In them, Williams appears to be wearing a brown coat and a green shirt.

The complaint also contains links to ITV videos, including one with an interview with a woman identified by ITV as Williams' mother, who describes her daughter as ""empathetic and loving.""

It comes as new images of alleged rioters on the Senate floor surfaced, including Jacob Chansley, who authorities say can be seen wearing a fur-lined hat with horns, standing on the Senate dais where Vice President Mike Pence was sitting before he was evacuated.

Chansley left a chilling note for Pence, according to court documents.

“It’s only a matter of time, justice is coming,"" he wrote, according to court documents. The video appears to show him reading the note aloud.

Chansley has pleaded not guilty and was held pending trial.

In a video from The New Yorker's Luke Mogelson, released over the weekend, rioters and others are seen walking on the floor of the U.S. Senate and suggesting that President Donald Trump wanted them to be there.

In another part, one rioter can be heard saying to Capitol Police officers, ""You are outnumbered! There a f------ million of us there -- and we are listening to Trump -- your boss.""

Jenna Ryan, a Texas real estate agent charged with unlawful entry and disorderly conduct, also claimed she was acting at Trump's direction and wants him to grant her a pardon.

""I do not feel a sense of shame of guilt in my heart from what I was doing. I thought I was following my president. I thought I was following what we were called to do,"" she told local news station KTVT.

mmwgrb	liberal	Trump reportedly had to be talked out of defending Matt Gaetz because the allegations against him were so serious	"Trump had to be talked out of defending Gaetz amid a sex-trafficking scandal, NYT's Maggie Haberman said.

Trump was told to stand down because the allegations were so serious, Haberman told CNN.

After more than a week of silence, Trump released a two-sentence statement defending Gaetz.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Former President Donald Trump had to be talked out of defending Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz after reports surfaced that the Justice Department was investigating whether Gaetz had a sexual relationship with a minor and broke federal sex-trafficking laws.

That's according to The New York Times' Maggie Haberman, who on Thursday told CNN's ""New Day"" that Trump had really wanted to defend the GOP lawmaker, but that he was told to stand down because the allegations against Gaetz were so serious.

""His first impulse was that he wanted to defend Gaetz, you know, 'He's one of our people,'"" Haberman said. ""Several of his advisors had told him that's a very bad idea, that the nature of what Gaetz is being investigated for is so serious that this is not something that former President Trump should be out there on a limb"" for.

Indeed, the silence from Trumpworld was deafening in the days following The Times' revelation about the Gaetz sex probe. Some within the former president's orbit even celebrated the controversy, with one former White House staffer telling Insider last month, ""He's the meanest person in politics.""

Another Trump confidant echoed that assessment, telling Politico, ""The reason you haven't seen people in MAGA world defending Gaetz is less about him being unpopular, which he is in a lot of circles, and more about the fact that he hasn't done a single thing to make people comfortable to defend him.""

The Daily Beast reported on Friday that Trump had stayed quiet on the controversy on the advice of his lawyers. One source told the news website that Trump complained that the situation was ""really bad"" for Gaetz and that the allegations could be part of an attempt to ""smear"" Gaetz, who has long been one of Trump's biggest attack dogs on Capitol Hill.

The lawmaker himself made the same claim, saying that the investigation is part of a convoluted, multimillion dollar extortion scheme against his family. However, the Justice Department's investigation into Gaetz kicked off late last summer and had been well underway by the time Gaetz said the alleged extortion plot started, in early March.

That doesn't necessarily mean his claims are untrue, but it does mean it's unlikely the department's probe was launched as part of any such scheme.

Trump, for his part, released his first public statement about the Gaetz controversy on Wednesday. The statement came after The Times reported that Gaetz had asked Trump, near the end of his presidency, for preemptive pardons for himself and his allies.

Gaetz's office denied the reporting, and Trump's statement also said the GOP lawmaker ""never"" asked for a pardon, adding that ""it must be remembered"" Gaetz denied the allegations against him."	left
gbja4n	liberal	"While Trump minimizes the toll, government orders 100,000 new body bags; Federal coronavirus response documents obtained by NBC News suggest that the president's optimism about ""Opening Up America"" is at odds with dire warnings from inside his administration."	"WASHINGTON — The federal government placed orders for well over 100,000 new body bags to hold victims of COVID-19 in April, according to internal administration documents obtained by NBC News, as well as public records. The biggest set was earmarked for purchase the day after President Donald Trump projected that the U.S. death toll from the coronavirus might not exceed 50,000 or 60,000 people.

That batch is a pending $5.1 million purchase order placed by the Department of Homeland Security on April 21 with E.M. Oil Transport Inc. of Montebello, California, which advertises construction vehicles, building materials and electronics on its website. The ""human remains pouches"" have not been paid for or shipped to the Federal Emergency Management Agency yet, according to the company's marketing manager, Mike Pryor.

""I hope to God that they don't need my order and that they cancel it,"" Pryor said in a text message exchange with NBC News.

Body bag contracts bid by Homeland Security and the Veterans Affairs Department are just one illustration of how Trump's sunny confidence about the nation's readiness to reopen is in conflict with the views of officials in his own administration who are quietly preparing for a far worse outcome.

Around the same time it wrote the contract for the body bags, FEMA opened up bidding to provide about 200 rented refrigerated trailers for locations around the country. The request for proposals specifies a preference for 53-foot trailers, which, at 3,600 cubic feet, are the largest in their class.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

The cache of internal documents obtained by NBC News includes an April 25 ""pre-decisional draft"" of the coronavirus task force's ""incident outlook"" for the response, a summary of the task force leaders' meeting the same day and various communications among officials at several agencies. The documents show that task force members remain worried about several major risks ahead, including insufficient availability of coronavirus tests, the absence of a vaccine or proven treatments for the coronavirus, and the possibility of a ""catastrophic resurgence"" of COVID-19.

When asked in the past about the contrast between his assessments and those of senior officials on his task force, Trump has described his role as ""cheerleader"" for the country. ""I want to give people in this country hope,"" he said in March.

The president has also said testing ""is not going to be a problem at all."" But officials from FEMA and the Department of Health and Human Services clearly disagree. They flagged concerns with the testing plan in the draft of the incident outlook report, which was circulated to task force members along with a summary of the meeting.

The list of testing problems includes: ""Limited number of diagnostic supplies. Limited capacity of test facilities. Limited trained response personnel to administer the tests. Unknown epidemiological information regarding COVID-19. Access to testing sites by underserved areas and at risk populations. Effective vaccines and therapeutics will not be available in sufficient quantities to meet the need. PPE is required by [medical countermeasures] developers and manufacturers.""

Task force officials raised those possibilities as they developed the ""incident outlook"" two days before Trump unveiled his ""Reopening America Again"" plan Monday. That strategy is designed to hand off more responsibility for the response to governors and local officials.

The documents show that the White House and its coronavirus task force are making a quick transition toward an advisory role in public health decisions made by states while maintaining the power to acquire goods and allocate them. Simultaneously, the administration is preparing for many more casualties.

The body bag order, confirmed by internal administration communications obtained by NBC News, is in addition to shipments of several thousand more body bags from vendors for the General Services Administration and the Defense Logistics Agency.

The VA, meanwhile, paid the supply distributor ISO Group $293,780 for an unknown number of body bags to be fully delivered Thursday. The contract states that the purchase is ""in response to COVID-19."" ISO notes on its website that the federal government has awarded eight contracts for that specific body bag in the past 90 days for a total of $12.1 million.

The VA and ISO did not respond to NBC News' inquiries about the contracts. A senior White House official declined to comment on the body bags.

Sam Imbriale, a senior aide at Health and Human Services, told members of the federal response team over the weekend that all resource request forms used by state, local and private-sector officials to seek federal supplies and other assistance must now be routed to the White House, according to a person who heard his remark to dozens of people on a phone conference.

NBC News' request to HHS for an interview with Imbriale was routed to FEMA's media relations team, which did not respond, and the senior White House official did not reply to a question about the remark.

The senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump is taking into account the dangers associated with loosening stay-at-home restrictions and is following the advice of the coronavirus response coordinator, Dr. Deborah Birx, and other doctors on his task force in moving forward.

""At each of the three phases, they make recommendations for what needs to be done to safely begin reopening, while keeping in place mitigation efforts like social distancing,"" the official said in an email. ""Dr. Birx, for example, has been in consultation with states, on behalf of the White House, to advise if they are ready to move toward reopening based on a number of factors, one of which is testing capacity.""

Trump and his top advisers have long said more widespread testing is the predicate for resuming commercial activities paused by efforts to prevent the spread of the disease.

""We want to reopen, and the testing is not going to be a problem at all,"" he declared Monday, adding later that ""the fact that people aren't allowed to have their freedom causes a tremendous amount of problems, including death.""

The White House official said the federal government is ""ramping up"" testing capacity rather than ""slowing down"" and noted a new deal with the Maine-based company Puritan to produce an additional 40 million testing swabs. The administration says 5 million tests have been administered so far — a number equal to about 1.5 percent of the national population — and that the goal for states to be ready to reopen is the ability to test 2 percent of their populations per month.

The push to kick-start an economy that is hemorrhaging workers as it shrinks has drawn little public criticism from within the administration, even as many health experts say loosening stay-at-home rules could greatly increase the number of casualties from a pandemic that has already claimed more than 62,000 lives. But similar concerns were flagged in the preliminary version of the document supporting his strategy that was developed by sub-units of the coronavirus task force made up of employees of FEMA, the Defense Department, HHS and other federal agencies.

The interagency teams concluded that governors, mayors, community leaders and individual Americans may resist Trump's pressure precisely because they believe it will lead to more death.

""Late indicators and human decision making may delay mitigation to prevent catastrophic resurgence,"" the ""incident outlook"" report developed by FEMA and HHS says in a subsection titled ""risks/limiting factors"" for the objective of ""minimizing transmission & risks to public health.""

The other listed reasons demonstrate federal officials' fears that reversing stay-at-home rules and social distancing guidelines could have fatal consequences.

""States may not be following the recommended 'gating' process to make community mitigation adjustments,"" the document says. ""Individual mitigation measures (e.g. hand washing) are often easy to support, but stricter community mitigation measures (e.g. social distancing) can be disruptive making them difficult to sustain. Individuals travelling from high impact areas to low impact areas may have contracted COVID-19 but are asymptomatic. Mitigation fatigue. Community mitigation measures may not have the desired impact. Insufficient [state and local] staff to implement moderate mitigation measures.""

The president is aware of the worries and shares concerns about the potential for a resurgence, the White House official said.

""Our guidelines are based on strong public health science and have been vetted through the interagency,"" the official said. ""But we also understand the novel nature of this virus and that nothing is foolproof. We are encouraging extensive mitigation efforts in the public space to ensure health and safety.""

Some of Trump's advisers have put more emphasis on health risks and less on immediate economic peril. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Tuesday that there could be ""a bad fall"" if states and cities reopen too early.

""If by that time we have put into place all of the countermeasures that you need to address this, we should do reasonably well,"" Fauci said in remarks to the Economic Club of Washington, D.C. ""If we don't do that successfully, we could be in for a bad fall and a bad winter.""

The April 25 meeting was attended by, among others, FEMA Director Pete Gaynor; Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary of health and human services for health; Rear Adm. John Polowczyk, vice director for logistics of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who is the supply-chain lead for the coronavirus task force; and staff from the White House's National Security Council. The NSC staff members dialed in by videoconference, according to the summary of the session.

The preliminary incident outlook draft also laid out challenges to stabilizing the medical supply chain and health care systems — including the risk of disasters on top of the COVID-19 crisis — as Trump tries to reduce the federal role in the response and put more responsibility on state and local governments.

""Food/water or other large commodity mission resulting from an additional disaster declaration would reduce response capabilities for COVID-19,"" the document says.

The resiliency of the U.S. health care system faces hurdles, too, according to the incident outlook draft.

""Additional disasters may further stress the healthcare system,"" the document says. ""Lack of [personal protective equipment] will decrease effectiveness of proposed strategies. Essential pharmaceutical supply shortages. Infection rate and absenteeism of workforce. Non-pharmaceutical interventions may not have the desired impact.""

The primary complication for communications during the period of transition to more localized control of the response, according to the incident outlook report, is ""lack of trust in government messaging.""

lay50g	liberal	Opinion | The Economy Does Much Better Under Democrats. Why?	"What, then, are the most plausible theories?

First, it’s worth rejecting a few unlikely possibilities. Congressional control is not the answer. The pattern holds regardless of which party is running Congress. Deficit spending also doesn’t explain the gap: It is not the case that Democrats juice the economy by spending money and then leave Republicans to clean up the mess. Over the last four decades, in fact, Republican presidents have run up larger deficits than Democrats.

That leaves one broad possibility with a good amount of supporting evidence: Democrats have been more willing to heed economic and historical lessons about what policies actually strengthen the economy, while Republicans have often clung to theories that they want to believe — like the supposedly magical power of tax cuts and deregulation. Democrats, in short, have been more pragmatic.

When Franklin D. Roosevelt first ran for president, in 1932, he did not have a fully coherent economic plan. He sometimes argued that reducing the deficit was the key to ending the Depression. Above all, though, he called for “bold, persistent experimentation.” As he explained: “Take a method and try it: If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something.”

Over time, he and his advisers came to champion the ideas of John Maynard Keynes. In an economic downturn, when companies and households are caught in a vicious cycle of spending reductions, the government needs to step in. The Keynesian approach has shaped Democratic economic policy ever since.

It has made Democratic presidents much more aggressive in responding to crises than Republicans. Not only was Mr. Hoover passive in the face of the Depression, but the first George Bush was slow to fight the 1990-91 recession, and the second George Bush was slow to begin fighting the 2007-9 financial crisis. Mr. Obama and now President Biden, when faced with an economic crisis, have been much bolder.

Michael Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, told me that he believed the overall partisan pattern was mostly coincidence. But, he said, “It is certainly a defensible posture that in periods of economic distress Democrats are more concerned about jobs than Republicans.”

The past year has offered another case study. Mr. Trump repeatedly downplayed the coronavirus pandemic, and the country suffered. The economy would have experienced a downturn no matter who was president, but his scattered response aggravated the pandemic and the recession. In some other countries, life is much closer to normal. In the United States, Mr. Trump became the first president since Mr. Hoover to preside over a decline in employment."	left
kpzpzh	liberal	Carl Bernstein says Trump’s Georgia call is far worse than Nixon’s Watergate	"The leaked tapes of Donald Trump trying to pressure Georgia’s secretary of state to overturn the president’s election defeat are “far worse” than what occurred in the Watergate scandal, journalist Carl Bernstein said Sunday.

Bernstein, whose reporting of the 1972 political scandal led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon, said the bombshell tapes of Trump were evidence of an attempted coup.

“It’s not déjà vu. This was something far worse than occurred in Watergate,” Bernstein told CNN. “We have both a criminal president of the United States in Donald Trump and a subversive president of the United States at the same time in this one person.”

In audio recordings published by The Washington Post Sunday, Trump urged Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” exactly enough votes to overturn his loss in that state to President-elect Joe Biden in the Nov. 3 election. Trump repeatedly insisted he had won. At one point, Trump seemed to threaten legal consequences if Raffensperger did not investigate his baseless claims.

“This is the ultimate smoking gun tape,” Bernstein said. “It is the tape with the evidence of what this president is willing to do to undermine the electoral system and illegally, improperly and immorally try to instigate a coup.”"	left

khv855	liberal	Republican lawmakers who downplayed coronavirus concerns face backlash over early vaccinations	"(CNN) A slate of GOP lawmakers who downplayed different concerns about the coronavirus pandemic or ignored public health advice are now facing a wave of backlash for being among the first to receive a vaccine.

With only limited doses available across the US, members of Congress have been prioritized for inoculation in an effort to maintain governmental continuity on Capitol Hill. But some GOP lawmakers who have publicized their shots -- something public health experts have recommended to advertise the vaccine's safety -- are fielding fierce disapproval given their past comments downplaying or misrepresenting the virus earlier this year.

This includes Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, who tweeted Sunday that she had ""received the first dose of the #COVID19 vaccine"" at the recommendation of the Office of the Attending Physician.

""I encourage all Iowans and Americans to do the same when their time comes,"" she said. ""Thanks to #OperationWarpSpeed and the tireless work of Americans across the country, we are one step closer to defeating this virus.""

But her early vaccination drew swift condemnation on social media, with many pointing to comments she had made in September during her successful reelection campaign suggesting that health care workers were inflating Covid-19 death numbers for profit.

One viral tweet from Sawyer Hackett, a senior adviser to former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, placed Ernst's false comments under the caption ""How it started"" alongside her photo receiving the vaccine under the caption ""how it's going.""

How it started: How it's going: pic.twitter.com/9yFXKyYNuR — Sawyer Hackett (@SawyerHackett) December 21, 2020

The backlash underscores a larger rift unfolding in Congress about when to receive the vaccine. Some lawmakers in recent days have vowed to wait to get vaccinated until vulnerable groups in the US have a chance to get vaccinated as well.

Hawaii Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard tweeted earlier Monday, ""I had planned to get the vaccine but will now stand in solidarity with our seniors by not doing so until THEY can. I urge my colleagues who are under 65 and healthy to join me.""

She joins Reps. Brian Mast, a Florida Republican, Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, and Rep.-elect Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican, who have all said they are waiting to get vaccinated until other essential Americans have access.

Their message follows a memo from the Capitol attending physician that said there was a ""small vaccine supply"" available to Congress.

""Once we have completed the vaccination of the Members, we will follow a process to identify the continuity-essential staff members in the various divisions of the Capitol community in the coming weeks,"" the memo said. ""The appointing process will then continue until the small vaccine supply is exhausted. A second dose scheduling process will then begin later.""

Some public health experts have stressed the importance of top elected officials receiving the vaccine as a way to relay its safety to the American people. High-profile lawmakers in both parties, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have all received the vaccine in recent days while advertising it as a safe way to help end the pandemic.

And many in Congress are considered vulnerable for Covid-19 complications because of their advanced ages.

Most Americans, however, won't have access for months. While the US Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authorization to two vaccines, it's clear there will not be enough for everyone who wants a vaccination right away.

Vaccine advisers have already broken down priority groups into subgroups, and have designated only the very, very first people to get vaccines. Those in this 1a group designated by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices include front-line health care workers and people in long-term care homes.

The limited supply for those priority groups has helped fuel the scrutiny aimed at some of the GOP lawmakers who have received the vaccine.

Like Ernst, Sen. Lindsey Graham -- a close ally of President Donald Trump who has often echoed the President's misleading coronavirus messages -- has faced considerable condemnation.

""Thank God for nurses who help people in need and know how to use a needle,"" the South Carolina Republican tweeted on Saturday alongside a photo of himself receiving the vaccine.

""Thank God for those who produced these vaccines,"" he continued. ""If enough of us take it, we will get back to normal lives. Help is on the way.""

Graham has consistently defended Trump's coronavirus response and a South Carolina US Senate debate in October was forced to change formats after Graham rejected his opponent's request to take an additional Covid-19 test after he had attended a hearing with a lawmaker who later tested positive.

As a result, news of his vaccination garnered thousands of critical responses, many from people who say they work in health care and haven't been able to get a vaccine yet.

Sen. Marco Rubio fielded particularly sharp rebukes after tweeting a photo of himself getting the vaccine and noting that he is ""so confident"" in it that he ""decided to take it myself."" The Florida Republican, who is 49 years old, spoke at a largely maskless rally for the Georgia US Senate contests last month.

CNN political commentator Ana Navarro took particular issue with Rubio joking on Twitter that he ""looked away from the needle"" and knows that he needs ""a tan.""

""Something that really pissed me off -- triggered me of that post, was, you know, he started by making a joke about how he looked away from the needle and how he needed a tan in his arm. You've got privilege that others don't. You are getting a precious vaccine that millions are waiting for,"" she told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on ""Newsroom.""

""There's people risking their lives on a daily basis that are not getting that vaccine yet, and you crack a joke about your pasty white arm? Really?""

CNN has contacted the offices of Ernst and Graham for comment. After this story was published, Rubio on Twitter pointed to a statement he made in June when he said ""everyone should just wear a damn mask"" and suggested that him taking the vaccine would encourage others to do the same.

President-elect Joe Biden received his first dose of the Pfizer and BioNTech coronavirus vaccine on live television Monday afternoon and reassured Americans of the vaccine's safety.

""We owe these folks an awful lot,"" Biden said, thanking those involved in the vaccine's development and distribution and front-line health care workers.

While Vice President Mike Pence also publicly received the vaccine, a White House official told CNN earlier this month that it won't be administered to Trump until it's recommended by the White House medical team.

The official said Trump is still receiving the benefits of the monoclonal antibody cocktail he was given during his recovery from Covid-19 in the fall.

This story has been updated to include comment from Rubio."	left
hfp0ul	liberal	Trump’s ban on temporary work visas is an attempt to scapegoat immigrants during an economic collapse: Real reform would improve wages and working conditions	"President Trump has issued a new proclamation, “Suspending Entry of Aliens Who Present a Risk to the U.S. Labor Market Following the Coronavirus Outbreak,” that will halt the issuance of certain major categories of nonimmigrant (i.e., temporary) work visas until the end of 2020, and calls for a number of rule changes with respect to work visas and work authorization. (A presidential proclamation is essentially the same as an executive order.) This follows his April proclamation that would suspend a third of immigrant visas from being issued (immigrant visas are also known as “green cards,” which confer foreign residents with lawful permanent resident status that can eventually lead to citizenship). The language in the April proclamation, which was initially valid for 60 days, also directed federal agencies to examine nonimmigrant work visas; this new proclamation appears to be the result of that effort. Trump’s new proclamation extends the duration of the April proclamation banning certain green cards until the end of 2020.

Trump’s June 2020 proclamation will suspend the issuance of new temporary work visas to migrants and their family members if they are applying from abroad, between now and December 31, 2020, but does not appear to suspend the issuance of visa statuses for those applying from within the United States. The impacted visa classifications are the H-1B for occupations requiring a college degree, H-2B for low-wage jobs outside of agriculture, L-1 for intracompany transferees and personnel with specialized knowledge, and some of the major programs that authorize employment in the J-1 Exchange Visitor Program, specifically the J-1 Intern, Trainee, Teacher, Camp Counselor, Au Pair, and Summer Work Travel programs.

While most of these visa classifications are issued to applicants at consulates abroad and are therefore suspended, the H-1B is an exception. In 2019, 60% of new H-1Bs were issued to migrants who were already present in the United States, often on a student visa. Therefore, the H-1B program will be less impacted in terms of a reduction in visas. (It may even result in a higher share of foreign graduates of U.S. universities being granted H-1B status, since they’ll be applying from within the country.)

The proclamation contains exceptions for migrant workers whose work will support the food supply chain or serve the national interest by being either critical to defense, law enforcement, diplomacy, or national security; if they’re involved with the provision of COVID-19 medical care or research; or if their work is otherwise necessary to facilitate the economic recovery of the United States.

In addition, the proclamation calls for the Department of Labor (DOL) to promulgate rules to ensure that current migrant workers in the country with EB-2 or EB-3 green cards, or current H-1B visa holders, do not disadvantage U.S. workers—though it did not provide specific information on what they’re considering in that regard. The proclamation also calls on the State Department and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to collect additional biometric information from visa applicants; it prohibits DHS from issuing employment authorization documents to migrants in the United States if they are subject to a final order of removal or if they’ve been convicted of a criminal offense; and it directs DHS to consider promulgating regulations on H-1B that would result in an “efficient allocation” of visas, which likely means prioritizing the issuance of visas by the highest wage offers, as some government officials have recently hinted at. (A very similar order on the allocation of H-1B visas was issued in section 5(b) of Trump’s Buy American, Hire American [BAHA] executive order in 2017, but has yet to be acted upon.)

There’s no denying that work visa programs desperately need to be reformed in order to be fairer to the 1.6 million temporary migrant workers who are currently employed with nonimmigrant visas, and to U.S. workers. There’s plenty of evidence that temporary migrant workers can be legally underpaid and are often exploited, in part because their visas are almost always tied to one employer who owns and controls their status. That visa status is what determines the worker’s right to remain in the country; if they lose their job, they lose their visa and become deportable. Visa program rules also make it easy for employers to avoid hiring U.S. workers in favor of temporary migrants, and even replace them. There is very little oversight of temporary work visa programs; in fact, most of the programs have no rules in place at all to protect migrants after they arrive in the United States, and in the programs that have rules, there’s little enforcement, and frequent and extreme violators of these rules are often allowed to continue hiring. And most temporary migrant workers—despite the contributions they make—never have a chance to become permanent residents or naturalized citizens.

Nevertheless, temporary work visas are one of the few existing pathways for migrants to contribute to the United States economically, socially, and culturally—which is why every administration should prioritize reforming visa programs in ways that uplift labor standards for all and ensure migrants are paid and treated fairly, and allow them to have a chance to quickly adjust to permanent resident status. But is this proclamation an honest attempt to fix U.S. temporary work visa programs? Undoubtedly, the answer is no.

Instead of offering thoughtful reforms, it slaps a blanket ban on a handful of visa programs. And it does so during a time when almost no temporary visas are being issued. In case the administration hasn’t noticed, the immigration system is already shut down, almost entirely, as a result of the pandemic, except for temporary migrant workers employed in agriculture with H-2A visas, which are not mentioned in the proclamation. We have yet to see any signs of when regular visa processing will resume at consulates abroad. Considering the number of new coronavirus infections continues to increase rapidly in the United States and abroad, it’s difficult to imagine the immigration system opening back up anytime soon. Would any of the banned visas have been issued in these programs before the end of the year absent this proclamation? I’m not convinced they would have, and at least one prominent immigration lawyer also holds that view.

Even before taking office, Trump was claiming he would fix temporary work visa programs, noting in an address as president-elect that he would direct DOL to investigate visa abuses. Trump later issued the BAHA Executive Order in 2017, which called on federal agencies to improve the H-1B visa program. But so far, nothing of substance has been done to raise wages for temporary migrant workers in visa programs, or to improve conditions for the U.S. workers that are employed alongside them in similar jobs. Instead—despite the absence of new rules or worker protections—before the pandemic, the number of visas issued in the programs where most abuses occur was actually increasing.

There are also no long-term, meaningful changes proposed to fix the H-1B or H-2B visa programs. None are proposed either for the J-1 or L-1 visa programs, or the Optional Practical training program, all of which have no wage rules, no annual numerical limits (except for J-1 Summer Work Travel), and no oversight or enforcement by DOL to protect labor standards. Many of the solutions are simple and enjoy bipartisan support, but it doesn’t appear that the Trump administration is engaging seriously with those ideas. For example, a real and meaningful reform of the H-1B and L-1 visa programs would require enacting the bipartisan H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act, which was recently reintroduced in the House and Senate by a bipartisan group of legislators, but Trump has never indicated if he supports the bill.

In light of all this, the new proclamation looks to be mostly symbolic and is likely a political tactic to blame immigrants for high unemployment, despite the fact that they had nothing to do with causing it. The economy has lost more than 30 million jobs because of the pandemic and federal lawmakers’ failure to provide adequate support to keep workers on payrolls, failure to provide aid to state and local governments whose tax revenues have plummeted, and failure to implement public health measures that would allow the economy to reopen successfully. The proclamation is ultimately a distraction from the real problems in our economy and a blatant attempt to divide working people based on race and status.

Since he didn’t try to reform work visa programs during the first three-and-a-half years of his administration, there’s good reason to be skeptical that Trump will suddenly decide to improve conditions for workers with just five months left before the general election. The fact that on the same day as the proclamation, DHS posted the text of a final regulation that will make it nearly impossible for asylum-seekers to be able to work lawfully while their claims of persecution are adjudicated, which can take years—forcing them to either starve and become homeless or work unlawfully in order to survive—should tell you all you need to know about how little Trump cares about workers and labor standards.

Furthermore, Trump’s DOL has been MIA during the pandemic by failing to issue an Emergency Temporary Standard for workplace safety or take any significant enforcement actions to protect workers—including in industries like agriculture where hundreds of thousands of temporary migrant workers are employed, or in meatpacking plants where 40% of workers are immigrants. DOL’s absence has been so conspicuous that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is being investigated for it.

In sum, the practical impact of Trump’s proclamation on temporary work visas appears to be minimal—for now. But the ultimate message inherent in Trump’s two immigration proclamations on green cards and temporary work visas has been communicated loud and clear: Immigrants can and will be used as scapegoats to distract from the administration’s failings."	left
heshq8	liberal	Texas hits all-time high for COVID-19 cases; governor urges residents to stay home	"Texas hits all-time high for COVID-19 cases; governor urges residents to stay home

Show Caption Hide Caption Governor: Enough beds for Texas virus patients Texas Gov. Greg Abbott says a rise in coronavirus hospitalizations in his state ""does raise concerns"" but he adds the state currently has enough hospital beds to handle it. (June 16) AP

Texas is hitting an all-time high for COVID-19 cases, and Gov. Greg Abbott told state residents to stay home unless they need to be out.

“Texas will report an all-time high in the number of cases of people testing positive of more than 5,000,” Abbott said in an interview on KBTX. “The hospitalization rate is at an all-time high. Coronavirus is spreading in Brazos County and across the entire state of Texas, which is exactly why action is being taken.”

Hours later, state health officials reported a record 5,489 new COVID-19 cases.

And the state broke its record for hospitalizations for the 12th day in a row as the Department of State Health Services reported 4,092 COVID-19 patients in Texas hospitals.

“We want to make sure everyone reinforces the best safe practices of wearing a mask, hand sanitation, maintaining safe distance, but importantly, because the spread is so rapid right now, there’s never a reason for you to have to leave your home unless you need to go out,” Abbott said. “The safest place for you is at your home.”

With mounting intensity, the governor has been sounding the alarm since a briefing Monday on a troubling spike in the pandemic’s spread and his concern that some Texans are not taking the threat seriously enough.

In an interview on KRIS-TV in Corpus Christi, Abbott said: “There still remain some people in Nueces County, as well as in the entire region, who seem to think the COVID-19 is not a challenge. People need to recognize this is a very swift-spreading virus for which there is no cure.”

Abbott was introduced on KRIS with a grim report that Nueces County have “already eclipsed Dallas and San Antonio in the number of new cases per day, per capita.”

Abbott said Monday that reversing the reopening of Texas would be a last resort. “Closing down Texas again will always be the last option,” he said.

But, he said Tuesday, “if we are unable to contain the spiraling spread of COVID-19, there will be more requirements put on businesses, including even considering have to ratchet back on the expansion of opening businesses in Texas.”

“That’s the last thing that either I or those businesses want to do,” he said. “So the best thing that we can all do is work on continuing to open up businesses but do so in ways that use safe practices that include wearing a mask.”

Texas Democrats, who have been warning this day would come, greeted the governor’s new tone with a “we told you so.”

“The record-breaking number of COVID-19 cases today and the fact that Texas has seen 12 straight days of record hospitalizations is because of Greg Abbott’s failure to lead,” said Texas Democratic Party Communications Director Abhi Rahman. “Texans are suffering. Our sacrifices might be for nothing. From Day One of this crisis, Abbott has undermined, hid and outright refused to listen to science or doctors. We’re seeing the catastrophic results of his failures.”

The percentage of tests that come back positive has also continued to increase. The state’s seven-day rolling average rate of positive cases reached nearly 10% on Monday, according to state health officials.

The rolling rate is calculated by taking a week’s worth of new COVID-19 cases and dividing it by the total tests performed in those seven days.

Public health experts say that number should ideally stay below 6%, and Abbott has said a positivity rate above 10% would be cause for alarm.

State health officials also reported 23 new coronavirus-related deaths Tuesday, bringing the statewide total to 2,220.

More than 70,000 people have recovered from the virus, a number the health agency says is an estimate based on “several assumptions related to hospitalization rates and recovery times.” Recovery statistics are not a factor that indicate a state’s readiness to reopen, according to guidelines from the White House.

After health officials reported Tuesday’s COVID-19 totals, Abbott issued a proclamation to expand local authority on outdoor gatherings and directed the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to provide strict health and safety standards for child care centers.

Under Abbott’s updated order, local governments have the power to impose restrictions on gatherings with more than 100 people.

Previously, local officials could impose restrictions on outdoor gatherings of more than 500 people."	left
lmdwba	liberal	Rick Perry says Texans would choose to be without power for longer ‘to keep government out of their business’	"Former Texas Governor Rick Perry said that Texans would rather continue to freeze in their homes without electricity than to allow the federal government more involvement in the state's energy grid.

“Texans would be without electricity for longer than three days to keep the federal government out of their business,” Mr Perry said on a blog on House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's website.

Mr McCarthy said the comment was ""partially rhetorical.""

The comment comes as millions of Texans are without power during an unprecedented winter storm dropping temperatures to single digits.

Mr McCarthy said that the catastrophic failure of Texas's privatised electric grid would be seized upon by liberals, as an “opportunity to expand their top-down, radical proposals.”

The majority of Texas's power grid is managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which does not cross state lines and is not subject to federal regulations.

Conservatives have tried to blame the power outages across the state on wind turbines that have frozen, but critics of that argument have pointed out that wind turbines are frequently used in cold-weather climates - including Antarctica - without issue, and that natural gas pipelines - which powers more than half the state - have frozen.

Experts have blamed a lack of investment by power plant operators into their equipment for the widespread failure of the state's infrastructure.

They argue that the lack of profit incentive for preparing the plants for winters made the infrastructure vulnerable.

""It's Wild West market design based only on short-run prices,” said Matt Breidert, a portfolio manager at a firm called Ecofin, told The Washington Post.

Edward Hirs, an energy fellow at the University of Houston, likened the failure to the waning days of the Soviet Union.

“They hate it when I say that,” he said.

On Tuesday, Governor Greg Abbott called for an investigation into ERCOT's failure.

“Far too many Texans are without power and heat for their homes as our state faces freezing temperatures and severe winter weather,” he said in a statement. “This is unacceptable.”

More than 20 people have died as a result of the winter storm ripping through the state.

A second winter storm is expected to move through the region on Wednesday.

ERCOT CEO Bill Magness said the company was not prepared to offer a definitive time frame for when power was expected to return to the still 2.7m people without power in the state.

Mr Magness said if rolling outages had not been implemented, the outages could have lasted for months."	left
l9ucli	liberal	Anti-vax ‘mob’ that closed Dodger Stadium vaccination site sparks outrage	"After a group of protesters managed to disrupt operations at Dodger Stadium’s mass COVID-19 vaccination site Saturday, some Los Angeles officials expressed fury at the demonstrators while calling for increased security at testing and vaccination installations.

Los Angeles Fire Department officials closed the main entrance to the stadium — one of the largest vaccination sites in the country — for about an hour Saturday after 40 to 60 demonstrators appeared on Stadium Way holding signs that decried masks while shouting unfounded claims about the dangers of the vaccine.

The group dispersed around 3 p.m., and there were no arrests or injuries reported, said LAFD Assistant Chief Ellsworth Fortman, who oversees the department’s COVID-19 response. Fortman said approximately 5,740 doses of the vaccine were issued Saturday at the site, which distributes 5,700 to 7,700 doses daily. Workers were still vaccinating people inside the stadium during the hour that the main entrance was closed, he said.

Both fire and police officials have said that the group was nonviolent and that the decision to close the entrance to the facility was a precaution. The protest left several city leaders infuriated, with some questioning why police weren’t more aggressive toward demonstrators, contending the LAPD has been more proactive in quashing anti-police or Black Lives Matter protests.

“Look, the world sees this. What it does is it undermines our public safety community. It’s not good for our public safety community for people to believe that there’s inequitable treatment,” said L.A. City Councilman Gil Cedillo, whose district includes Dodger Stadium. “That does not help them do their job. When some people get coddled and others don’t.”

The protest came as frustrations over state and county officials’ handling of the virus remain high. The number of coronavirus deaths in California surpassed 40,000 on Friday. More than half those fatalities have occurred since Nov. 1, part of a startling surge in the lethality of the virus, amid concerns that more dangerous strains are emerging.

At the same time, business owners who are struggling to keep their lights on have repeatedly called for the relaxation of rules limiting dining and other gatherings.

Fortman said the decision to close the gate was made after protesters approached the Stadium Way entrance out of concerns for the safety of workers inside and the protesters themselves, who he said could have been struck by cars as they marched through the site.

After 45 minutes, Fortman said, LAPD officers approached the group and warned them they could face citation or arrest if they entered the vaccination site and ordered them to get out of the street.

The group complied and largely dispersed by 3 p.m., Fortman said. The protesters’ actions ultimately did little to inhibit vaccine distribution, he said.

“At the end of the day, it didn’t really impact much,” he said. “I feel bad for those folks [who] ended up waiting an additional 50 minutes.”

It was unclear how many people left the line to enter the site and missed their appointment during the nearly hourlong closure, but long lines have already proved to be a major deterrent for elderly Angelenos seeking the vaccine.

Some expressed concern online Saturday that their grandparents had probably given up trying to get vaccinated Saturday due to the protest.

Despite the fact that the protesters’ actions led fire officials to close the stadium’s entrance, police said there would have been no reason to declare an unlawful assembly or order arrests Saturday.

Officer Mike Lopez, an LAPD spokesman, said the protesters complied with orders to stay out of the street and did not violate any other laws or ordinances while outside Dodger Stadium.

Andrea Garcia, a spokeswoman for Mayor Eric Garcetti, said the city is “reviewing vaccine site safety protocol” after the incident and will establish designated spaces for protesters should demonstrations be staged at vaccination sites in the future.

Although it is not clear who organized the protest, fliers promoting the event were shared online by the group Shop Mask Free Los Angeles, whose members have repeatedly shown up at supermarkets and stores in recent months and attempted to purchase items without masks.

The events usually end in arguments between the group’s members and store employees, and sometimes draw law enforcement responses, according to videos the group has published online.

The LAPD has responded to several incidents involving the group, normally bringing peaceful ends to their demonstrations but rarely issuing citations despite the group’s obvious repeated violations of city and county health ordinances that mandate the wearing of masks.

Los Angeles police did arrest one member of the group during an incident Jan. 20, according to city officials, but Lopez could not immediately provide information about that incident or other contacts between the LAPD and those demonstrators.

Cedillo said he was especially furious that the demonstration took place in his district, which has been hit hard by the virus. In recent weeks, Cedillo’s office has posted multilingual signs in parts of Westlake, Lincoln Heights, Highland Park and Koreatown warning people they were entering a “high-risk area” for COVID-19, and he also said he’s sent staff members to knock on doors to provide information about vaccinations to senior residents.

Cedillo’s district includes several neighborhoods that are predominantly working-class and Latino, two groups that have been disproportionately affected by the virus. The number of Latinos in L.A. County who are dying from the virus on a daily basis has surged in recent weeks.

“This mob feels they have a right to try to stop people like seniors, janitors, housekeepers, restaurant workers and supermarket workers from getting the vaccine that they covet. That they want,” Cedillo said. “It’s just very offensive. Very arrogant. It’s an incredible sense of entitlement.”"	left
h8fpio	liberal	You Don’t Have to Publish Both Sides When One Side Is Fascism	"The Trump administration and its Republican enablers are fighting a series of wars directed at targets inside the United States. A partial list would include immigrants, African Americans, Jews, poor people, middle-class people, people with student loan debts, the environment, voting rights, fair elections, blue-state taxpayers, the rule of law, honest elections, and all forms of accountability for Donald Trump, his family, and the criminals who helped him get elected. Because these are by and large unpopular causes, and it is the job of the press to let the public know what is going on, journalists are also a necessary, if ancillary, target. That explains Trump’s frequent use of the phrase “enemies of the people,” which had been the go-to charge of dictators and mass murderers, as well as his incessantly parroted mantra “fake news.”

Those running the country’s elite media institutions have no experience with a situation like this and still cannot figure out how to handle it. Historically, media machers have seen themselves as collaborators with government officials to ensure that things run smoothly for whoever is in power. They do this, in part, because they believe in the cause and, in part, to obtain access, quotes, and the public pretense of respect. When James Reston, who was then The New York Times’ most influential columnist, published an op-ed in 1979 titled “By Henry Kissinger With James Reston,” he did so not with shame but pride.

Reston was flacking for a man who directed a secret, unconstitutional war in Cambodia and Laos and illegally wiretapped journalists and the members of his own staff to determine who leaked the news to Reston’s paper. US government officials, especially but not exclusively Republicans, have been lying to the American people about matters of life and death for a long time. The mainstream media eventually righted itself under President Richard Nixon’s assault on our democratic institutions, but its ability to do so today under Trump, an even greater threat to American democracy, is considerably diminished. The reasons for this are complex. Some are economic, others technological. But during the present crisis, the biggest problem is that the leaders of the mainstream media cannot make up their minds about the fundamental question of the Trump presidency: “Which side are you on?”

The top editors of almost all of America’s mainstream media institutions have explicitly rejected the notion of a journalism of opposition. While The New York Times and The Washington Post, for instance, have tallied Trump’s untruths—separate from the articles in which they are repeated verbatim—neither has proved willing to reconsider its commitment to the mindless both-sides style of reporting in which Republican lies and incitements to fascist violence are given equal weight to Democratic attempts to tell the truth and defend democracy.

Thanks to Trump’s response to the protests against police brutality, however, the jig is up. Military leaders past and present and even a few Republicans have had enough. It is not OK for Trump to demand a military attack on our own citizens and then lie about having done so. And yet at this moment, New York Times opinion editors offered American journalism’s most prestigious real estate to Senator Tom Cotton to make the case for Trump’s proposed assault. MORE FROM Eric Alterman Yes, Israel Is Obviously an Apartheid State Today 5:30 am The Remarkable Influence of Walter LaFeber March 17, 2021 Even in Death, Sheldon Adelson Will Keep Undermining Democracy February 8, 2021 Author page

The best case that could be made for the Cotton op-ed was its obvious crappiness. The piece was nothing but lies, half-truths, character assassination, and scare tactics. Anyone reading with a critical eye would have recognized his argument’s weakness and dismissed it as deranged fascist propaganda. Had the Times defended its decision to publish the piece by explaining it was purely to expose the shoddiness of the Trump team’s argument, it would have been a defensible position based on a degree of respect for the intelligence of its readership. This is presumably the reason Russian President Vladimir Putin and Taliban deputy Sirajuddin Haqqani have appeared on the op-ed page as well.

But that is not what happened. The paper’s editorial page editor, James Bennet, followed by its publisher, A.G. Sulzberger, initially justified the piece in terms of the op-ed page’s traditional (and laudable) commitment to diversity of opinion. They acknowledged the piece’s weaknesses only after an unprecedented online rebellion by the paper’s reporters and contributors, led by African American staffers who felt that its publication put their lives in danger. Bennet resigned after admitting that he had not read the piece in advance, and the deputy in charge, James Dao, was reassigned. Given the regular appearances on the page of former Wall Street Journal opinion editors Bret Stephens and Bari Weiss, it’s no wonder that the 25-year-old Adam Rubenstein—also an alumnus of the Journal (and The Weekly Standard)—who edited and shepherded the piece onto the Times’ website despite objections from a photo editor, did not recognize its awfulness or dangerousness. But therein lies the problem. The paper cannot decide which side it’s on.

We know which side Cotton’s on. In addition to calling on Twitter for the military to attack protesters with “no quarter”—that is, committing the war crime of massacring captured troops even if they surrender—he also once urged the Department of Justice to “prosecute [reporters and an editor at the Times] to the fullest extent of the law” for an article revealing a US intelligence program to track the financial activities of suspected terrorist networks. He was for many years a protégé of Weekly Standard founder William Kristol, who, in his previous, pre-woke incarnation, similarly opined, “I think it is an open question whether the Times itself should be prosecuted” for what he termed a “totally gratuitous revealing of an ongoing secret classified program that is part of the war on terror.” Kristol was rewarded for this with a regular spot on the op-ed page.

I don’t doubt the Times editors’ good faith in seeking to expose readers to points of view they might not otherwise encounter. But more than three years into the Trump presidency, given the threats we face, it is long past time for editors to stop playing both sides with fascism and democracy."	left
mtq1s1	liberal	White supremacists drive US domestic terrorist attacks to highest level in 25 years	"Domestic terrorist plots and attacks in the United States have skyrocketed to the highest rates recorded in a quarter-century, according to an analysis by The Washington Post and the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).

CSIS, a nonpartisan nonprofit that specializes in national security issues, has been monitoring extremism since 1994. There have been 267 plots or attacks and 91 fatalities since 2015, most of which came from the far right.

Left-wing extremists made up 66 incidents, which led to 19 deaths.

In 2020 alone, far-right extremists committed 73 domestic terrorist incidents, an all-time high record. In total, CSIS has recorded nearly 1,000 incidents since 1994.

America is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.

Some attacks are harder to decipher, whether it is left or right. However, The Post uses the attackers' court records, social media postings, news accounts and other material from local, state and federal law enforcement authorities to “refine the types of extremism involved in each case,” reporters wrote.

Predominantly Black churches have been attacked and vandalized at least 15 times in the past six years, one of which was the New Shiloh Christian Center in Melbourne, Fla. The church was set on fire three times in early 2015, and there were no suspects.

On the far-left, 25 crimes were committed in 2020, including at least seven incidents targeting the police with guns, firebombs and graffiti.

The Post stated left-leaning crimes were during national protests in response to George Floyd's murder.

“What is most concerning is that the number of domestic terror plots and attacks are at the highest they have been in decades,” CSIS director of the database project Seth Jones said. “It’s so important for Americans to understand the gravity of the threat before it gets worse.”

“January 6 was not an isolated event,” FBI Director Christopher A. Wray told the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 2. “The problem of domestic terrorism has been metastasizing across the country for a long time now and it’s not going away anytime soon.”

m229ns	liberal	Biden’s signature won’t appear on stimulus checks: ‘This is not about him — this is about the American people’	"President Joe Biden’s signature will not appear on the next round of direct economic relief payments sent to Americans across the country, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Tuesday, unlike his predecessor.

While former President Donald Trump reportedly insisted on having his name appear on the stimulus payments sent to taxpayers during his tenure in the Oval Office, Ms Psaki said at her latest press briefing: “This is not about him — this is about the American people getting relief.”

Asked about whether the president had requested his signature on the payments, the press secretary said Mr Biden “didn’t think that was a priority or a necessary step.”

There were allegations that Mr Trump’s reported demands for his signature to appear on the previous checks may have delayed those payments.

The IRS contended that checks went out on time, however, saying in a statement: “Thanks to hard work and long hours by dedicated IRS employees, these payments are going out on schedule, as planned, without delay, to the nation.”

Still, the White House said Mr Biden did not want any interruption in the payments being distributed and indicated his eagerness to sign the American Rescue Plan, a sweeping $1.9 trillion relief bill he proposed upon taking office.

Mr Biden was expected to sign the American Rescue Plan into law after it passed the House, where Democratic caucus chairman Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) said he was confident the party had the votes to approve the bill.

The plan includes the $1,400 direct payments to Americans earning up to $75,000, as well as additional funding for vaccine distribution and to states that have seen budget deficits spurred by the pandemic and resulting economic decline.

Mr Trump was reportedly adamant that his name appear on the stimulus checks, despite the president not maintaining the authority to sign payments sent from the US Treasury. So, he instead had his signature added to the “memo” space.

The Washington Post and other outlets said the request for his signature to be included on the payments did in fact cause a delay in their distribution.

Ms Psaki said on Tuesday the administration was focused on getting the payments sent out as quickly as possible, noting the demand for immediate relief from the nation’s most vulnerable workers and low-income communities, which have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.

“We’re doing everything in our power to expedite the payments and not delay them”, she said."	left

WASHINGTON (AP) — A new executive order from President Joe Biden directs federal agencies to take a series of steps to promote voting access, a move that comes as congressional Democrats press for a sweeping voting and elections bill to counter efforts to restrict voting access .

His plan was announced during a recorded address on the 56th commemoration of “Bloody Sunday,” the 1965 incident in which some 600 civil rights activists were viciously beaten by state troopers as they tried to march for voting rights in Selma, Alabama.

“Every eligible voter should be able to vote and have it counted,” Biden said in his remarks to Sunday’s Martin and Coretta King Unity Breakfast before signing the order. “If you have the best ideas, you have nothing to hide. Let the people vote.”

Biden’s order includes several modest provisions. It directs federal agencies to expand access to voter registration and election information, calls on the heads of agencies to come up with plans to give federal employees time off to vote or volunteer as nonpartisan poll workers, and pushes an overhaul of the government’s Vote.gov website.

Democrats are attempting to solidify support for House Resolution 1, which touches on virtually every aspect of the electoral process. It was approved Wednesday on a near party-line vote, 220-210.

The voting rights bill includes provisions to restrict partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts, strike down hurdles to voting and bring transparency to a murky campaign finance system that allows wealthy donors to anonymously bankroll political causes.

Democrats say the bill will help stifle voter suppression attempts, while Republicans have cast the bill as unwanted federal interference in states’ authority to conduct their own elections.

The bill’s fate is far from certain in the closely divided Senate. Conservative groups have undertaken a $5 million campaign to try persuade moderate Senate Democrats to oppose rule changes needed to pass the measure.

With his executive order, Biden is looking to turn the spotlight on the issue and is using the somber commemoration of Bloody Sunday to make the case that much is at stake.

Bloody Sunday proved to be a turning point in the civil rights movement that led to passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Similarly, Biden is hoping the Jan. 6 sacking of the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Donald Trump mob will prove to be a clarion call for Congress to take action to improve voter protections.

“In 2020 — with our very democracy on the line — even in the midst of a pandemic – more Americans voted than ever before,” Biden said. “Yet instead of celebrating this powerful demonstration of voting — we saw an unprecedented insurrection on our Capitol and a brutal attack on our democracy on January 6th. A never-before-seen effort to ignore, undermine and undo the will of the people.”

Biden’s also paid tribute to the late civil rights giants Rev. C.T. Vivian, Rev. Joseph Lowery and Rep. John Lewis. All played critical roles in the 1965 organizing efforts in Selma and all died in within the past year."	left
go39ub	liberal	Protesters hold 'Trump lies, people die' signs and dump fake body bags outside White House	"Demonstrators dumped fake body bags outside the White House and held up signs that read “Trump Lies, People Die,” in protest at president Donald Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

The demonstration coincided with a separate protest outside the White House on Wednesday that called for the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) to approve the use of therapeutic drugs to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

Demonstrators protesting the coronavirus response laid down fake black body bags, while the ALS protesters laid inside white ones across the street.

Some of the coronavirus protesters held up signs which read “Trump Lies, People Die,” according to Newsweek, for what was called a National Day of Mourning for those who have lost their lives to Covid-19.

One of the co-organisers of the demonstration, CPD Action, tweeted that the protests were part of a mock funeral that put the blame for coronavirus deaths at the door of the Trump administration.

Loading....

“Activists across the country are holding a mass #NationalFuneral to hold the Trump administration and Republican elected officials accountable for their failure to protect people from Covid-19,” the tweet read.

The Trump administration has been widely criticised for its response to the coronavirus crisis, and many believe the government has been too slow to react to the pandemic.

The US now has the highest coronavirus-related death total in the world, and earlier this month Forbes reported that since the start of the outbreak in the US, Mr Trump has lied 23 times per day.

The president has also faced criticism for backtracking on claims he has made during the crisis, and last month falsely told US citizens that injecting bleach could help treat the virus.

This week, six sources from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told CNN that the Trump administration has followed ideology over science in its response.

Recommended National Guard deployments end day before they can claim benefits

A current CDC official told CNN that the organisation planned to put out a global advisory that warned about the dangers of flying abroad, a week before the Trump administration formally recognised it.

If the advisory had been published when the organisation planned, US lives would have been saved, the official added.

“We’ve been muzzled,” the officials said. “What’s tough is that if we would have acted earlier on what we knew and recommended, we would have saved lives and money.”

In the time between their proposal and the publishing of the advisory, more than 66,000 Europeans arrived at US airports.

At the ALS demonstration protesters climbed into white body bags.

Twitter user @LuchaEla posted a picture of the body bag protest and asked for the FDA to approve drugs to treat ALS.

“Do for #ALS what you did for #COVID. #ALS is 100 percent fatal! Help ALS patients access promising treatments NOW! We do not have time to wait!” she tweeted.

According to a tracking project hosted by Johns Hopkins University, there are now more than 1.5 million people who have tested positive for coronavirus in the US. The death toll has reached at least 94,994."	left

PHOENIX (AP) — The lawyer for an Arizona man who took part in the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol while sporting face paint, no shirt and a furry hat with horns is offering to have his client testify at former President Donald Trump’s upcoming impeachment trial.

Lawyer Albert Watkins said he hasn’t spoken to any member in the Senate since announcing his offer to have Jacob Chansley testify at Trump’s trial, which is scheduled to begin the week of Feb. 8. Watkins said it’s important for senators to hear the voice of someone who was incited by Trump.

Watkins said his client was previously “horrendously smitten” by Trump but now feels let down after Trump’s refusal to grant Chansley and others who participated in the insurrection a pardon. “He felt like he was betrayed by the president,” Watkins said.

The words of Trump supporters who are accused of participating in the riot may end up being used against him in the impeachment trial. Chansley and at least four others people who are facing federal charges stemming from the riot have suggested they were taking orders from Trump.

Chansley hasn’t yet entered a plea to charges civil disorder, obstruction of an official proceeding, disorderly conduct in a restricted building, demonstrating in a Capitol building and other counts. He is scheduled to be arraigned Friday in Washington.

In successfully seeking his detention until trial, prosecutors said Chansley went into the Capitol carrying a U.S. flag attached to a wooden pole topped with a spear, ignored an officer’s commands to leave, went into the Senate chamber and wrote a threatening note to then-Vice President Mike Pence.

Chansley, who calls himself the “QAnon Shaman” and has long been a fixture at Trump rallies, told investigators he came to the Capitol “at the request of the president that all ‘patriots’ come to D.C. on January 6,” according to court records."	left

WASHINGTON (AP) — FBI Director Christopher Wray bluntly labeled the January riot at the U.S. Capitol as “domestic terrorism” Tuesday and warned of a rapidly growing threat of homegrown violent extremism that law enforcement is scrambling to confront through thousands of investigations.

Wray also defended to lawmakers his own agency’s handling of an intelligence report that warned of the prospect for violence on Jan. 6. And he firmly rejected false claims advanced by some Republicans that anti-Trump groups had organized the deadly riot that began when a violent mob stormed the building as Congress was gathering to certify results of the presidential election.

Wray’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, his first before Congress since the insurrection, was one in a series of hearings centered on the law enforcement response to the Capitol insurrection. Lawmakers pressed him not only about possible intelligence and communication failures ahead of the riot but also about the threat of violence from white supremacists, militias and other extremists that the FBI says it is prioritizing with the same urgency as the menace of international terrorism organizations.

“Jan. 6 was not an isolated event. The problem of domestic terrorism has been metastasizing across the country for a long time now and it’s not going away anytime soon,” Wray told lawmakers. “At the FBI, we’ve been sounding the alarm on it for a number of years now.”

The violence at the Capitol made clear that a law enforcement agency that remade itself after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to deal with international terrorism is now laboring to address homegrown violence by white Americans. President Joe Biden’s administration has tasked his national intelligence director to work with the FBI and Department of Homeland Security to assess the threat. And in applying the domestic terrorism label to conduct inside the Capitol, Wray sought to make clear to senators that he was clear-eyed about the scope and urgency of the problem.

In quantifying the scale of the FBI’s work, Wray said the number of domestic terrorism investigations has increased from around 1,000 when he became director in 2017 to roughly 1,400 at the end of last year to about 2,000 now. The number of arrests of white supremacists and other racially motivated extremists has almost tripled, he said.

Many of the senators’ questions Tuesday centered on the FBI’s handling of a Jan. 5 report from its Norfolk, Virginia, field office that warned of online posts foreshadowing a “war” in Washington the following day. Capitol Police leaders have said they were unaware of the report at the time, and the former chief of the department has said he received no intelligence from the FBI that would have led him to anticipate the sort of violence that besieged them on the 6th.

ADVERTISEMENT

Five people died that day, including a Capitol Police officer and a woman who was shot as she tried to climb through a smashed window into the House chamber with lawmakers still inside.

Wray said the report was disseminated though the FBI’s joint terrorism task force, discussed at a command post in Washington and posted on an internet portal available to other law enforcement agencies.

Though the information was raw, unverified and appeared aspirational in nature, Wray said, it was specific and concerning enough that “the smartest thing to do, the most prudent thing to do, was just push it to the people who needed to get it.”

“We did communicate that information in a timely fashion to the Capitol Police and (Metropolitan Police Department) in not one, not two, but three different ways,” Wray said, though he added that since the violence that ensued was “not an acceptable result,” the FBI was looking into what it could have done differently.

He said he was “reluctant to armchair quarterback anyone else in their jobs,” but the FBI was determined to prevent a repeat of Jan. 6.

“We find it personally infuriating any time we are not able, as I said, to bat 1,000. And we’re going to keep working to get better,” he said.

The sprawling Justice Department investigation into the riot has already produced hundreds of charges, including against members of militia groups and far-right organizations. The crowd in Washington that day ranged from protesters who did not break any laws to a smaller group that arrived determined to commit violence against police and disrupt Congress from its duties, Wray said.

“Some of those people clearly came to Washington, we now know, with the plans and intentions to engage in the worst kind of violence we would consider domestic terrorism,” he said.

Asked whether there was evidence that the attack was planned or carried out by antifa — an umbrella term for leftist militants — or by Trump opponents posing as his loyalists, Wray said that there was not. Some on the right have made such false contentions.

Even as the FBI prioritizes its efforts to counter domestic violent extremism, there are challenges confronting law enforcement, including in separating mere chatter from actual threats and in First Amendment protections that give ample leeway to espouse racist or otherwise abhorrent viewpoints.

“The amount of angry, hateful, unspeakable, combative, violent even, rhetoric on social media exceeds what anybody in their worst imagination (thinks) is out there,” Wray said.

Wray has kept a notably low profile since the Capitol attack. Though he has briefed lawmakers privately and shared information with local law enforcement, Tuesday’s oversight hearing marked his first public appearance before Congress since before November’s presidential election.

lj47c2	liberal	New details about Trump-McCarthy shouting match show Trump refused to call off the rioters	"Washington (CNN) In an expletive-laced phone call with House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy while the US Capitol was under attack , then-President Donald Trump said the rioters cared more about the election results than McCarthy did.

""Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are,"" Trump said, according to lawmakers who were briefed on the call afterward by McCarthy.

McCarthy insisted that the rioters were Trump's supporters and begged Trump to call them off.

Trump's comment set off what Republican lawmakers familiar with the call described as a shouting match between the two men. A furious McCarthy told the then-President the rioters were breaking into his office through the windows, and asked Trump, ""Who the f--k do you think you are talking to?"" according to a Republican lawmaker familiar with the call.

The newly revealed details of the call, described to CNN by multiple Republicans briefed on it, provide critical insight into the President's state of mind as rioters were overrunning the Capitol. The existence of the call and some of its details were first reported by Punchbowl News and discussed publicly by McCarthy.

The Republican members of Congress said the exchange showed Trump had no intention of calling off the rioters even as lawmakers were pleading with him to intervene. Several said it amounted to a dereliction of his presidential duty.

""He is not a blameless observer. He was rooting for them,"" a Republican member of Congress said. ""On January 13, Kevin McCarthy said on the floor of the House that the President bears responsibility and he does.""

Speaking to the President from inside the besieged Capitol, McCarthy pressed Trump to call off his supporters and engaged in a heated disagreement about who comprised the crowd. Trump's comment about the would-be insurrectionists caring more about the election results than McCarthy did was first mentioned by Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, a Republican from Washington state, in a town hall earlier this week, and was confirmed to CNN by Herrera Beutler and other Republicans briefed on the conversation.

""You have to look at what he did during the insurrection to confirm where his mind was at,"" Herrera Beutler, one of 10 House Republicans who voted last month to impeach Trump, told CNN. ""That line right there demonstrates to me that either he didn't care, which is impeachable, because you cannot allow an attack on your soil, or he wanted it to happen and was OK with it, which makes me so angry.""

""We should never stand for that, for any reason, under any party flag,"" she added, voicing her extreme frustration. ""I'm trying really hard not to say the F-word.""

Herrera Beutler went a step further Friday night, calling on others to speak up about any other details they might know regarding conversations Trump and then-Vice President Mike Pence had on January 6.

""To the patriots who were standing next to the former president as these conversations were happening, or even to the former vice president: if you have something to add here, now would be the time,"" she said in a statement.

Another Republican member of Congress said the call was problematic for Trump.

""I think it speaks to the former President's mindset,"" said Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, an Ohio Republican who also voted to impeach Trump last month. ""He was not sorry to see his unyieldingly loyal vice president or the Congress under attack by the mob he inspired. In fact, it seems he was happy about it or at the least enjoyed the scenes that were horrifying to most Americans across the country.""

As senators prepare to determine Trump's fate, multiple Republicans thought the details of the call were important to the proceedings because they believe it paints a damning portrait of Trump's lack of action during the attack. At least one of the sources who spoke to CNN took detailed notes of McCarthy's recounting of the call.

Trump and McCarthy did not respond to requests for comment.

It took Trump several hours after the attack began to eventually encourage his supporters to ""go home in peace"" -- a tweet that came at the urging of his top aides.

At Trump's impeachment trial Friday, his lawyers argued that the former President did in fact try to calm the rioters with a series of tweets while the attack unfolded. But his lawyers cherry-picked his tweets, focusing on his request for supporters to ""remain peaceful"" without mentioning that he also attacked Pence and waited hours to explicitly urge rioters to leave the Capitol.

A source close to Pence said Trump's legal team was not telling the truth when attorney Michael van der Veen said at the trial that ""at no point"" did the then-President know his vice president was in danger.

Asked whether van der Veen was lying, the source said, ""Yes."" Former Pence aides are still fuming over Trump's actions on January 6, insisting he never checked on the vice president as Pence was being rushed from danger by his US Secret Service detail.

It's unclear to what extent these new details were known by the House Democratic impeachment managers or whether the team considered calling McCarthy as a witness. The managers have preserved the option to call witnesses in the ongoing impeachment trial, although that option remains unlikely as the trial winds down.

The House Republican leader had been forthcoming with his conference about details of his conversations with Trump on and after January 6.

Trump himself has not taken any responsibility in public.

hrdcpi	liberal	Tucker Carlson announces vacation after racist writer resigns from Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson announced he’s taking a vacation Monday night after addressing the resignation of his show’s former writer over racist remarks online.

According to the Daily Beast, “Tucker Carlson Tonight” writer Blake Neff resigned last week after CNN reported Neff had been posting racist, sexist and homophobic comments on the online forum AutoAdmit under a pseudonym. Neff used the message board for law school students and “supporters of the marketplace of ideas and freedom of expression” to criticize Black and Asian people, the Mormon church, immigrants and more.

“First, what Blake wrote anonymously was wrong,” Carlson said on his top-rated show Monday night. “We don’t endorse those words. They have no connection to the show. It is wrong to attack people for qualities they cannot control. In this country, we judge people for what they do, not for how they were born.”

Carlson offered no apology and criticized others in the media for their “self-righteousness.”

“Blake fell short of that standard and he has paid a very high price for it but we should also point out to the ghouls now beating their chests in triumph of the destruction of a young man, that self-righteousness also has its costs,” Carlson said. “We are all human. When we pretend we are holy, we are lying. When we pose as blameless in order to hurt other people, we are committing the gravest sin of all, and we will be punished for it. There’s no question.”

Carlson is visibly less displeased with Neff in this clip than he is with the reporters who exposed Neff. https://t.co/mkfYz5mJKc — Matt Ford (@fordm) July 14, 2020

CNN’s Oliver Darcy points out Carlson also didn’t describe any of the remarks by Neff or condemn them as racist or sexist.

“The average viewer tuning in who had not seen our reporting may have come away with the impression that Neff had made some edgy remarks years ago and was forced out by a cancel culture mob. That’s *NOT* what happened, but Carlson structured his remarks leaving room for that interpretation,” Darcy wrote. “As Erik Wemple tweeted, ‘Viewers who hadn’t seen the stories might have no idea what he was saying.‘”

In a statement Saturday, Fox News Chief Executive Suzanne Scott and Fox News Media President and Executive Editor Jay Wallace condemned Neff’s remarks as “horrendous and deeply offensive.”

“We want to make abundantly clear that Fox News Media strongly condemns this horrific racist, misogynistic and homophobic behavior,” they said in a statement. “Neff’s abhorrent conduct was never divulged to the show until Friday, at which point we swiftly accepted his resignation. Make no mistake, actions such as his cannot and will not be tolerated at any time in any part of our work force.”

Meanwhile, Deadline reports Carlson’s claim that Neff’s words “have no connection to the show” are also being disputed.

“Anything he’s reading off the teleprompter, the first draft was written by me,” said Neff, who’d been writing for the show since it took over Bill O’Reilly’s time slot in 2017, in the most recent issue of Dartmouth Alumni Magazine. “We’re very aware that we do have that power to sway the conversation, so we try to use it responsibly.”

Carlson ended the broadcast by announcing he would take a pre-planned vacation.

“Going to spend the next four days trout fishing,” he said. “Long planned, this is one of those years where if you don’t get it in now, you’re probably not going to do if something dramatic happens, of course. We’ll be back.”"	left
ks3evq	liberal	Vision emerges of police moving barricades to allow rioters into US Capitol, taking selfies Fury has erupted over vision of police officers removing barricades to allow pro-Trump crowds into the Capitol and taking selfies with rioters	"Footage has emerged of police officers removing barricades to allow pro-Trump crowds into the Capitol.

Footage has emerged of police officers removing barricades to allow pro-Trump crowds into the Capitol....

Vision has emerged of police at the US Capitol appearing to remove barricades to allow pro-Trump protesters to gain access to the building, and another officer posing for a selfie.

Washington DC is in the grips of utter chaos after a large number of Donald Trump supporters descended on Capitol Hill to stage a fiery demonstration.

Media described law enforcement at the scene as having been “overwhelmed” as rioters stormed the building.

CNN reported that police at the Capitol building were caught off guard and didn’t expect people to breach a series of fences leading up to the building.

But questions are being raised on social media about how seriously some police officers took the incident, given vision that has emerged.

A clip posted on TikTok from the scene shows police removing barriers to allow the rioters to continue towards the Capitol steps.

In addition, footage streamed live from inside appears to show police posing for selfies with members of the group.

National Guard troops have been deployed in a bid to restore order and Washington DC will be subjected to a 12-hour curfew tonight.

The FBI deployed SWAT-style officers to sweep the building in an attempt to remove pro-Trump rioters, who took control of the Senate floor as well as various offices of high-profile members.

But the slow response of authorities is already being criticised by politicians and commentators.

Joy speaking the truth. Thank you @JoyAnnReid pic.twitter.com/BpkgjL4Hq5 — Blair LM Kelley, PhD (@profblmkelley) January 6, 2021

MSNBC national correspondent Joy-Ann Reid was blistering in her analysis of the attack on the Capitol, saying it showed white Americans think they “own the place” and why they “aren’t afraid of the cops”.

“They know that they are not in jeopardy, because the cops are taking selfies with them, walking them down the steps to make sure they’re not hurt, taking care with their bodies, not like how they treated Freddie Gray’s body... white people are never afraid of the cops, even when they’re committing insurrection.”

She added if it were a Black Lives Matter protest “there would already be people shackled, arrested en masse, or dead”.

“They know the cops are cool with it,” Ms Reid added.

Four people have been confirmed dead.

It’s the not the first time police have been criticised for their actions at right-wing protests over recent years.

In Austin, police were forced to reiterate their stance on uniformed officers appearing in photos after a number appeared in a shot with a member of the Proud Boys group flashing a white supremacist symbol.

The Austin Police Department’s guidelines say officers aren’t allowed to be uniformed in photos that endorse or supports any political campaign or initiative or any social issue or cause.

It defended its department officers continuing to take photos with people when requested, saying “they do it to help foster relationships within our community”.

“If these officers were aware of the behaviour of those on the fringe of the group, there is no doubt in my mind that they would not have participated in the picture,” an APD statement read.

The actions of the rioters today has been described by some watching it unfold as “insurrection” being committed by “domestic terrorists”.

US Vice President Mike Pence described it as an “attack” which “must stop now”.

After initially writing two limp tweets before retiring to the Oval to watch the chaos unfold on television, US President Donald Trump eventually released a video telling the rioters to “go home now”.

But he also repeated the unsubstantiated and increasingly unsupported claim that the election has been stolen."	left

ALAMO, Texas (AP) — President Donald Trump on Tuesday took no responsibility for his part in fomenting a violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol last week, despite his comments encouraging supporters to march on the Capitol and praise for them while they were still carrying out the assault.

“People thought that what I said was totally appropriate,” Trump said.

He made the comments during his first appearance in public since the Capitol siege, which came as lawmakers were tallying Electoral College votes affirming President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. Trump arrived in Texas on Tuesday to trumpet his campaign against illegal immigration in an attempt to burnish his legacy with eight days remaining in his term, as lawmakers in Congress appeared set to impeach him this week for the second time.

In Alamo, Texas, a city in the Rio Grande Valley near the U.S.-Mexican border — the site of the 450th mile of the border wall his administration is building, Trump brushed off Democratic calls on his Cabinet to declare him unfit from office and remove him from power using the 25th Amendment.

“The 25th Amendment is of zero risk to me, but will come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Biden administration,” Trump said. “As the expression goes, be careful of what you wish for.”

The rampage through the halls of Congress sent lawmakers of both parties and Trump’s own vice president into hiding, as crowds called for Mike Pence’s lynching for his role overseeing the vote count. The scene also undermined the hallmark of the republic — the peaceful transition of power. At least five people died, including one Capitol Police officer.

“It’s time for peace and for calm,” Trump said Tuesday, less than a week after egging on the mob that descended on the Capitol. He added, “Respect for law enforcement is the foundation of the MAGA agenda,” referencing his campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.”

In the days leading up to the Jan. 6 certification vote, Trump encouraged his supporters to descend on Washington, D.C., promising a “wild” rally in support of his baseless claims of election fraud, despite his own administration’s findings to the contrary. Speaking for more than an hour to a crowd on the Ellipse, Trump encouraged supporters to “fight like hell” and suggested that Republican lawmakers would need “more courage not to step up” and overturn the will of voters to grant him another term in office. He also suggested he would join them in marching on the Capitol.

As Trump wrapped up, thousands of his supporters were already heading to the Capitol, where lawmakers convened to count the electoral votes. As rioters were still in the building and lawmakers sheltered in secure locations, Trump, at the urging of aides who were shocked by the violence, released a video seemingly excusing the events, saying of the rioters: “We love you. You’re very special. Go home.”

Speaking Tuesday, Trump said the “real problem” was not his rhetoric, but the rhetoric that Democrats used to describe Black Lives Matter protests and violence in Seattle and Portland this summer.

“Everybody to the ‘t’ thought it was totally appropriate,” Trump said of his own comments.

Trump angrily lashed out at lawmakers’ push for his second impeachment this week, claiming, “It’s causing tremendous anger and division and pain far greater than most people will ever understand, which is very dangerous for the USA, especially at this very tender time.”

Alamo is named after the San Antonio mission where a small group of Texan independence-fighters fended off Mexican forces during a 13-day siege. Most of them died, but the mission became a symbol of resistance for Texans, who eventually defeated the Mexican army.

Trump’s visit there — no doubt a symbol of the president’s defiance — comes as he spends the final days of his presidency isolated, aggrieved and staring down the prospect of a second impeachment.

While Trump was traveling, Pence assured the nation’s governors that outgoing administration is working “diligently” with President-elect Joe Biden’s team. He thanked the governors for their leadership on the coronavirus and promised them a “seamless transition.”

Trump aides have been urging the president to spend his remaining days in office highlighting what they see as the chief accomplishments of his presidency: a massive tax cut, his efforts to roll back federal regulations and the transformation of federal courts with the appointment of conservative judges. But Trump has been consumed by baseless allegations of voter fraud and conspiracies.

In Texas, he delivered remarks highlighting his administration’s efforts to curb illegal immigration and the progress made on his signature 2016 campaign promise: building a “big, beautiful wall” across the length of the southern border — an imposing structure made of concrete and reinforced steel. But over time, Trump demanded modifications that have been largely rejected: He wanted it painted black to burn the hands of those who touched it; he wanted it adorned with deadly spikes; he even wanted to surround it with an alligator-filled moat. While he promised that it would be funded by Mexico, U.S. taxpayers ended up footing the bill.

In the end, his administration has overseen the construction of roughly 450 miles of border wall construction — likely reaching 475 miles by Inauguration Day. The vast majority of that wall replaces smaller barriers that had already existed, though the new wall is considerably more difficult to bypass.

Over the last four years, Trump and his administration have taken extreme — and often unlawful — action to try to curb both illegal and legal immigration. Their efforts were aided in his final year by the coronavirus pandemic, which ground international travel to a halt. But the number of people stopped trying to cross the southern border illegally has been creeping back up in recent months. Figures from December show nearly 74,000 encounters at the southwest border, up 3% from November and up 81% from a year earlier.

A few dozen Trump supporters rallied hours before his visit to the Rio Grande Valley near the Harlingen, Texas, airport, where he was scheduled to land. They planned to stage a caravan of vehicles flying flags that support the president and far-right causes like the QAnon conspiracy theory.

Full Coverage: Capitol siege

Trump warned that a reversal of his policies by Biden would bring about a “tidal wave of illegal immigration.” He added, “To terminate those policies is knowingly to put America in really serious danger.”

Biden has said he’d halt construction of the border wall and take executive action where possible to reverse some of Trump’s restrictions on legal immigration and asylum seekers. But Biden and his aides have acknowledged the possibility of a new crisis at the border if they act too quickly, and Biden has said it could take six months for his administration to secure funding and put in place the necessary infrastructure to loosen Trump-era restrictions.

Beyond touting the wall, Trump rapidly listed his massive changes on the border aimed at discouraging asylum. He cited his “Remain in Mexico” policy, under which more than 65,000 asylum-seekers have been forced to wait in Mexico for hearings in U.S. immigration court since January 2019, and agreements struck with Central American countries for them to offer asylum to people seeking protection in the United States.

He credited his wall for a drop in illegal border crossings from a 13-year high in 2019, but the Government Accountability Office has found the administration lacks measures to correlate drops in illegal crossings to wall construction.

Trump said, falsely, that he inherited “open borders” from his predecessor, Barack Obama. He leaves office with about the same number of Border Patrol agents than when he began, despite a pledge to add 5,000, and the monthly number of migrants stopped at the border exceeds totals during much of Obama’s tenure.

lnikzt	liberal	Six Capitol police officers suspended, others investigated after Capitol riot	"The United States Capitol Police has suspended six officers and is investigating a total of nearly 30 others in connection with their actions responding to the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot.

The department said in a statement shared with The Hill on Friday that the Capitol Police’s Office of Professional Responsibility is investigating a total of 35 officers, and that “Acting Chief Yogananda Pittman has directed that any member of her department whose behavior is not in keeping with the Department’s Rules of Conduct will face appropriate discipline.""

Fox’s Washington, D.C., affiliate, WTTG, first reported the investigations Thursday and CNN also reported that additional probes may take place as investigators look through social media posts and allegations that officers may have been involved in the riot itself.

The suspensions and investigations come amid increased scrutiny over the Capitol Police’s response to the mob attack, in which multiple people died amid the chaos, including Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick. Two additional officers who responded to the rioting have since died by suicide.

Capitol Police last month, in the days following the siege, confirmed it was investigating the actions of some of its officers, with Pittman saying in a statement at the time that the department was “actively reviewing video and other open source materials of some USCP officers and officials that appear to be in violation of Department regulations and policies.”

“Our Office of Professional Responsibility will investigate these behaviors for disciplinary action, up to, and including, termination,” Pittman added. “Several USCP officers have already been suspended pending the outcome of their investigations.”

Pittman took over as acting head of the department after former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund announced he would resign amid lawmaker pressure the day following the breach of the Capitol.

Rep. Tim Ryan Timothy (Tim) RyanDemocrats confront difficult prospects for midterms Tim Ryan touts labor support in Senate bid Democratic leaders push to boost congressional staff pay MORE (D-Ohio), who chairs the funding committee that oversees the Capitol Police, said last month that one of the officers suspended had been seen taking a selfie with one of the rioters, while another had worn a “Make America Great Again” hat and gave directions to the mob.

krsik7	liberal	Biden to nominate Merrick Garland as attorney general	"(CNN) President-elect Joe Biden has decided to nominate Judge Merrick Garland as attorney general, people familiar with the matter tell CNN, a long-awaited decision that moved toward completion Wednesday as it became apparent that Democrats were on the brink of winning control of the Senate.

The announcement of the attorney general, along with other senior leaders of the Justice Department, is expected to be made as soon as Thursday as Biden moves closer to filling the remaining seats in his Cabinet before assuming power on January 20.

Biden has selected Lisa Monaco, a former homeland security adviser in the Obama administration who has become a close aide to Biden, to be the deputy attorney general, according to a person familiar with the decision.

The President-elect has selected Vanita Gupta, who served as principal deputy assistant attorney general and led the civil rights division at the Department of Justice under President Barack Obama, to be associate attorney general, and Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the National Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, to be assistant attorney general for civil rights, the person said.

Garland was chosen by Biden for attorney general over former Alabama Sen. Doug Jones and former acting attorney general Sally Yates, the two other finalists for the position.

While Garland has been a top contender for weeks, concerns about the vacancy his selection would create on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia raised alarm bells among Biden and many advisers who believed Senate Republicans would block any nomination to that seat. But with Democrats poised to control the Senate after two Georgia runoff races, those concerns were allayed.

""Judge Garland will be viewed in a whole new light now,"" a top Biden ally tells CNN.

Politico first reported the pick.

Late last month, Biden told reporters he was not waiting until the Georgia races were finished to make his decision. But this week, that's exactly what he is doing. Advisers insist a variety of factors led to the decision of Garland, but acknowledged that the long, often-criticized deliberations of Biden actually paid off in this case.

Garland, who in recent weeks has stepped away from hearing cases on the bench to prepare for the prospect of the nomination, steadily emerged as a leading contender over the last two months since Biden won the election.

The revelation that there is a federal investigation into the taxes and business dealings of Hunter Biden, the President-elect's son, also contributed to those pushing Garland.

Defenders of Garland argued he would be a particularly strong choice to lead the Justice Department in the post-Trump era because he is seen as above reproach of partisan politics. Some allies describe him as a ""Boy Scout,"" which is intended to suggest he would be seen as a non-political figure.

In the end, a confluence of factors drove the decision, but people familiar with the matter say it's largely because of how Biden believes Garland can rise above politics in the post-Trump era.

President Donald Trump's escalating post-election antics have solidified Biden's view of choosing Garland, people familiar with the matter say, as Biden believes the nation demands competence and craves unity.

Obama nominated Garland to the Supreme Court after a vacancy was created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in 2016. But Republicans, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, refused for months to hold confirmation hearings or the required vote in the chamber.

When Trump took office, Garland's nomination expired and he returned to his position as chief judge of the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. The court is charged with reviewing challenges to administrative agencies. He stepped down from the position as chief judge in February 2020, but still serves on the court. President Bill Clinton appointed him to the court in 1997.

Prior to his appointment as a US circuit judge, Garland served as principal associate deputy attorney general. He supervised the investigation of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which killed more than 160 people and injured several hundred more. Garland also led the investigations of the 1996 Olympics bombing in Atlanta, in which two people died and more than 100 others were injured.

Garland led the investigation into Ted Kaczynski, also known as ""The Unabomber,"" who is currently serving eight life sentences for murder. He killed three people and injured more than 20 others with a string of mail bombings.

The judge served as an assistant US attorney for the District of Columbia from 1989 to 1992, and as deputy assistant attorney general in the criminal division of the Justice Department from 1993 to 1994.

Garland's nomination will disappoint those who had pressured Biden to nominate a person of color as attorney general.

Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris met last month with civil rights leaders and members of the NAACP, who have been pressuring Biden to diversify his Cabinet and create a position within the White House for a civil rights czar. The Rev. Al Sharpton said at a news conference after the meeting that Biden should choose an attorney general with a civil rights background and said his preference would be a Black nominee.

Sharpton said mentioned as potential picks former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and Tony West, the senior vice president and chief legal officer at Uber who was previously the associate attorney general of the United States under the Obama administration.

Clarke said at the same news conference that whoever is selected as attorney general ""must have a clear and bold record when it comes to civil rights and racial justice.""

Sharpton responded to the Garland pick with a skeptical statement and asked for a meeting with the nominee.

""I would have still preferred a Black Attorney General nominee or someone with a clear record on voting rights and police reform, particularly at this day and time,"" Sharpton said in a statement. ""I'm unclear on Judge Garland's record on both and there are very few, if any, written arguments that he has as a Judge to track these positions.""

He added: ""I therefore think that he should immediately meet with the civil rights leadership that has met with President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris to discuss things like enforcement of voting rights and police accountability as well as pending legislation with both.""

meomeh	liberal	The For the People Act Would Stop Voter Suppression in Its Tracks	"This is adapted from testimony before to the Senate Committee on Rules & Administration.

The For the People Act (S. 1) would be the most significant democracy reform measure in over half a century. It is the next great civil rights bill and comes in response to the demand for racial justice in our country. It is long overdue and it is urgently needed now.

There are a number of reforms in the legislation relating to curbing the role of money in politics, dealing with gerrymandering, dealing with ethics. I want to focus on the sacred right to vote, which is in so many ways at the heart of our democracy and of our understanding of ourselves as Americans.

In the 2020 election, despite the pandemic, despite voter suppression, despite the lies, it was the highest voter turnout since 1900. The Trump administration’s own Department of Homeland Security confirmed it was the “most secure election ever.” This is something we ought to celebrate.

Instead, what has happened? We had the Big Lie about the election being stolen. We had the insurrection driven by that Big Lie.

And now, in states across the country, we see a wave of legislative attempts to curb the vote, the most significant attempted cutback of voting rights since the Jim Crow era. The Brennan Center has studied these laws for years and last month found 253 bills in 43 states, seven times the rate of four years ago, and the number is even higher right now.

These bills are being pushed hard. It is only March, and already the governor of Iowa is signing into law significant cutbacks to vote by mail. In Georgia, the legislature is finishing its work on an egregious bill. Some of its proposals would have effectively ended no-excuse vote by mail but preserved it for older voters, who tend to be white and Republican. Another would have repealed automatic voter registration, which had been put in place by the Republican governor. Another proposal would have ended early voting on the Sunday before Election Day, the day used by Black churches for “souls to the polls.” There was a public outcry that has forced some changes, but there are still tremendously harmful provisions that will be moving through the legislature.

These laws affect voters of color, young voters, poor voters. Their intent is often unambiguous. One of the sponsors of these bills in Arizona said the purpose was to make sure that only “quality” voters could vote — not that everyone would have the right to vote. That does not strike me as true to our American spirit.

The For the People Act deals with this in a very important way. It would stop the new wave of voter suppression, cold. It stops it in its tracks, and Congress has the power, the right, the authority — constitutionally and legally — to do this.

This bill would set national standards to ensure that all eligible citizens have the freedom to vote and the ability to make that ballot count. It would make automatic voter registration — already the law in 19 states, Republican and Democratic — the law of the land. It would ensure access to vote by mail and early voting, as well as other measures that have proven popular and effective in recent years and used enthusiastically by tens of millions of people. It would restore the right to vote for returning citizens after they have been incarcerated, so they can rejoin society. Every one of these policies has worked at the national, state, or local level.

It would also bolster election security and confidence in our elections. You are more likely to be struck by lightning than to commit voter impersonation in the United States. We can’t allow the conspiracy theory about massive misconduct to guide policy.

Finally, this legislation honors the Constitution. The Elections Clause gives Congress the power to set a national standard for the “times, places, and manner” of federal elections. The Supreme Court in 2019, in an opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts, specifically pointed to this legislation as a constitutionally sound example of Congress’s power to set election law.

This is part of the great story of American democracy. Will we live up to our best ideals? Will we build a multiracial democracy that really represents all people, or will we allow a drive to take place to turn the clock back to cut back on voting rights? This legislation would be a significant and long overdue milestone for our country and I urge you to enact it.

htabbd	liberal	Rep. John Lewis, civil rights icon, dies at age 80	"Rep. John Lewis, the legendary civil rights leader who helped organize the March on Washington and was later known as the “conscience of Congress,” died Friday at age 80. The Georgia Democrat announced in December 2019 that he had been diagnosed with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer. “I have been in some kind of fight ― for freedom, equality, basic human rights ― for nearly my entire life,” Lewis said in a statement at the time. “I have never faced a fight quite like the one I have now.”

Arthur Matott (from left), John Lewis (head of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee), Andrew Young, Sister Mary Leoline and Theodore Gill.

Lewis has been on the front lines of the fight for democracy for most of his life. Born on Feb. 21, 1940, to sharecroppers outside of Troy, Alabama, Lewis grew up attending segregated public schools. After watching the activism that sparked the Montgomery bus boycott and hearing the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s words on the radio, Lewis was inspired to join the civil rights movement and fought for voting rights ever since. As a college student attending Fisk University, Lewis helped organize peaceful sit-in protests at segregated lunch counters in Nashville, Tennessee. At age 21, he volunteered to be a Freedom Rider — one of the activists who risked their lives challenging segregation throughout the South by sitting in seats reserved for white people. (The protest was inspired by Rosa Parks, who refused to give up her bus seat for a white man in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1955.) Lewis helped found the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and became its chairman during the peak of the civil rights movement from 1963 to 1966. Lewis organized student activism in the movement through SNCC and was eventually considered one of the “Big Six” leaders of the civil rights movement, alongside King.

At 23, Lewis was one of the organizers of and the youngest keynote speaker at the March on Washington in August 1963. He helped launch voter registration drives during the Mississippi Freedom Summer in 1964, yet another example of his determination to bring voting rights to Black people. Lewis often faced violent consequences for his civil rights leadership. He was repeatedly arrested and beaten by police and angry mobs for challenging Jim Crow segregation in the South and fighting for voting rights. Alabama state troopers fractured Lewis’ skull in March 1965 while he led more than 600 peaceful demonstrators in a voting rights protest across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, during what became known as Bloody Sunday. Media coverage of the cruelty during Bloody Sunday ― and the subsequent successful Selma march in which Lewis walked alongside King ― helped usher in the passage of the Voting Rights Act that year.

Lewis was elected to the Atlanta City Council in 1981 and to Congress in 1986. He served as House Democrats’ senior chief deputy whip and as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee.

Throughout his congressional career, Lewis fought to enact laws that furthered the civil rights and moral principles that he had championed since he was a young man. He helped campaign for Stacey Abrams, the Democrat who lost the 2018 gubernatorial election in Georgia and has since dedicated her career to fighting for voting rights amid allegations of Black voter suppression in the state. “I gave a little blood on that bridge in Selma, 53 years ago,” Lewis told a crowd at a rally for Abrams just days before the election. “I’m not asking any of you to give any blood. I’m just asking you to go and vote like you never voted before. We have to vote.” Lewis was also unfiltered in his criticism of President Donald Trump and refused to attend the 2018 State of the Union address after Trump characterized Haiti and African nations as “shitholes.” The congressman said in May 2019 that if King were alive today, Lewis would tell him that Trump is “a racist” who “doesn’t understand the meaning of your life and the significance of the civil rights movement.” Lewis was a strong supporter of impeaching Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, warning that the country he once considered a “beacon of hope” may be “descending into darkness.” Before voting to formally impeach the president in December 2019, Lewis delivered an emotional, fiery speech that alluded to his experiences in Washington that helped define the civil rights movement. “When you see something that is not right, not just, not fair, you have a moral obligation to say something, do something,” the civil rights icon said. “Our children and their children will ask us: ‘What did you do? What did you say?’”

lsiwvd	liberal	House passes Equality Act	"(CNN) The House has passed the Equality Act, which would amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act to protect people from being discriminated based on sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing and other services as well as access to public accommodations such as restaurants.

The final vote was 224-206. Three Republicans joined Democrats in voting for the bill. Reps. John Katko, Tom Reed, and Brian Fitzpatrick voted with Democrats on this vote, and did so when the legislation passed in the House in 2019 as well. When the bill passed the House floor in 2019, eight Republicans joined Democrats to vote for the legislation.

Advocates for the LGTBQ community argue the legislation will help protect people in states where it's legal to discriminate people and add the law is long overdue.

The House first passed the Equality Act in 2019, but now its passage comes under Democratic control with President Joe Biden in the White House and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announcing Thursday he already intends to bring this legislation to the floor.

""We are really excited to have the incredible support of President Biden and his commitment to make the Equality Act the law of the land,"" Rep. David Cicilline, a cosponsor of the Equality Act said Thursday. ""Every American deserves respect and dignity and it's important that the Equality Act become law because it will once and for all ensure that LGBTQ Americans can live lives free of discrimination.""

j3or19	liberal	Trump and Melania test positive for COVID-19	"(CNN) President Donald Trump announced early Friday that he and his wife both tested positive for the coronavirus, an extraordinary development coming months into a global pandemic and in the final stretch of his reelection campaign in which he has flouted experts' guidance on preventing the disease's spread.

The diagnosis amounts to the most serious known health threat to a sitting American president in decades. At 74 years old and obese, Trump falls into the highest risk category for serious complications from the disease, which has killed more than 200,000 Americans and more than 1 million people worldwide.

His infection with the disease could prove destabilizing in an already fraught political climate, and stock market futures tumbled on news of Trump's infection.

""Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!"" Trump tweeted shortly before 1 a.m. Friday.

Later, the first lady wrote on Twitter that she and her husband were ""feeling good.""

Trump was last seen in public on Thursday afternoon, returning to the White House after a fundraising trip to New Jersey. He did not appear ill, though he did not speak to reporters as he walked into his residence.

In a memo issued to reporters around 1 a.m. ET, the President's physician, Navy Cmdr. Dr. Sean Conley, wrote that he received confirmation of the positive tests on Thursday evening.

""The President and First Lady are both well at this time, and they plan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence,"" Conley wrote.

""The White House medical team and I will maintain a vigilant watch, and I appreciate the support provided by some of our country's greatest medical professionals and institutions,"" Conley wrote, without elaborating what assistance was being provided to the White House.

""Rest assured I expect the President to continue carrying out his duties without disruption while recovering, and I will keep you updated on any further developments,"" he wrote.

The President had said late Thursday night that he planned to quarantine after one of his closest aides, Hope Hicks, tested positive for the infection, bringing the disease into his innermost circle. Earlier in the night, he had downplayed the virus' continued spread.

""The end of the pandemic is in sight,"" he said during prerecorded remarks at the annual Al Smith dinner, held virtually because of the health crisis.

Ignoring the science

While the White House frequently touts its extensive testing regimen for the President and those who come into close proximity with him -- aides have deemed him the ""most tested man in the country"" -- the infections underscored the shortcomings in relying on tests alone to prevent contagion.

Trump and many of his aides have eschewed practices like social distancing and mask wearing. At Tuesday evening's presidential debate, the President mocked his rival, Democratic nominee Joe Biden, for frequently wearing a mask.

After announcing the President's diagnosis, the White House issued a new schedule to reflect several canceled events on Friday, including a fundraiser in Washington and a campaign rally in Florida.

The scrubbed plans were the most immediate effects of the President's diagnosis on the presidential campaign, which has centered largely on the pandemic and the President's response to it. Trump has frequently sought to paint a rosy picture of the current situation, including just hours before he announced his diagnosis.

Trump has also repeatedly insisted the country is ""rounding the corner"" on the disease and claimed the virus would ""disappear,"" though even health experts within his own administration said those claims did not reflect reality.

Getting infected himself with coronavirus will do little to further his claims that the disease is waning, and undercut his push for states to reopen schools and businesses. Trump has complained during recent rallies about Democratic governors who have maintained strict lockdowns to prevent the spread of the virus.

At-risk category

Trump has blatantly disregarded medical recommendations from his own coronavirus task force during the pandemic, proceeding with a busy schedule of packed campaign rallies. Most recently, his supporters stuffed into events in Minnesota and Pennsylvania.

Those events appear on hold for now as the President stays at the White House. Long guarded about his medical history, the President's most recent physical showed he weighed 243 pounds -- considered obese for his height. Still, Conley said he was in ""very good health"" in a readout of the exam.

Aside from Hicks, several of the President's aides have tested positive for the coronavirus since the pandemic began ravaging the country earlier this year. In May, two White House staffers, including a member of the Navy who serves as one of Trump's personal valets, tested positive for the virus, and in July a cafeteria employee on the White House grounds tested positive as well. The vice president's press secretary has tested positive, as did the President's national security adviser Robert O'Brien. The President confirmed a fourth positive case on White House grounds last month.

Trump has previously expressed concern that aides contracting the coronavirus would undercut his message that the outbreak is waning and states should accelerate reopening, according to a person who had spoken with him.

And he asked in the spring how it was possible that one of his valets -- responsible for handling his food and drink -- could have come into contact with him.

The White House has since gone to great lengths to shield Trump and Vice President Mike Pence from the outbreak, even as they travel to states where cases are surging.

Close aide tests positive

Hicks has traveled with the President multiple times recently, including to the debate in Cleveland on Tuesday, and was seen boarding Marine One, along with several other of the President's closest aides -- Jared Kushner, Dan Scavino and Nicholas Luna -- none of whom wore masks, on Wednesday as Trump was heading to a campaign rally in Minnesota.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines state that a 14-day quarantine should take place after the last known exposure to someone who has tested positive for Covid-19. This is because the incubation period for the novel coronavirus can be up to two weeks.

Trump, in his Fox News interview, speculated that Hicks could have contracted the virus from an interaction with a supporter.

""She's a very warm person. She has a hard time, when soldiers and law enforcement comes up to her, you know, she wants to treat them great, not say, 'Stay away, I can't get near you.' It's a very, very tough disease,"" he said.

A source close to Hicks told CNN that she is experiencing symptoms and is back in Washington. A source familiar with Hicks' symptoms describes her as being achy and feeling pretty bad. CNN has reached out to Hicks for comment.

""The President takes the health and safety of himself and everyone who works in support of him and the American people very seriously,"" White House spokesman Judd Deere told CNN in a statement when asked about the level of contact between Hicks and Trump.

The White House made no mention of Hicks by name, nor did it confirm she had tested positive.

""White House Operations collaborates with the Physician to the President and the White House Military Office to ensure all plans and procedures incorporate current CDC guidance and best practices for limiting COVID-19 exposure to the greatest extent possible both on complex and when the President is traveling,"" Deere added.

Some White House staffers who were in close proximity were notified of the positive test result today, one official said.

hbcgia	liberal	Trump was willing to halt criminal investigations as 'favor' to dictators, Bolton book says | US news	"Donald Trump was willing to halt criminal investigations to “give personal favors to dictators he liked”, according to a new book written by his former national security adviser John Bolton.

After excerpts from the memoir, which is due to be published later this month, were printed in various news outlets, the Trump administration applied for an emergency temporary restraining order against Bolton on Wednesday night in an attempt to block the book’s release.

Trump himself tweeted that the book was “made up of lies & fake stories” and called Bolton a “disgruntled boring fool who only wanted to go to war”.

Bolton alleges that Trump pleaded with China’s President Xi Jinping to help him get re-elected by buying more US agricultural products, according to accounts of his forthcoming memoir.

In his pursuit of a good personal relationship with Xi, Trump is described as brushing aside human rights issues, even providing encouragement to the communist leader to continue to build concentration camps for China’s Muslim Uighur population.

Bolton argues the House impeachment inquiry should have ranged much further than just Trump’s efforts to pressure the Ukrainian government for his own political gain.

According to excerpts published by the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and the Washington Post, Bolton describes a pattern of corruption in which Trump routinely attempts to use the leverage of US power on other countries to his own personal ends.

“The pattern looked like obstruction of justice as a way of life, which we couldn’t accept,” Bolton writes, adding that he took his concerns to the attorney general, William Barr.

The anecdote involving Xi is particularly damaging for Trump in the run-up to an election in which he is trying to position himself as tough on China, and his opponent, Joe Biden, as being in Beijing’s pocket.

In a statement, Biden said that if Bolton’s “accounts are true, it’s not only morally repugnant, it’s a violation of Trump’s sacred duty to the American people to protect America’s interests and defend our values”.

In The Room Where It Happened, Bolton describes a one-on-one meeting between Trump and Xi on the sidelines of the June 2019 G20 meeting in Japan. Xi complained to Trump about US critics of China, and Trump suggested a way Xi could help him defeat his domestic opposition.

“He [Trump] then, stunningly, turned the conversation to the coming US presidential election, alluding to China’s economic capability to affect the ongoing campaigns, pleading with Xi to ensure he’d win,” Bolton writes.

“He stressed the importance of farmers, and increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome. I would print Trump’s exact words but the government’s prepublication review process has decided otherwise.”

Reports in the wake of the G20 meeting suggested that Trump had put pressure on Xi to buy more US farm produce but Xi had been reluctant to make any commitments. Speaking to the Senate on Wednesday, the US trade representative Robert Lighthizer denied Trump asked Xi for election help.

Trump emerges in the pages of the book as entirely unconcerned by China’s gross human rights violations, including the incarceration of over a million Uighurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang province.

“At the opening dinner of the Osaka G20 meeting in June 2019, with only interpreters present, Xi had explained to Trump why he was basically building concentration camps in Xinjiang,” Bolton writes, according to an excerpt published in the Wall Street Journal.

“According to our interpreter, Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which Trump thought was exactly the right thing to do. The National Security Council’s top Asia staffer, Matthew Pottinger, told me that Trump said something very similar during his November 2017 trip to China.”

Trump also refused to issue a statement commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.

“That was 15 years ago,” he told Bolton (it was the 30th anniversary). “Who cares about it? I’m trying to make a deal. I don’t want anything,” Trump said, according to Bolton’s account.

The Trump administration has attempted to stop the publication of Bolton’s book, claiming it contains classified information. A last-ditch effort by the White House and the justice department this week came too late as copies had already been distributed to booksellers and journalists. Federal prosecutors were reported on Wednesday to be mulling charges against Bolton.

In a statement on Wednesday, responding to the latest attempt, Bolton’s publisher Simon & Schuster called the justice department’s restraining order “a frivolous, politically motivated exercise in futility. Hundreds of thousands of copies have already been distributed around the country and the world. The injunction as requested by the government would accomplish nothing.”

Bolton refused to testify in House impeachment proceedings against Trump, where his account would probably have been the most important piece of evidence put before Congress, and the veteran diplomat was widely accused of holding back his evidence for his book, putting personal profit before duty.

Bolton said he would appear if subpoenaed by the Senate, but Republicans voted to block the appearance of witnesses at the trial.

“Bolton’s staff were asked to testify before the House to Trump’s abuses, and did. They had a lot to lose and showed real courage. When Bolton was asked, he refused, and said he’d sue if subpoenaed. Instead, he saved it for a book,” Adam Schiff, the Democratic chair of the House intelligence committee, wrote on Twitter. “Bolton may be an author, but he’s no patriot.”

Bolton accuses congressional Democrats of committing “impeachment malpractice” by limiting the inquiry to the Ukraine affair (making US military aid conditional on Kyiv handed over compromising information on Biden) and moving too quickly.

Bolton argues that the inquiry should have looked into Trump’s intervention into US investigations into Turkey’s Halkbank to curry favour with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and into the China telecommunications manufacturer ZTE, with the aim of pleasing Xi.

Bolton’s book quotes Trump as saying that invading Venezuela would be “cool” and that it was “really part of the United States”. He recounts a meeting in New Jersey last summer at which Trump railed against journalists, declaring: “These people should be executed. They are scumbags.”

The former national security adviser also confirms what Korea experts long suspected – that the summit diplomacy with Kim Jong-un was intended as spectacle. Trump appeared unconcerned with the whole subject of denuclearisation.

“Trump told … me he was prepared to sign a substance-free communique, have his press conference to declare victory, and then get out of town,” Bolton wrote. The president, however, became obsessed in the following months with getting his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, to deliver an autographed CD of Elton John’s Rocket Man to Kim, to make light of the epithet Trump had formerly used about the North Korean leader.

Bolton’s book also goes through a litany of what Trump does not know about the world – that Britain had nuclear weapons of its own, for example, or that Finland was not part of Russia.

In a conversation with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, the president kept confusing the current and former presidents of Afghanistan.

The book describes Pompeo, who is unstintingly loyal in public, as mocking the president behind his back at a 2018 summit with Kim, slipping Bolton a note about Trump saying: “He is so full of shit.”

kgs9zt	liberal	Heated Oval Office meeting included talk of special counsel, martial law as Trump advisers clash	"(CNN) President Donald Trump convened a heated meeting in the Oval Office on Friday, including lawyer Sidney Powell and her client, former national security adviser Michael Flynn, two people familiar with the matter said, describing a session that began as an impromptu gathering but devolved and eventually broke out into screaming matches at certain points as some of Trump's aides pushed back on Powell and Flynn's more outrageous suggestions about overturning the election.

Flynn had suggested earlier this week that Trump could invoke martial law as part of his efforts to overturn the election that he lost to President-elect Joe Biden -- an idea that arose again during the meeting in the Oval Office, one of the people said. It wasn't clear whether Trump endorsed the idea, but others in the room forcefully pushed back and shot it down.

The meeting was first reported by the New York Times

White House aides who participated in the meeting, including White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and counsel Pat Cipollone, also pushed back intensely on the suggestion of naming Powell as a special counsel to investigate voter fraud allegations Trump's own administration has dismissed (or, as seems more feasible, hiring her in the administration for some kind of investigatory role). Powell has focused her conspiracies on voting machines and has floated the notion of having a special counsel inspect the machines for flaws.

Another idea floated in the meeting was an executive order that would permit the government to access voting machines to inspect them."	left
gvgenk	liberal	Facebook engineer quits job and says Zuckerberg lied about disallowing speech that incites violence	"A Facebook engineer who quit the company on Monday used the platform to announce his news, accusing founder Mark Zuckerberg of lying about the company’s policy regarding Donald Trump’s tweets.

Timothy J Aveni wrote that the president had been exempted from Facebook’s Community Standards for years, posting “abhorrent, targetted messages that would get any other Facebook user suspended from the platform”.

“He’s permitted to break the rules, since his political speech is ‘newsworthy’,” said Mr Aveni.

He then references Mr Trump’s post: “when the looting starts, the shooting starts”, which — intentionally or not — was a quote from Miami police chief Walter Headley in 1967 that provoked an angry response at the time. It seems this was the final straw for Mr Aveni.

He writes: “Mark always told us that he would draw the line at speech that calls for violence. He showed us on Friday that this was a lie. Facebook will keep moving the goalposts every time Trump escalates, finding excuse after excuse not to act on increasingly dangerous rhetoric.”

He continues: “Since Friday, I’ve spent a lot of time trying to understand and process the decision not to remove the racist, violent post Trump made Thursday night, but Facebook, complicit in the propagation of weaponised hatred, is on the wrong side of history.”

Saying that he cannot keep excusing Facebook’s behaviour — providing a platform that enables politicians to radicalise individuals and glorify violence — he likens what is happening in the US to the “social media-fueled division” that has led to death in places such as the Philippines, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka.

“I’m scared for my country and I’m done trying to justify this,” says Mr Aveni.

His last day will be on 12 June, and he signed off his post with the hashtag #blacklivesmatter.

Meanwhile, The New York Times reports that Mr Zuckerberg defended his hands-off approach to Trump’s posts in a question and answer session with employees on Tuesday.

The timing of the session was moved up by two days after hundreds of employees staged a “virtual walkout” on Monday.

He argued that it was a “tough decision” not to do anything about Mr Trump’s inflammatory posts, but the process had been “pretty thorough”.

Mr Zuckerberg said that Facebook’s principles and policies around free speech “show that the right action where we are right now is to leave this up”.

Civil rights groups say that Facebook’s position is “totally confounding”. The company is under pressure to change its stance after Twitter began flagging Mr Trump’s tweets for glorifying violence and being inaccurate."	left
markwn	liberal	"One problem with the GOP's obsession with ""cancel culture:"" nobody cares about it. New polling shows it barely registers as a concern even among young, very online Republicans."	"Many Americans don’t have an opinion about “cancel culture” — or even know what it is. Younger Americans tend to be more familiar with the term at this point, though this could change given how much the GOP is making it a part of its political playbook.

And it’s Republicans under the age of 45 who are really concerned about “cancel culture.”

One in 4 Republicans between the ages of 18 and 44 listed it as a top concern, compared to just 1 percent of Democrats in this same age group, according to a recent YouGov Blue poll. In fact, among younger Republicans, “cancel culture” ranked sixth in terms of overall importance, but for younger Democrats it ranked dead last.

Why Republicans are happy to stoke culture wars? | FiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast

That younger Republicans are more concerned than younger Democrats about “cancel culture” isn’t that surprising, given the amount of attention it’s getting from Republicans compared to Democrats. But the gap is important because it hints at what’s motivating younger Republicans in a party that is increasingly out of step with its youngest members — and it can tell us a lot about why Republicans are betting hard on a political strategy that relies on “cancel culture.”

related: Why Attacking ‘Cancel Culture’ And ‘Woke’ People Is Becoming The GOP’s New Political Strategy Read more. »

For starters, the Republican Party doesn’t align itself with its youngest members on many policy matters. Of course, it is not uncommon for age divisions to emerge within parties — it’s certainly the case for Democrats on health care coverage — but the differences among younger and older Republicans are much bigger and fall along more issues. Poll after poll reveals wide, 20 point-plus gaps on a number of bread-and-butter conservative issues, with younger Republicans much more likely than older Republicans to favor same sex marriage and support expanding renewable energy, and much less likely to view illegal immigration as a big problem for the country.

Additionally, while we need look no further than former President Donald Trump to understand just how powerful a political message centered on grievance or perceived threats to one’s social status can be — especially when linked to issues of white identity — its appeal is not limited to older voters. Younger Republicans are also likely to say that they fear they will be ostracized for their political views. According to Vladimir Medenica, a political science professor at the University of Delaware and research consultant for the GenFoward Survey, (a national bimonthly survey of young adults age 18 to 36), younger Republicans are often far more liberal than older Republicans on many social issues. But, he said, “When we zoom out and think about a more macro-level or structural understanding of society, a lot of young whites look a lot like older whites in their fears of losing status or access in society.”

And many young Republicans are white. In fact, the largest bloc of young Republicans (ages 18 to 29) are white men, according to a 2018 survey from Tuft University’s Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, which found that among young voters, white men were the only racial or gender group to align with the GOP in the midterms. This is important because polling by the Public Religion Research Institute, also from 2018, found that 43 percent of young white men (ages 15 to 24) think that discrimination against white people has become as big a problem as discrimination against Black people and other minority groups. In fact, almost half said in that poll that diversity efforts will harm white people.

In other words, a core part of the younger GOP base is really concerned that they’ll lose their status in society. As Medenica told me, young people are facing real economic challenges as the country also undergoes demographic changes and shifts in political and social power, and that can result in a worldview that “society is changing and it is changing in ways that are threatening,” particularly to white people who feel like they are on the losing end.

related: The Ideas That Are Reshaping The Democratic Party And America Read more. »

Those threats are even more pronounced for young Republicans, given the political power and influence their young Democratic counterparts wield, said Melissa Deckman, a political science professor at Washington College who is working on a book about political mobilization in Generation Z. Deckman, who has been conducting surveys as well as in-depth interviews as part of her research, says that she has found a rise in the number of young women activists (both white women and women of color) who are forming nonprofit organizations to promote their causes and then using social media to organize politically. But this uptick in activism has largely been concentrated on the political left. “There’s not as much happening in terms of organizing among Gen Z on the political right, at least that I’ve been able to discern,” said Deckman.

The fact that there is more political engagement and activity among the young left isn’t that surprising given the political climate of their formative years. They’ve grown up with the Women’s March, Black Lives Matter, #MeToo and March for Our Lives, left-leaning movements in which young people held prominent leadership roles and saw real consequences of their organizing. This isn’t to say that there isn’t any political activity on the young right — arguably, there’s been just as big of a push to organize debates over free speech on college campuses.

The problem is, when it comes to this question of who is wielding political power and influence, those on the young left are often leading the conversation while those on the young right are largely defining their movement in opposition to views on the political left. However, one reason the right’s reactionary movement wields political power is that many of the tones underlying the debates over free speech on campuses are also playing out in conservative media outlets. Young Republicans are already more likely to be plugged into these outlets, like “The Ben Shapiro Show” and PragerU, making them the prime candidates to carry the“cancel culture” mantle.

Younger Americans are also increasingly moving their political debates online. According to Jessica Feezell, a political scientist at the University of New Mexico who studies youth political engagement, young people are discussing politics with friends more than they are volunteering for campaigns or donating money, which is how people have traditionally engaged with politics. Young people have grown up in a time when politics is more “expressive and conversational when compared to previous generations,” says Feezell.

And because much of that conservation is now happening online, there is also a debate raging on what is acceptable as part of that conversation, which Feezell told me also feeds into this perception that political discourse is being curbed. Consider that Republicans are already more likely to say they self-censor their political views than Democrats, because they fear retribution. This, in turn, can create a group that is “unfamiliar or unable to engage [politically] in other ways,” according to Feezell, which explains in part why the GOP has both stoked fears around “cancel culture” and has made opposition to it a litmus test of sorts.

But this emphasis on “cancel culture” might not bode well for Republicans. Yes, “cancel culture” really does motivate the GOP’s youngest bloc of voters as well as older Republicans, but that’s pretty much it. There just aren’t many policies where older Republicans and younger Republicans are aligned.

CORRECTION (March 22, 2021, 3:55 p.m.): A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that 55 percent of young white men think that discrimination against white people has become as big a problem as discrimination against Black people and other minority groups. In fact, that number was 43 percent.

i1lnwn	liberal	Trump Halts TV Advertising as He Struggles in Polls Against Biden	"Some former Trump officials said it was a good move to step back in the middle of the summer, when there was still plenty of time to readjust.

“Considering the curveball Covid threw into the political landscape, it’s smart of the campaign to reassess what the most effective messaging is and where and when to place their ad dollars,” said Sean Spicer, the former White House press secretary who ran communications for the Republican National Committee in 2016.

But other Republican observers questioned the wisdom of going dark so close to the election.

“It’s too early to determine what impact the cancellation of TV has on the Trump campaign, but any time your opponent is running ads with no retaliation it can have significant impact,” said Sig Rogich, a Republican strategist from Nevada who worked on George H.W. Bush’s campaigns and advised Senator John McCain during his 2008 presidential bid. He recalled a moment in the 1988 presidential race when the Bush team spent an entire week between conventions as the only campaign on air, helping to erase the lead of his opponent, Michael Dukakis.

But that was also before digital advertising became a major arm of a campaign’s messaging strategy, and the Trump campaign is still pouring millions into digital ads each day. It has dozens of active ads on Facebook, serving as both fund-raising ads and caustic attacks against Mr. Biden. Over the past week, the Trump campaign spent nearly $4.8 million on the platform — $575,000 on Wednesday alone, the most recent day for which spending data is available.

Still, over all, the Trump campaign’s hundreds of millions in advertisements have sometimes seemed more of a show of force than a targeted buy. The campaign spent $10 million on two ads during the Super Bowl last year, and over $30 million has gone toward national advertising, a tactic criticized by some operatives as wasteful because it’s paying for time in safe states rather than targeted buys in battlegrounds.

Some observers also said Mr. Trump missed an opportunity to take advantage of his incumbency and negatively define Mr. Biden as he was emerging from the primaries. When former President Barack Obama spent millions on ads attacking Mitt Romney during the summer of 2012, his messaging was disciplined. The Trump campaign has not had a similar focus.

“It’s not just that the Trump campaign is behind, it’s that they’ve blown this historic opportunity to define an opponent, and its extraordinary,” said Stuart Stevens, a Republican strategist and former senior adviser for Mr. Romney’s campaign. “They basically had the field to themselves and they still couldn’t score.”"	left

On Saturday, activists in Aurora, Colorado, convened for a peaceful rally and march to demand justice for Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old Black man who died after a brutal arrest by local police last August. The event included a violin vigil, a nod to the fact that McClain was an accomplished violinist who was known for spending his lunch breaks putting on concerts for the cats and dogs at a community animal shelter. Footage from the event shows a group of quiet participants, most of them socially distanced, holding signs and observing as a few violinists perform at dusk — and then the arrival of a group of officers in riot gear, charging into the crowd. According to attendees, the police went on to deploy pepper spray and use physical force.

Images shared on social media show lines of officers in helmets, bulletproof vests, and gas masks marching onto a lawn outside the Aurora Municipal Center on Saturday evening, aggressively dispersing people. Attendees say police used, or threatened to use, tear gas — a chemical weapon — on protesters. A spokesperson for the APD denied this allegation on Sunday, telling the Cut: “Tear gas was not used yesterday. There was pepper spray deployed but tear gas was not used.”

Peaceful gathering to honor the life of #ElijahMcClain turned in a hostile “unlawful protest”. @AuroraPD antagonized peaceful protestors and put people in harm and used teargas to dispurse people attending a vigil. Shameful! pic.twitter.com/HtWS3mxFc2 — Carlos Espino (@CarlitoPlanet) June 28, 2020

Saturday’s events began with a rally and march organized by Denver’s Party for Socialism and Liberation, scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. in the park between the APD headquarters and the Aurora Municipal Center. That would be followed by a student-led rally and another march, which took off from the adjacent Municipal Center sometime after 5 p.m. Violinists — including six-time Grammy nominee Ashanti Floyd, from Georgia, and Lee England Jr., of New York City — planned a vigil in to conclude the day’s actions later that evening, in Aurora’s City Center Park.

According to those in attendance, the event started out peacefully, though many noticed a strong police presence. At around 8:30 p.m. — about a half hour into the vigil — officers in full riot gear began closing in on the gathering. Police “quickly started moving in on just all protesters, getting them to move away and step back,” Carlos Espino, who was at the event, told the Cut. He saw a “smoke plume in the air,” which he believed was tear gas. “We could smell it from where we were, which was several hundred yards away.” Other protesters speculated that the haze may have come from smoke bombs.

Blake Jackson, another attendee, recalled the police assuming an L shape to surround vigil participants, many of whom had simply been sitting on the lawn and listening to music, and some of whom had their kids in tow. “They were intimidating and pushing up against us,” Jackson said, until the crowd had been corralled into a parking lot at the edge of the grass.

“It was a really surreal scene,” Jackson recalled. “You looked to the left to see all of us standing there with our hands up and the violinists continuing to play, and you look to your right and see hundreds of cops in riot gear.”

The violinists played in the parking lot for maybe another hour, he added, moving to the park across the street, where they “conducted a proper vigil for Elijah.”

On Twitter, the Aurora Police Department attributed its aggressive response to the fact that protesters were attempting to “cross the fence at the PD entrance,” where a separate group had been demonstrating throughout the afternoon. A police spokesperson reiterated this claim to the Cut, saying the entire event was labeled an unlawful assembly “because there was a small group of people who were arming themselves with rocks and sticks, who were ignoring multiple orders to step back from the fence who were starting to damage property … They threatened the safety of all the people that were there.” But meanwhile, participants say the atmosphere at the vigil was indisputably peaceful, people calmly exercising their right to assemble, and neither Jackson nor Espino recalls seeing anyone throwing rocks or bottles.

“There were children there, there were families there, we were there to honor and have a vigil for Elijah. I feel like [police] just abused their power,” Espino said. “Why were they depriving all those people who were there to mourn? Why would they break that up?”

iofly2	liberal	Joe Biden will push allies like Australia to do more on climate, adviser says | US news	"Joe Biden will not pull any punches with allies including Australia in seeking to build international momentum for stronger action on the climate crisis, an adviser to the US presidential candidate has said.

If elected in November, Biden will hold heavy emitters such as China accountable for doing more “but he’s also going to push our friends to do more as well”, according to Jake Sullivan, who was the national security adviser to Biden when he was vice-president and is now in the candidate’s inner circle.

In a wide-ranging podcast interview with the Sydney-based Lowy Institute, Sullivan also signalled that Biden would work closely with Australia and other regional allies in responding to the challenges posed by the rise of China.

While Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, is likely to welcome the pledge of US coordination with allies on regional security issues, there may be unease in government ranks about the potential for tough conversations about Australia’s climate policies.

The Coalition government has resisted calls to embrace a target of net-zero emissions by 2050 and it proposes to use Kyoto carryover credits to meet Australia’s 2030 emission reductions pledge. Some Coalition backbenchers still openly dispute climate science.

Sullivan said climate change would be a big priority for Biden, both in domestic policy – with climate and clean energy issues placed at the heart of his economic recovery visions – and in foreign policy, where he would do more than just reverse Donald Trump’s decision to abandon the Paris agreement.

“He has said right out of the gate, we’re not just rejoining Paris – we are going to rally the nations of the world to get everyone to up their game, to elevate their ambition, to do more,” Sullivan told the Lowy Institute.

“And in that regard he will hold countries like China accountable for doing more but he’s also going to push our friends to do more as well and to step up and fulfil their responsibilities to what is fundamentally a global problem, that every country needs to be participating in and contributing to.”

05:31 Why Trump abandoning the climate fight puts the planet in even more danger – video explainer

Sullivan said there was “no reason it has to get awkward” for countries like Australia.

“The vice-president is not going to come to play games around that issue if he’s fortunate enough to be elected. He’ll lay it out in the way only Joe Biden can do – just plain and straight, down the line, respectful – but he’s not going to pull any punches on it.”

Sullivan made the remarks in an interview with Michael Fullilove, the executive director of the Lowy Institute, who told Guardian Australia last month that climate was likely to “come roaring back as an issue in US foreign policy under a Biden administration” and that it “may be harder to say no to a Biden administration”.

Biden has vowed to put the US on “an irreversible path to achieve net-zero emissions, economy-wide” by 2050, and to rally the rest of the world to meet the climate threat – indicating that he would “fully integrate climate change” into US foreign policy and national security strategies, as well as its approach to trade.

The economist Ross Garnaut has also speculated that a Biden win could lead to Australia being placed “in the naughty corner” on climate policy.

More broadly, Sullivan said Biden would be “eager to develop a really strong relationship” with Morrison – who has formed close working ties with Trump, even though the Australian government has emphasised points of difference from time to time.

Sullivan said Biden had a deep respect for Australia and its contributions to US security and the history of the alliance between the two countries.

Biden and Morrison were likely to “get off to a strong start” because the former vice-president saw Australia as the kind of partner that was central to a finding successful strategies when faced with a range of issues in a fast-changing world.

Sullivan said Biden put like-minded democratic allies at the heart of his foreign policy, because he believed that was the platform upon which the US could most effectively deal with great power competition and transnational challenges.

“Allies are going to have pride of place in the hierarchy of priorities in a Biden administration foreign policy,” Sullivan said. He said allies including Australia, Japan, South Korea and Nato were important not just on regional issues but more broadly.

“And yes, the rise of China is at or near the top of the list of big global challenges that we all have to be working effectively together on.”"	left

mu9mwm	liberal	Roger Stone Quit Paying His Taxes Because DEEP STATE	"Let’s stipulate from the outset that Roger Stone has already admitted he owes money to Uncle Sam. Donald Trump’s longtime buddy is currently howling about “politically motivated charges,” but in May of 2017, he entered into an agreement with the IRS to start chipping away at $1.5 million in unpaid taxes through monthly payments of $19,485.

It was only after he got indicted in 2019 for lying to Congress that he quit paying. That was right about the time he “sold” his personal residence to a family trust. Only the family trust had no assets, so it needed an infusion of cash from an LLC of which Stone, his wife, and his son were the only members and which the family used as a clearinghouse for personal bills.

Sponsored Virtual Collaboration Tools For Lawyers Learn the new standard for law firm connectivity, highlighting Client Intake, Internal Communications, Obtaining Client Signatures + Countersignatures, and 2-Way Text Messaging tools designed specifically…

DO YOU SEE THE PROBLEM HERE?

On Friday, the government sued Roger Stone and his wife Nydia in the Southern District of Florida claiming almost $2 million dollars in unpaid taxes and penalties, a suit which Stone was quick to characterize as harassment by evil Deep State Democrats.

“This is yet another example of the Democrats weaponizing the Justice Department in violation of the rule of law,” Stone said Friday night. “I will fight these politically motivated charges and I will prevail again.”

Which is a bit confusing, since the last time he “prevailed” by getting a presidential pardon after being convicted by a jury of his peers — and that option looks somewhat less likely today than it did a year ago.

But the government’s case isn’t at all confusing. Stone and his wife acknowledged the debt in May of 2017 and began making payments out of a Wells Fargo account in the name of Drake Ventures, LLC, of which Nydia Stone is the only member. They also deposited personal checks directly into the LLC and used the funds to pay “a substantial amount of their personal expenses, including groceries, dentist bills, spas, salons, clothing and restaurant expenses,” which may not be illegal, but it’s not going to win you any points if you’re trying to argue the LLC is a separate legal entity.

As the government writes:

There is a unity of interest between the Stones and Drake Ventures, which does not exist as a distinct entity. Rather, Drake Ventures exists as a vehicle to receive income that belongs to the Stones and pay their personal expenses. Indeed, the Stones treat Drake Ventures’ assets as their own.

In January of 2019, Stone was indicted for lying to Congress, and the couple faced mounting legal bills. At that point, they established the Bertran Family Revocable Trust, of which Nydia Stone is both the sole grantor and sole trustee. The Trust then secured a mortgage to purchase the Stone’s Fort Lauderdale condo using $140,000 transferred from the LLC as a down payment. The LLC also transferred $70,000 to the attorney handling the transfer.

The IRS characterizes this as a sham transaction, shuffling the Stones’ personal residence from one pocket to another in an effort to “shield their personal income from enforced collection and fund a lavish lifestyle despite owing nearly $2 million in unpaid taxes, interest and penalties.”

The Stones intended to defraud the United States by maintaining their assets in Drake Ventures’ accounts, which they completely controlled, and using these assets to purchase the Stone Residence in the name of the Bertran Trust.

If the government’s account is correct, the Stones’ conduct was pretty brazen. It’s hard to escape the conclusion that they put all their chips on executive action that would not only wipe out Roger Stone’s criminal perjury and witness tampering convictions, but expunge the couple’s tax liability as well.

And while Stone is yammering about weaponizing the Justice Department, there’s a strange reference to a release of the original lien on July 8, 2020, just two days before then-President Trump commuted his sentence.

On July 8, 2020, a Certificate of Release of Federal Tax Lien (file no. 2020 R 374146) and Revocation of Release of Federal Tax Lien (file no. 2020 R 374043) were filed in reference to the NFTL with file no. 2010 R 719422. On August 27, 2020, a Revocation of Release of Federal Tax Lien (file no. 2020 R 481201) were filed in reference to this NFTL.

You know, in case the Justice Department revoking its own sentencing recommendation after Bill Barr lost his shit wasn’t strange enough.

In the end, Stone got a full pardon in December of 2020 for all his convictions. But his old buddy Donald Trump failed to do anything about the tax case, so now the OG ratf*cker may be SOL.

You love to see it.

lq6j3g	liberal	Georgia bishop says state GOP's elections bill is an 'attempt to suppress the Black vote'	"Bishop Reginald Thomas Jackson issued a fiery rebuke Monday of a sweeping elections-related bill filed by Georgia Republicans last week, which he called “another attempt to suppress the Black vote” after the formerly red state went blue in the presidential election and last month’s Senate runoffs.

Jackson, presiding prelate of the Sixth Episcopal District of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, which includes more than 500 churches in the Peach State, condemned H.B. 531 during a hearing hosted by voting rights group Fair Fight Action on Monday.

Among a number of provisions listed in the 48-page measure is a section that would require advance voting for primaries, elections and runoffs to begin on the fourth Monday “immediately prior” to Election Day and end on the Friday before. The voting would be conducted on weekdays from 9 to 5 and the same hours on the second Saturday before a primary or election.

ADVERTISEMENT

However, counties and municipalities would be barred from holding advance voting on Sundays, a day that Black churches in the state have previously used to increase voter participation among congregants with “Souls to the Polls” efforts.

“The Black church has always been engaged in trying to get our people to vote,” Jackson said. “So we used 'Souls to the Polls' as a means particularly to get our seniors and other members of our congregations to vote, to gather for worship and following worship to go to the polls to cast our ballot.”

Jackson said the new bill “is nothing more than another attempt to suppress the Black vote.”



“Let’s just be honest: This bill is racist,” he continued, before taking aim at arguments Republican legislators have made in recent weeks claiming that the new election bills following Democratic victories are aimed at increasing security.

“They say that they are presenting this legislation because the citizens of Georgia do not have confidence in the election, that there is suspicion, that there was a lot of fraud in the voting,” he said, referring to November's presidential contest.

“There were three recounts. There’s been an audit. There was court case after court case. All three recounts didn’t change the outcome. The audit didn’t change the outcome. Every single court case was dismissed because they were without merit and had no evidence of fraud,” Jackson said.

“If Republicans had won, not one single bill dealing with voting would’ve been introduced into this legislative session,” he added.

Another bill that was passed by a state Senate subcommittee in a party-line vote last week sought to stop no-excuse absentee voting in the state after it saw record absentee turnout in November.

In addition to restricting the days residents can vote early in the state, H.B. 531 would also further limit when a voter will be able to request an absentee ballot and when elections officials can send them to voters, according to Georgia Public Broadcasting (GPB).

Former President Trump Donald TrumpTrump's Facebook ban to stay in place, board rules Trump allies launching nonprofit focused on voter fraud DOJ asks for outside lawyer to review Giuliani evidence MORE and other Republicans drew widespread criticism in recent months for repeating unfounded conspiracy theories about widespread voter fraud following his defeat in November.

""It was these very same Republicans who passed these laws a few years ago that provided for absentee ballot, that provided for early voting, that provided for ballot boxes,"" Jackson said. ""These very same Republicans, when it worked for them, it was nothing wrong with them. But now that Blacks and people of color are using these processes to vote, that’s why now they say we’ve got to stop it.""

Hillary Holley, a spokeswoman for Fair Fight Action, called Republicans' measure “a massive voter suppression bill” during the organization’s hearing on the legislation on Monday and said “they left voting rights organizations and elections officials on both sides of the aisle with only a few hours to review.”

Holley added that is part of the reason why Fair Fight Action ""has decided to hold daily hearings so members of the public, members of the press and Georgia legislators can really have the opportunity to understand what is in this bill.""

The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. and the Southern Poverty Law Center also submitted testimony in the Georgia House of Representatives Special Committee on Election Integrity, where H.B. 531 was introduced, according to GPB, on Friday to express opposition “in the strongest possible terms” to the measure.

The bill, the groups said in the testimony, is “poised to create unnecessary barriers and burdens on voters that disproportionately impact racial minority, low-income, elderly, rural, disabled and/or student voters—rather than foster ways to expand political participation on the heels of ever-grown participation by Georgians in elections.”

The measure, they noted, also “tellingly” comes “in the wake of a historic election in which Black Georgians comprised 30.3% of absentee voters, and a total of 36.7% of voters by mail were Georgians of color; where more than 17% of absentee voters were under thirty-five years old.”

In addition to opposing the bill’s provision limiting the days Georgia residents can vote early, the groups also focuses on another provision proposing photo identification requirements for absentee voting — a practice they note has had a “disparate impact” on “historically disenfranchised groups.”

“If passed, the prospect of these provisions, combined with the photo ID requirement, pose an intolerable and discriminatory obstacle to accessing the ballot box for Georgia voters, especially to voters of color,” the groups added."	left
lejr9s	liberal	Biden says Trump should not receive intelligence briefings due to his 'erratic behavior'	"President Joe Biden said that former President Donald Trump should not receive intelligence briefings even though they typically have been given to other former presidents.

Biden told CBS News in an interview that Trump was ""unfit to be president"" and his ""erratic behavior"" is why he should not have access to the nation's classified information.

""I think not,"" Biden said when asked if Trump should receive intelligence briefings. ""Because of his erratic behavior unrelated to the insurrection.""

“You’ve called him an existential threat. You’ve called him dangerous. You’ve called him reckless,” CBS News' Norah O”Donnell said to Biden in a clip released Friday.

""Yeah, I have. And I believe it,"" Biden responded.

Biden added, ""I just think that there is no need for him to have the intelligence briefings. What value is giving him an intelligence briefing? What impact does he have at all, other than the fact he might slip and say something?""

In 2018, President Trump stripped the security clearance of former CIA director John Brennan, which ignited a firestorm of criticism that the president was punishing high-profile critics.

“The President was expressing his concern about former President Trump receiving access to sensitive intelligence, but he also has deep trust in his own intelligence team to make a determination about how to provide intelligence information if at any point former President Trump requests a briefing,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in an emailed statement.

Biden, a former Senator from Delaware, did not comment on how he would vote in Trump's upcoming Senate impeachment trial for allegedly inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, but said he is focused on pushing his aid package through Congress, including a new round of stimulus checks and raising the minimum wage.

""Look, I ran like hell to defeat him because I thought he was unfit to be president. I've watched what everybody else watched, what happened when that crew invaded the United States Congress. But I'm not in the Senate now. I'll let the Senate make that decision,"" he said."	left

la1ehl	liberal	The Black Lives Matter movement has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize	"(CNN) The Black Lives Matter movement has been nominated for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize.

Norwegian MP Petter Eide nominated the global movement ""for their struggle against racism and racially motivated violence,"" he wrote in his official nomination papers, which were obtained by CNN.

""BLM's call for systemic change have spread around the world, forcing other countries to grapple with racism within their own societies,"" he said.

The Black Lives Matter protest movement, rekindled in the days after an unarmed George Floyd was killed by police in Minneapolis last May, continues to shine a light on what it calls systemic racism and police brutality from America's small towns to its urban centers.

The group, which started with a hashtag in 2012 after the shooting death of Trayvon Martin in Florida, has grown into a social juggernaut. It has changed the way people talk about police brutality and inequality.

While there is no way to know exactly how large the movement has become, the organization has branched out with chapters all over the world and held rallies, boycotts and other actions across the United States.

Online, it's what many have used to spread the message against police brutality. And globally, it's being used by many to show solidarity with Black people.

A global effort to fight inequality

Eide, who has represented the Socialist Left party in parliament since 2017, told CNN he saw in Black Lives Matter a ""legacy from both the civil rights movement in America and the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa.""

""The Norwegian Nobel Committee has always recognized a strong connection between racial justice and peace,"" Eide said

In 1964, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was awarded the prize for ""his non-violent struggle for civil rights for the Afro-American population,"" according to the Nobel Prize website

Other Nobel peace prizes were associated with the South African anti-apartheid movement from the '60s to the '90s, including those of Nelson Mandela and Frederik Willem de Klerk, awarded jointly in 1993 for transitioning the nation from a system of racial segregation.

Eide, who held the position of secretary general of Amnesty International Norway in the 2000s, said he received multiple emails and messages following his announcement of the nomination.

""People message me to say that BLM is a violent organization,"" he said. ""I condemn all kinds of violence. However, these arguments were the same when Martin Luther King received the prize in 1964, or when Mandela received it in 1993.""

""It is not a strong argument,"" he added. ""If some elements of the movement may have been violent, that is not a reason to blame the whole movement.""

A 2020 report from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project showed that about 93% of racial justice protests in the US since the death of George Floyd have been peaceful and non-destructive.

""We hold the largest social movement in global history. Today, we have been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. People are waking up to our global call: for racial justice and an end to economic injustice, environmental racism, and white supremacy,"" the Black Lives Matter movement tweeted on Friday. ""We're only getting started.""

Any politician serving at a national level can submit nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize. They are allowed just 2,000 words to state their case.

The deadline for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize's submission is February 1. The winner will be chosen in October, with the award ceremony scheduled for December 10."	left
l3kdf1	liberal	The Capitol Putsch reminds us that it's not immigrants undermining our institutions	"Many people fear that immigrants will undermine America’s economic and political system. That fear has animated opposition to immigration for centuries but has gone unexamined by social scientists until recently. This prompted me and Benjamin Powell to write a book examining that topic in detail. We found no evidence that immigrants undermine those systems and plenty that shows they support them more strongly than natives do.

Hold on to that last point.

The mob that attacked the Capitol in a violent Putsch attempt on Jan. 6, 2021, were virtually all native-born supporters of President Trump Donald TrumpTrump's Facebook ban to stay in place, board rules Trump allies launching nonprofit focused on voter fraud DOJ asks for outside lawyer to review Giuliani evidence MORE and his policies. The most significant and distinguishing policy of his administration was his opposition to immigration. In other words, the subset of people most concerned about immigrants overturning our economic and political systems tried to overturn our political system in a violent Putsch.

ADVERTISEMENT

Many of Trump’s most fervent supporters have displayed their desire to overturn the American political system since before the violent Capitol Hill Putsch of when they challenged the election, made absurd legal arguments, and agitated for martial law based on laughably absurd conspiracy theories. The reasons were so bad that they must be a cover for a naked power grab. Many still denied the obvious because, after all, the president does have the right to sue in court.

But no one can deny it anymore in the wake of the Putsch.

Immediately before the Putsch, President Trump criticized his own vice president to an angry mob and convinced them to walk down to the Capitol building to pressure Congress to overturn the election. Many of them started toward the Capitol even before Trump stopped speaking. Whether Trump intended it or not, it was reasonable for him and his administration to understand that some of his biggest fans would take that as permission to commit violence just as he suggested numerous times before at his rallies and other events.

The mob then illegally entered the Capitol, and some of its members went looking for Pence with nooses while others were looking for Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiPelosi mocks House GOP looking for 'non-threatening female' to replace Liz Cheney Caitlyn Jenner: California needs a 'thoughtful disruptor' Schumer 'exploring' passing immigration unilaterally if talks unravel MORE (D-Calif.) and other prominent Democrats. Some Republicans are now asking for mercy to build national unity in response to those criminal actions, which contrasted with the Trump administration’s zero tolerance policy for those who violate American immigration laws.

When Trump started to talk to the soon-to-be-mob, somebody placed large pipe bombs next to the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee offices. The caravan of Putschists into D.C. carried some “bad hombres” with it who were intent on committing acts of terrorism targeted at important political institutions. Trump and other nativists said that caravans of Central American migrants travelling to the United States were full of terrorists, but they weren’t.

ADVERTISEMENT

The confused military and police reaction to the Putsch has even prompted the Joint Chiefs of Staff to make a statement to the rest of the military that their job is to uphold the Constitution, to reject extremism, and to stay out of politics.

This is how governments in third world countries behave. In our book “Wretched Refuse? The Political Economy of Immigration and Institutions,” we wrote about the claim, often cited by American nativists, that immigrants from those countries would bring with them an affinity for the bad political and economic systems they fled, thus undermining our systems over time. We found the opposite, however, with strong evidence pointing to immigrants valuing our institutions more than natives do.

Specifically, immigrants have much more trust in the courts and legal system than native-born Americans do according to responses in the General Social Survey, the largest biennial opinion survey in the United States. Trump sued 62 times in an attempt to overturn the election results in different states and lost 61 times, likely reducing native-born Trump-supporters’ already low confidence in the courts and legal system. Immigrants also have more confidence in Congress, the Supreme Court, and the executive branch in general. After all, only people with supremely low confidence in these institutions would join a Capitol Hill Putsch to overturn the election results.

Trump is like the stalker in the famous urban legend of the babysitter. She keeps receiving phone calls from the stalker who is threatening the children. The babysitter is the American electorate and the children she’s watching are our political and economic systems. Heeding the stalker’s calls, she locks the doors and calls the police, sure that the stalker is outside somewhere. When the police trace the call, it’s coming from inside the house.

Likewise, today’s threat to our political and economic system is coming from inside the house, right where it has always been. These threats of institutional degradation don’t come from outside of the country, and it’s not something foreign that a border wall could keep at bay. It’s a threat that was inside of the country the entire time, inside of the hearts and minds of millions of our fellow citizens. The Founders knew this, which was why they created a Constitution in the first place.

Like the babysitter in the urban legend, we only just realized that the call to destroy our economic and political system is coming from the inside. But it’s not immigrants threatening our political and economic systems, nativists and those aligned with them are at fault and it’s going to be a lot harder to fix.

grmh8x	liberal	Consuming Fox News May Be Harmful to Your Health	"A new study produced by business school profs at Columbia and University of Chicago suggests that viewing Fox News is strongly correlated with ignoring social distancing guidance during the first weeks of the COVID19 epidemic and is in fact driving that non-compliance.

The researchers looked at geospatial data derived from anonymized cell phone data and cable channel position by ZIP code around the country. They found that a 1% increase in Fox News viewership in a zip code reduced social distancing by 8.9%.

The study abstract follows …

We test for and measure the effects of cable news in the US on regional differences in compliance with recommendations by health experts to practice social distancing during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. We use a quasi-experimental design to estimate the causal effect of Fox News viewership on stay-at-home behavior by using only the incremental local viewership due to the quasi-random assignment of channel positions in a local cable line-up. The average partial effect of Fox News viewership in a zipcode implies that 1 percentage point increase in cable viewership reduces the propensity to stay at home by 8.9 percentage points compared to the prepandemic average. We find a persuasion rate of Fox News on non-compliance with stay-at-home behavior during the crisis of about 33.5%-50% across our various social distancing metrics.

From reviewing the study it’s not entirely clear to me whether the persuasive effect of Fox News is demonstrated as opposed to the correlation. Fox News viewership is a marker for conservatives. Conservatives are less likely to social distance, etc. But that likely amounts to something similar since Fox is the key source of political information not only for Fox viewers but for the conservative information ecosystem generally. And the study does a decent job finding ways to isolate the persuasive element from the correlation. The authors do note, revealingly, that they are not able to fully distinguish between the impact of Fox News commentators versus the administration officials and especially the President whose views are so aggressively repeated and amplified.

In any case, here’s the study."	left
mp023j	liberal	Liz Cheney Blasts Trump for Continuing To Use Language That 'Provoked Violence on Jan. 6'	"Wyoming Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney ripped Trump once again, saying the former president not only used language in the past that ultimately led to the attack on the Capitol but that he continues to do so to this day.

On Sunday, Face the Nation host Margaret Brennan asked Cheney about former Republican speaker John Boehner saying that January 6th was an example of “political terrorism” and how the events of that day should have been a wake-up call for the GOP. Boehner, the host said, doesn’t understand why more Republicans don’t speak up. Brennan then noted how Trump has threatened to back a primary challenge against Cheney and asked if speaking out against him was “worth the risk.”

Cheney did not reply to Brennan’s question about how her vote to impeach Trump and speaking out against him affects her political career. Instead, she focused on what the former president was trying to accomplish when he incited the mob earlier this year.

“Look, January 6th was clearly an attack that was attempted to stop the counting of electoral votes,” the congresswoman said.

Cheney then spoke about the need for a commission to examine what happened on January 6th and was critical of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s failure to create one, calling Pelosi’s attempt “partisan.” Pelosi has proposed a bipartisan committee made up of four Republicans and seven Democrats to examine the events leading up to and on the day of the attack. Some Republicans want to expand the scope of the investigation to the racial unrest of last summer, which Democrats object to.

Brennan then focused on the news that came from a speech Trump gave on Saturday night at Mar-a-Lago to donors. The host told Cheney that Trump bragged about the number of people who were at the insurrection, complained about former vice president Mike Pence not doing enough on January 6th to destroy democracy and then asked, “Is he really the best messenger for the party?”

Cheney went right in on Trump, saying he’s knowingly provoking more violence and that the party should reject him.

“The former president is using the same language that he knows provoked violence on January 6th. You know, as a party, we need to be focused on the future. We need to be focused on embracing the Constitution, not embracing insurrection,” Cheney said.

Cheney added that the judicial process was put into jeopardy on January 6th and, “If you attack the judicial process and you attack the rule of law, you aren’t defending the Constitution. You’re at war with the Constitution.”

Cheney continued, “I think it’s very important for people to realize that a fundamental part of the Constitution—and of who we are as Americans—is the rule of law. It’s the judicial process. The election wasn’t stolen. There was a judicial process in place. If you attack the judicial process and you attack the rule of law, you aren’t defending the Constitution. You’re at war with the Constitution.”

She concluded, “We’ve got to be the party of hope, of aspiration, of inspiration. The party that recognizes and understands that, you know, that the taxes need to be low. The government needs to be limited in size, strong national defense, those substantive things, not the party insurrection.”"	left

knzcg2	liberal	Secret Service Shakes Up Presidential Detail Amid Fears Some Agents Aligned With Trump	"The Secret Service will be changing up the agents who are in the presidential detail to protect President-elect Joe Biden. Even though it isn’t rare for agents to change when a new president arrives, this time the shake-up is taking place amid suspicion that some agents are politically aligned with President Donald Trump, reports the Washington Post. To allay any concerns, the Secret Service will be bringing back some of the senior agents whom Biden already knows from his time as vice president.

Several recent incidents have led to questions about the political leanings of agents on the presidential detail. Some, for example, urged agents and Secret Service officers not to wear masks on presidential trips because the president saw them as a sign of weakness. That may have contributed to the way in which more than 130 Secret Service officers either tested positive for the coronavirus or were forced to quarantine because they were in close contact with someone who contracted COVID-19.

In a particularly telling detail of how much at least some agents are aligned with Trump, the previous head of the presidential detail, Anthony Ornato, became White House deputy chief of staff earlier this year. He was key to organizing the photo-op in June in which peaceful protesters were violently cleared out of Lafayette Square so the president could get a photo posing with a Bible. Ornato is now set to return to the Secret Service, although he won’t be involved in protecting the president.

The Secret Service declined to comment on staffing changes but insisted that it is committed to being apolitical. “The U.S. Secret Service is uniquely authorized to provide protection to designated U.S. and other world leaders and remains steadfastly dedicated to a standard of excellence in those operations, wholly apolitically and unaffiliated with the political parties of protectees,” spokeswoman Catherine Milhoan said. “As a matter of practice and due to operational security, the agency does not comment on protective operations inclusive of internal decisions on agency assignments. ”"	left

gf0ksd	liberal	Donald Trump Can’t Stop Spewing Bad Science. We’re Here to Help.	"At a Fox News Town Hall in front of the Lincoln Memorial on May 3, President Donald Trump revised the US coronavirus death toll, citing a number significantly higher than what he’d been predicting just a few weeks ago. “I used to say 65,000, and now I’m saying 80 or 90, and it goes up and it goes up rapidly,” said the president.

Confused about what to make of this? Us too. And with new data and studies about the coronavirus coming out every day, understanding how science and statistics work has never felt more essential—and, let’s admit it, overwhelming.

That’s why we brought two people onto the Mother Jones Podcast this week who can help sort through it all, providing tips and tricks for identifying reliable data. Sinduja Rangarajan, a senior data journalist at Mother Jones, has been analyzing data to show how COVID-19 is infecting Black communities at alarming rates, to highlight which communities are the least prepared for the coronavirus, and to forecast when states will run out of hospital beds. “It’s not always clear what kind of data sources are trustworthy or not,” Rangarajan tells host Jamilah King on the Mother Jones Podcast. “When I’m reporting on these topics, I tend to be skeptical of everything, no matter where that data’s coming from, whether it’s from a city or a state or from universities or nonprofits or think tanks or private companies.”

Listen to the latest episode of the Mother Jones Podcast: Subscribe using Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, or your favorite podcast app.

King also talks to Jackie Flynn Mogensen, an assistant editor at Mother Jones, who has been reporting on the medical science of the pandemic, answering key questions on immunity and antibodies and helping us make sense of all those terrifying death projections. Her recent reporting takes a step back and reveals just how complicated all this science actually is—and how, in the frantic rush to get more and more information about the new virus, it can sometimes be untrustworthy or riddled with conflicts of interest. “Science isn’t about being right. It’s the process of becoming less wrong,” Mogensen explains on the podcast. “What the experts have told me is that making a mistake now, like in the case of ibuprofen, can cost lives.”"	left

jtkm68	democrats	Gay Asian American defeats local Proud Boys leader for Hawaii House seat	"Adrian Tam, a 28-year-old gay Asian American son of immigrants, defeated a leader of the Hawaii chapter of the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group, to become the only openly LGBTQ person in Hawaii’s Legislature.

Tam, a first-time candidate, took 63 percent of the vote against Nicholas Ochs.

“It feels really good to know that someone who is openly LGBT can win,” Tam told NBC Asian America. “There was a time when people like me could not win. I’m glad that I can bring that representation to the capital.”

Tam described what was a nerve-wracking election season, from trying to connect with voters amid coronavirus, to narrowly taking down longtime incumbent Tom Brower in the August Democratic primary, to facing an overwhelming amount of hate from Ochs and his supporters in the general election.

“It’s almost to a harassment level,” Tam said, noting that Ochs' supporters bombarded his campaign’s social media to the point where the messages from his own voters were drowned out.

Ochs told NBC News he also faced harassing messages from Tam's supporters and that he was disappointed the two didn't get a chance to debate. He said that he is not racist.

Ochs’ campaign page was removed by Facebook in September for posts that violated the platform’s terms of service and community standards, local station KITV reported. He has been criticized in the past for offensive posts toward Black, Jewish and LGBT communities. Facebook did not respond to NBC News' request for comment.

Tam said part of his job now is to serve even those who directed hate toward him and his allies.

“I wanted our community to come together,” he said. “I wanted to let everyone know that I’m a public servant that will work with everyone. My office door will always be open to them and their families.”

Tam's agenda includes recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, strengthening the nontourism economy and improving resources for the homeless. Hawaii has the third-highest rate of homelessness in the country, according to a 2019 study, and Tam says the problem is especially prevalent in his district.

Brower, who assumed office in 2006, once smashed the belongings of homeless people in the district.

“We needed new leadership,” Tam said. “It was time for change, and I wanted to step up to the plate.”

Annise Parker, president of the LGBTQ Victory Fund, a political action committee that supports LGBTQ people running for office, said that when there are no LGBTQ elected officials in a state, ""it has consequences, both in policy and how young LGBTQ people view themselves.”

“Adrian will ensure LGBTQ people are considered and prioritized in the state capitol and will inspire more LGBTQ people to run and serve,"" Parker said in a statement.

Tam reflected on the record number of LGBTQ and people of color elected to local and national government across the U.S.

“I’m glad that our Congress is slowly coming together and starting to look like the population of America,” he said."	left

These Democrats share a leftist platform that includes guaranteeing housing as a human right and ending mass incarceration

The DSA has upended local politics in this Democratic stronghold, and its wins extend well beyond New York – into Virginia, Nevada and beyond. How did socialism jump from the fringes of American politics into its very center?

American socialist history

The DSA's roots trace back to the Socialist Party of America, which was formed in New York in 1901 to promote such issues as establishing an eight-hour workday and public ownership of utilities like water and electricity.

Writer Upton Sinclair, Christian theologian Reinhold Niebuhr and Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger were prominent early members. But many early American socialists were Jews and Eastern European immigrants – groups that were considered well outside mainstream “white"" society at the time.

My research as a historian of American socialists finds that early 20th-century socialists found electoral success by running candidates who represented the economic and racial diversity of their communities and championed the issues that mattered to working-class, immigrant constituencies.

In 1918 – the heyday of New York's socialist caucus, when socialists held 10 of 121 seats in the State House – socialist politicians were teachers, settlement house lawyers and union leaders. They proposed New York's first birth control bill, allowing advocates to give women educational pamphlets about contraception, and put forward programs to create old-age insurance and rent control.

The Socialist Party began losing members to the growing Communist Party in the 1930s. By the mid-20th century, it had responded to Americans' growing anticommunism with a rightward turn. In 1972, party leaders actually renamed the party the Social Democrats, USA because so many people associated the word “socialist"" with America's great antagonist, the Soviet Union.

The DSA, past and present

Disillusioned, the activist and Marxist professor Michael Harrington left the organization and in 1973 formed the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee, which later merged with another leftist group, the New American Movement, to form the Democratic Socialists of America.

Unlike the Socialist Party of America, which was a registered political party and ran candidates on its own ticket, the DSA is a political group. Harrington wanted to create the “left wing of the possible"" within the Democratic Party.

For four decades, DSA members have mostly run in Democratic primaries, attempting to push the party leftward – on the Iraq War and NAFTA, for example – while endorsing Democratic presidential nominees from Walter Mondale to Barack Obama.

It had some early local successes. From the 1980s to the early 2000s, DSA members were elected to city councils nationwide and won mayoral races in liberal college towns like Berkeley, California; Ithaca, New York; and Burlington, Vermont, where the openly socialist politician Bernie Sanders was mayor from 1981 to 1989.

In 2016, Sanders ran for president. His campaign, coupled with Donald Trump's subsequent victory, created a surge in DSA membership among young voters. The group's median age dropped from 68 in 2013 to 33 by 2017. The DSA now claims over 90,000 dues-paying members, up from 6,000 in 2015.

The DSA's electoral strategies also changed after 2016, partly due to the influx of new members and partly in frustration with mainstream Democratic candidates.

In Democratic primaries across the country, DSA candidates ran to replace older, centrist, white incumbents with young leftists who promised to fight for “Medicare for all"" and to “hold elected officials accountable.""

It was a winning strategy for the Trump era. Since 2016, DSA-backed candidates have won district attorney races from Philadelphia to Travis County, Texas, and hold four seats in Congress. Forty DSA members sit in 21 state legislatures. DSA members hold five of Chicago's 50 city council seats.

The professional backgrounds of today's DSA legislators resemble those of their forebears. New York State Sen. Jabari Brisport, elected in 2020, was a teacher and tenant organizer. New York State Rep. Phara Souffrant Forrest was previously a tenant organizer and nurse.

The DSA's legislative proposals – rent control, free college and reproductive rights – are classic socialist issues, updated for the 21st century. The Democratic Party has now embraced many of these proposals, but moderates like West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin have not.

As in the past, the DSA tends to back candidates from marginalized groups – whether African American, Caribbean, South American or South Asian – who reflect the racial makeup of the neighborhoods they represent.

Angry Dems and DSA infighting

The DSA's growing political profile has caused tensions within the Democratic Party.

Shortly after DSA-backed candidates in March 2021 swept all five leadership positions in the Nevada Democratic Party, many longtime party staffers quit rather than work under the new leftist leadership. But first, according to the Nevada Independent and other local newspapers, the Democratic staffers transferred US$450,000 from the DSA-controlled Nevada Democratic Party coffers into the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which is controlled by the National Democratic Party.

Some DSA policies that diverge sharply from the Democratic party line – such as its support for the movement to boycott, divest from and sanction Israel for its militarized occupation of the Palestinian territories – draw fierce criticism from other Democrats.

The DSA has also been accused of having a “race problem."" Despite running primarily candidates of color, the organization's leadership is largely white and male. Some DSA members say the group silences the concerns and voices of people of color.

After new groups arose within the DSA to recruit more Black leaders, the DSA's national committee announced in February 2021 that it would start an initiative to better attract, mentor and retain people of color.

In the 20th century, American socialism cracked under the weight of infighting and social change. Can the modern DSA survive its 21st-century challenges?

Its next test is in New York City on June 22.

This story has been corrected to accurately reflect Bernie Sanders' political identification. Sanders is a self-described “democratic socialist"" and is endorsed by the Democratic Socialists of America, but is not a member of the group.

jw624n	democrats	He’s not draining the Swamp by firing Krebs he is firing him for the same reason he has fired the rest. No one ever told Donald NO as a child and he is still a child who absolutely cannot tolerate being told no	"(CNN) President Donald Trump on Tuesday fired the Department of Homeland Security official who had rejected Trump's claims of widespread voter fraud.

Trump announced on Twitter he was firing Chris Krebs, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and directly tied it to Krebs' statement that said there ""is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.""

""The recent statement by Chris Krebs on the security of the 2020 Election was highly inaccurate, in that there were massive improprieties and fraud,"" Trump said in a tweet that also repeated other baseless conspiracy theories about the election and was flagged by Twitter as ""disputed.""

""Therefore, effective immediately, Chris Krebs has been terminated as Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.""

CNN reported that Krebs, who ran the cyber arm of the Department of Homeland Security, expected to be fired. A source close to Krebs told CNN he knew he might get in trouble for telling the truth, but realized his dismissal could come soon when media organizations that are friendly to the President started to attack him.

He learned from Trump's tweet he had been fired, the source said, and responded on Twitter himself shortly afterward, saying, ""Honored to serve. We did it right. Defend Today, Secure Tomrorow. #Protect2020.""

CISA Deputy Director Matt Travis, the No. 2 official at the agency, resigned in the wake of Krebs' firing, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. Travis resigned after the White House made clear he would not take the helm at CISA.

In a letter seen by CNN, CISA's chief of staff Emily Early informed the staff that Tuesday was Krebs' last day with the agency, and said the President has designated Executive Director Brandon Wales as acting director.

""A change in leadership is not a change in mission and it is essential that we do not lose focus on the important work we collectively undertake on behalf of the American people,"" the letter stated. ""Fortunately, we have the best workforce in all of government and I know we can count on each of you to continue the excellent work you do every day as we all work together to Defend Today and Secure Tomorrow.""

A source described Wales as a ""career former chief of staff, and counselor, who is highly respected by everyone.""

Krebs' dismissal underscores the lengths Trump is willing to go to punish those who don't adopt his conspiratorial view of the election. Since CNN and other outlets called the race for President-elect Joe Biden, Trump has refused to accept the results, instead pushing baseless conspiracies that his second term is being stolen.

This includes falsely claiming during an election night address that he had already won reelection, that he had won states that were actually still up in the air at the time and that his opponents were perpetuating a fraud.

In the lead-up to the election, Krebs had often quietly disputed the President's repeated false claims about mail-in ballots but went out of his way to not get drawn into criticizing his boss for spreading lies.

But in the days that have followed, Krebs has adopted a more forceful approach regularly posting on Twitter -- often with blaring red siren emojis -- fact checks of the claims and conspiracy theories being pushed by Trump, his allies and supporters around the country.

While his pushback at the President's falsehoods had frustrated some at DHS, Krebs was responsible for a widely praised revamp of the department's cybersecurity efforts and increasing coordination with state and local governments, as the first director of CISA.

He served as one of the most key federal national security officials that oversaw an election that by all accounts went very smoothly.

Foreign adversaries were not able to affect any of the votes, CISA said, and it was ""the most secure election in American history,"" according to them and the wider group of public and private election officials. That was the statement for which the President decided to fire Krebs on Tuesday evening.

News of his dismissal drew quick outrage from elected officials and election security experts.

Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine and co-chair of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, said in a statement, ""By firing Mr. Krebs for simply doing his job, President Trump is inflicting severe damage on all Americans -- who rely on CISA's defenses, even if they don't know it.""

""If there's any silver lining in this unjust decision, it's this: I hope that President-elect Biden will recognize Chris's contributions, and consult with him as the Biden administration charts the future of this critically important agency,"" King said.

In one notably forceful rebuke, Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, called Trump's decision ""pathetic.""

""Instead of rewarding this great service, President Trump is retaliating against Director Krebs and other officials who did their duty. It's pathetic, but sadly predictable that upholding and protecting our democratic processes would be cause for firing,"" Schiff said.

Former DHS general counsel John Mitnick, also blasted Krebs' firing as ""outrageous but not surprising.""

""@realDonaldTrump has made a habit of firing those who are highly competent, have integrity and courage, and stand up for the #RuleOfLaw. To @CISAKrebs: it was an honor to serve with you @DHSgov, and you should wear this as a badge of honor,"" he tweeted.

Ben Hovland, a Trump appointee who is chairman of the US Election Assistance Commission, praised Krebs during an interview with CNN's Erin Burnett on ""OutFront"" as a ""great director"" who ""showed a lot of leadership, particularly in the election space.""

Asked about the President's false claims of massive voter fraud, Hovland explained, ""When you talk to election officials across the country, they're confident in the security of this election. They're confident in the outcome of the election -- that this was a fair election and that Americans made their voices heard, and we've got to respect the will of the people and the public servants that helped run this election and make this all possible.""

Krebs' firing also prompted some notable pushback from Republicans.

Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, defended Krebs' work to CNN shortly after his dismissal.

""I know Chris. I've worked well with him. I think he's a real professional,"" the Republican said.

Asked if he wished Trump hadn't fired Krebs, Portman said: ""Yeah, I think he was very good. I think what he was trying to do in an unprecedented way was to connect with every state in the country, and give them what they needed to protect and have a firewall in place to protect against cyber attacks.""

Krebs kept up the fact check of the President's conspiracy-mongering until the final hours of his tenure, tweeting earlier Tuesday that claims of manipulation of election systems ""either have been unsubstantiated or are technically incoherent.""

He was quoting from a letter signed by 59 election specialists that also said that ""anyone asserting that a US election was 'rigged' is making an extraordinary claim"" and called them ""alarming assertions.""

Firing Krebs, a US official previously told CNN, would ""cross a red line"" and set off alarm bells throughout the national security apparatus.

Marcus Fowler, a former CIA officer who now works as the director of strategic threat at the cybersecurity firm Darktrace, described Krebs to CNN as ""a Dr. (Anthony) Fauci-like figure for election and cyber security, speaking truth to power about the security of the election based on the facts on the ground and the analysis of his subject matter experts.""

""His forced departure at this critical time will absolutely degrade our national security, sends a horrible message and exposes vulnerability to our adversaries, and puts the credibility of the core democratic value of voting at risk of being undermined, manipulated, and hijacked,"" Fowler said.

Still, his dismissal comes after several of the Pentagon's most senior civilian officials were replaced with officials perceived as loyal to the President, and reports of Trump's increasing frustration with CIA Director Gina Haspel.

kxu1dp	democrats	Biden plans half-million dollar scrub-down of White House before moving in	"The President-elect is being extra cautious after a slew of COVID-19 infections at the White House in Trump's final months

Article content

President-elect Joe Biden is planning a $500,000 deep-clean of the White House after Donald Trump’s inner circle went through multiple COVID-19 outbreaks in the fall.

A thorough cleaning of the building is common procedure before a new administration takes office, but due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the Biden team seems to be taking extra precautions.

In October, Trump announced that he and the First Lady had tested positive for COVID-19, along with more than a dozen members of Trump’s inner circle, including his press secretary and campaign manager. Since then, the White House has reported three COVID-19 breakouts, affecting more than 53 people, including administration officials, campaign staffers and close contacts.

Trump has been criticized for not properly following public health guidelines during the pandemic, even after he contracted COVID-19. “With the fake news, everything is Covid, Covid, Covid,” said Trump at a rally in Nebraska in October. “I had it. Here I am, right?”

Trump continued to hold large rallies with hundreds of supporters in the lead up to, and following, the November presidential election, many of whom were not wearing masks.

Normally, the White House cleaning is conducted during the six hours when the presidential inauguration takes place, and it’s carried out by butlers, housekeepers and other White House staff.

This year, the Biden team hired outside companies to do much of the cleaning. It’s unclear whether these additional services will be paid by the campaign or taxpayers.

The services include a 127,249 contract for what was called the “2021 Inaugural Cleaning”; $44,038 in carpet cleaning, and curtain cleaning in the East and West Wing costing $29,523, CNN first reported."	left

gm16u2	democrats	"Biden Now Leads With Most Senior Demographics — Older Americans' Support for Trump Has Collapsed — ""Let Grandma Die"" Proves Unpopular With Grandma"	"There are different “gaps” in American politics, but one that has consistently shown up in recent presidential elections is the age gap. That is, younger voters tend to vote more Democratic and older voters tend to vote more Republican.

In 2016, for instance, President Trump performed best among voters 65 years and older. He also won among those between the ages of 45 and 64. So looking ahead to November, you might expect Trump to once again do well with older voters. However, recent public polls — and the president’s own private polling — suggest that Trump may be doing worse among older voters against former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee.

In national head-to-head polls conducted since April 1, Trump is barely breaking even with most older Americans — and in some age groups, he’s even trailing Biden by as much as 1.4 points (see 45- to 64-year-olds). (Pollsters don’t all use the same age brackets, so there is some overlap in the different age categories.)

Trump is polling worse with older voters than in 2016 Comparison of Donald Trump’s 2016 vote margin and the average margin in national head-to-head polls between Trump and Joe Biden since April 1, by different age groups Age group Trump 2016 margin Trump 2020 margin Difference 45 to 64 +4.0 -1.4 -5.4 50 to 64 +5.8 +0.6 -5.2 55+ +9.9 -0.4 -10.3 65+ +13.3 -1.0 -14.3 Polls were averaged by pollster to avoid overweighting one pollster. Source: Cooperative Congressional Election Study, Polls

The most startling shift, though, is among voters age 65 and older. Four years ago, Trump bested Hillary Clinton by 13 points, 55 percent to 42 percent, according to the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, a survey of more than 60,000 voters organized by Harvard University and administered by YouGov. But now Biden narrowly leads Trump 48 percent to 47 percent, based on an average of 48 national polls that included that age group. If those figures hold until November, they would represent a seismic shift in the voting behavior of America’s oldest voters.

The last Democratic nominee who won voters 65 and older was Al Gore in 2000, according to national exit poll data. But at the time, that was the trend. Older Americans — those who came of age during the Great Depression and New Deal era, a period in which the Democratic Party was dominant — were disproportionately Democratic-leaning in the late 1990s and early 2000s. And political science has found evidence that party loyalties developed at a young age can persist over the course of a person’s life.

But it’s not just among voters 65 and older where Trump is slipping. He’s also fallen almost as far among voters 55 and older. Trump is essentially tied with Biden among that age group, even after winning these voters by 10 points in 2016, 53 percent to 43 percent, according to the CCES. Trump’s numbers have also fallen with 45- to 64-year-olds, as well as 50- to 64-year-olds (an alternate category employed by many pollsters), but the last Democrat to win 45- to 64-year-olds was Barack Obama in 2008 — albeit barely, 50 percent to 49 percent.

We don’t have as much state-level polling to work with, but there’s evidence that Biden is also doing better with older voters in some key swing states. Take two recent surveys from Florida, a state with one of the oldest populations in the country. A Fox News poll from mid-April found Biden with a slim 3-point lead over Trump and running even among voters 45 and older, while a Quinnipiac University survey from the same period found Biden up 4 points overall in Florida and leading Trump 52 percent to 42 percent among voters 65 and older. If this holds, this would represent a big swing from 2016, when Trump won Florida voters 45 and older by 13 points, and those 65 and older by 22 points, according to the CCES.

But that’s a big if. Polls can — and will — shift between now and Election Day. We averaged a large number of national polls in our analysis (54 in total), but there was still a wide range in the margins from pollster to pollster. Part of that comes down to the challenges of estimating data for subgroups — like different age groups — which have smaller sample sizes and larger margins of error. But there were also sizable differences from pollster to pollster, even those using large sample sizes. For instance, in early April, the Pew Research Center found Biden trailing Trump by 9 points among those 65 and older, more in line with Trump’s 2016 margin. But throughout April and early May, Morning Consult found Biden and Trump about tied, on average, among that same age group. Democrats also tend to poll better among registered voters than among likely voters, the group most pollsters are interviewing now, so Biden’s overall lead might be smaller among those most likely to vote in November.

Still, an average of recent tracking polls from Firehouse Strategies/Øptimus — one of the only pollsters currently using a likely-voter screen — has Biden up by 2 points among those 65 and older and up by about 7 points among 45- to 64-year-olds. So he holds a small lead, but nevertheless, it’s still a sign that Trump is currently underwater with older voters. Going forward, we’ll keep a careful eye on things to see if this shift in voter sentiment holds. Because if it does, it could have a major impact on the outcome in November.

lhr4oy	democrats	Proud Boy arrested for Capitol attack rebukes Trump: ‘I’m going to prison while Trump resumes his life of luxury’	"A member of the right-wing group Proud Boys who was arrested and charged for partaking in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol has rebuked former President Trump in a court filing, POLITICO reports.

Dominic Pezzola, who was charged with conspiracy last month, is asking the court to grant his release while he waits for his trial, arguing that he has no criminal history and his membership in the group was minimal. He also claimed that he was misled by the former president and was swept up in a false sense of patriotism.

“[D]efendant acted out of the delusional belief that he was a ‘patriot’ protecting his country … He was responding to the entreaties of the-then commander in chief, President Trump,” Pezzola’s lawyer wrote in the filing. “The President maintained that the election had been stolen and it was the duty of loyal citizens to ‘stop the steal.’ Admittedly there was no rational basis for the claim, but it is apparent defendant was one of millions of Americans who were misled by the President’s deception.”

“Many of those who heeded his call will be spending substantial portions if not the remainder of their lives in prison as a consequence,” Pezzola’s attorney wrote. “Meanwhile Donald Trump resumes his life of luxury and privilege.”

Prosecutors say Pezzola was among the first to breach the Capitol, accusing him of conspiring and coordinating with others.

hd7bjw	democrats	Tulsa fire department says that Trump’s rally crowd filled less than 30% of the arena’s capacity.	"Just under 6,200 people attended President Trump's rally in Tulsa Saturday, well below the BOK Center's total capacity of 19,200, a public information officer for the Tulsa Fire Department told Forbes Sunday.

Why it matters: Trump's campaign had planned to turn the rally into a massive pro-Trump festival to energize his re-election bid amid the coronavirus pandemic and nationwide protests against police brutality. Campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted last week that 800,000 people had signed up to attend the rally.

What they're saying: The campaign is still celebrating the rally, saying in a press release that it attracted ""over 4 million unique viewers across all of the campaign’s digital media channels"" and 2.5 million livestreams before the start of the rally.

""The news media, which encouraged protestors and bombarded Americans for more than a week with dire warnings against attending a Trump rally, are still unable to prevent President Trump from reaching the people,"" campaign spokesperson Tim Murtaugh said.

""These numbers represent unmatched enthusiasm behind the President’s re-election and a massive audience that Joe Biden can only dream of.”

A Trump campaign official disputed the Tulsa Fire Department's figure on Sunday, claiming the campaign counted ""12,000"" people.

The official did not clarify if that was the exact number of attendees or an estimate.

jvh1p2	democrats	Facebook Charged Biden a Higher Price Than Trump for Campaign Ads – The Markup	"In swing states, Biden paid average ad rates of $34 compared with Trump’s average of $17 in July and August By Jeremy B. Merrill

When President Donald Trump wanted to reach out to older Arizona voters in August with the message “The RADICAL Left has taken over Joe Biden and the Democratic Party,” with photos of Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Ilhan Omar, Facebook charged his campaign an estimated $14 for each 1,000 times the advertisement appeared in people’s feeds.

A few days later, Biden targeted that same demographic with a message of his own, that he had a plan to expand Medicare and cut drug prices. But Facebook charged him a very different price—an estimated $91 per 1,000 views of his ad, more than six times what Trump’s ad had cost.

That price difference wasn’t an anomaly. The Markup analyzed every known Trump and Biden ad purchased between July 1, 2020, and Oct. 13, 2020, and found that Facebook has charged the presidential nominees wildly varying prices for their ads, with Biden paying, on average, nearly $2.50 more per 1,000 impressions than Trump.

The difference was especially stark in advertisements aimed primarily at Facebook users in swing states in July and August, where Biden’s campaign paid an average of $34.34 per 1,000 views, more than double Trump’s average of $16.55. During that period, Biden also paid more for ads that ran nationally and in other states—an average of $28.55 to Trump’s $20.35.

Trump’s price advantage in swing states disappeared in September, when the campaigns paid roughly similar prices. In October, Facebook began charging Biden slightly less than Trump.

However, over the course of tens of thousands of advertisements placed since July, Biden’s higher average price means he has paid over $8 million more for his Facebook ads than he would have if he had been paying Trump’s average price.

The sort of differential pricing for political advertising that The Markup found would be illegal or unconventional in other media. Federal laws require TV stations to charge candidates the same price—the lowest that they charge any advertiser—for ads. Some states forbid newspaper publishers to charge one candidate a higher price.

Digital strategists and campaign finance experts worry that the obscure way that Facebook determines what price to charge could give one side a leg up.

Candidates who can figure out how to game Facebook’s ad system “get an advantage that other candidates wouldn’t get—because it’s opaque,” Ann Ravel, a former Democratic member of the Federal Election Commission and current candidate for state senate in California, told The Markup.

The Markup’s analysis is based on ads published by Facebook’s Ad Library API and provided to The Markup by the NYU Ad Observatory. To calculate the cost per mille (or cost per 1,000 views, also abbreviated CPM), we estimated the spend and impressions for each ad as the midpoint of the range reported by Facebook.

Neither presidential campaign responded to The Markup’s requests for comment.

Facebook defended its fluctuating ad pricing to The Markup. “This article reflects a misunderstanding of how digital advertising works. All ads, from all advertisers, compete fairly in the same auction. Ad pricing will vary based on the parameters set by the advertiser, such as their targeting and bid strategy,” Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesperson, told The Markup in an emailed statement.

Osborne did not dispute any of our findings.

↩ link Effective Facebook Advertising Has Become Key to Winning Elections

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has estimated the platform will make $420 million on political ads this election cycle. (TV advertising for national and local races, which is much more expensive, is expected to total more than $7 billion.)

Collectively, Biden and Trump have spent $183 million on advertising on Facebook and Instagram this year, which said they would cut off selling new political ads this week as part of an effort to limit misinformation.

Facebook’s microtargeting capabilities were little more than a curiosity in 2012, but since then the platform, and its vast trove of user data, have become a major part of campaign strategy to badger core supporters for donations and target specifically crafted messages to groups of undecided voters.

“Their platform allows political campaigns to have broad reach into demographics like seniors and suburban women that are particularly valuable audiences in 2020,” Regan Opel, a former Republican political consultant who now works with progressive clients, told The Markup. She also cited Facebook’s “list matching capabilities that give us the precision needed to reach communities that have historically been under-represented in politics.”

Trump’s surprise victory in 2016 has been attributed to his campaign’s use of Facebook for raising money, energizing supporters, and “attempts to deter” Clinton supporters through microtargeted negative ads. One prominent Facebook executive said in an internal memo that Trump “ran the single best digital ad campaign I’ve ever seen from any advertiser.”

After the 2016 election, officials from both the Trump and Clinton campaigns said Trump consistently got lower prices on Facebook ads. Facebook, however, published a chart that it said showed Trump paying slightly higher prices.

Google severely restricted its microtargeting choices for political ads last year, eliminating the ability to target voters based on their political affiliation or voting record, in response to controversy over misinformation. The candidates still bought $158 million worth of ads from that company this year, according to the search and video giant’s political ads transparency reports. Those reports don’t provide sufficiently granular data to calculate CPMs, though Google uses auctions and “quality” algorithms to set prices too. (The company didn’t respond to a request for comment.)

↩ link Facebook’s Pricing Decisions Are Opaque, but Experts Say They Favor “Controversial” Content

Campaigns get charged through the same opaque, complex pricing mechanism as other advertisers, whether political or commercial: a split-second automated auction, with other factors playing a role, including subsidies for ads that an algorithm rates as more “relevant.”

The auction pits potential advertisers against one another each time a user is shown an ad, which means higher prices for ads targeting people whose attention is in greater demand.

In the thick of the campaign, voters in swing states who candidates think might be persuadable are some of the most valuable, expensive targets.

“You’re competing against every other person, there will be an overlap between who the Trump campaign and the Biden campaign and all these corporate brands are talking to,” Annie Levene, a Democratic digital campaign expert, told The Markup.

Digital strategists have made careers out of excavating the black box that is Facebook’s advertising system and gaming it to their clients’ advantage. Several told The Markup that, in their experience, the makeup of the target audience—both who is in it and how big it is—is a major factor in ad pricing.

Our analysis found instances where identical ads targeted at different audiences had very different prices.

For instance, one of Biden’s cheapest ads promised “access to affordable quality health care, for everyone” to an audience of Minnesotans in mid-September. Facebook showed it for an estimated price of $2.30 per 1,000 views.

A week later, an identical ad was shown to one-third as many Floridians but cost far more—a cost of $129 per 1,000 impressions.

Facebook charged Biden $150 per thousand impressions of a “Your prescriptions shouldn’t empty your wallet” video ad, which went to seniors, disproportionately in Florida, in early September. It was one of Biden’s most expensive.

Facebook’s algorithm also favors “relevance,” and based on predictions made by its machine-learning algorithms, subsidizes ads that Facebook considers more relevant. Relevance, as Facebook defines it, is a function of Facebook’s estimate of the rate at which people engage with the ad and Facebook’s judgment of the ad’s “quality.”

Facebook doesn’t disclose the advertiser’s target audience for the ads, nor does it disclose how its algorithms rate the ad’s relevance, so it’s impossible to say how much of an ad’s ultimate price was the product of its target audience and how much was due to subsidies by Facebook. Osborne didn’t respond to The Markup’s question as to whether Facebook has checked for algorithmic bias, political or otherwise, in its relevance algorithms.

In 2018, a Facebook executive tweeted that the benefit of the subsidies was “on the order of +/- 10%.”

But Facebook’s opacity doesn’t stop the campaigns from guessing what is inside the black box.

Eric Wilson, a Republican digital strategist, has noticed a trend. “The ads perform better if they drive more engagement and interaction on the platform,” Wilson said.

“If you’re a campaign tapping into more relevant and timely and engaging topics, which we should always read as controversial, then you’re going to get a better ad rate,” he said.

Facebook’s ad quality algorithms also analyze an ad’s content, not just users’ reactions to it. An apparent effect of these algorithms is that Facebook charges more to show liberal ads to conservative Facebook users or vice versa, compared to showing liberal content to liberals, according to a Northeastern University study.

Responding to that study, Osborne told The Washington Post last year, “Ads should be relevant to the people who see them. It’s always the case that campaigns can reach the audiences they want with the right targeting, objective and spend.”

↩ link Political Advertising Is Regulated—Just Not As Tightly on Digital Platforms

Ravel, the former member of the Federal Election Commission, said that if Facebook is favoring controversial ads—and charging less for them—“that’s problematic for our democracy.”

Some digital strategists have called for tighter regulations on advertising on digital platforms.

“That’s the real scandal of all of this. In every other industry, candidates pay the same rate. I can’t go out to a TV station and get a better rate because my ad’s better produced,” Wilson said.

For now, charging candidates different prices for online ads is legal.

“If the ad pricing mechanism is established based on [Facebook’s] own business practices, and some candidates are better at exploiting the pricing mechanism than others,” then it wouldn’t be an illegal in-kind contribution, Brendan Fischer, an attorney with nonpartisan campaign finance watchdog group Campaign Legal Center, told The Markup.

The calls for regulation go beyond price disparities in advertising. Unlike advertising on TV, ads on Facebook and Google are not subject to federal transparency laws that require disclaimers and disclosure of expenditure amounts.

Wilson, the Republican strategist, has proposed that Facebook change its rules for candidates.

He told The Markup, “Ensure that they’re paying the same amount to reach the same voters.”"	left

lx0udt	democrats	Trump served with civil rights lawsuit for Jan. 6 insurrection	"With two state senators and five representatives out of 213 lawmakers, the New York State Legislature already has the country's largest DSA legislative caucus. These Democrats share a leftist platform that includes guaranteeing housing as a human right and ending mass incarceration

The DSA has upended local politics in this Democratic stronghold, and its wins extend well beyond New York – into Virginia, Nevada and beyond. How did socialism jump from the fringes of American politics into its very center?

American socialist history

The DSA's roots trace back to the Socialist Party of America, which was formed in New York in 1901 to promote such issues as establishing an eight-hour workday and public ownership of utilities like water and electricity.

Writer Upton Sinclair, Christian theologian Reinhold Niebuhr and Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger were prominent early members. But many early American socialists were Jews and Eastern European immigrants – groups that were considered well outside mainstream “white"" society at the time.

My research as a historian of American socialists finds that early 20th-century socialists found electoral success by running candidates who represented the economic and racial diversity of their communities and championed the issues that mattered to working-class, immigrant constituencies.

In 1918 – the heyday of New York's socialist caucus, when socialists held 10 of 121 seats in the State House – socialist politicians were teachers, settlement house lawyers and union leaders. They proposed New York's first birth control bill, allowing advocates to give women educational pamphlets about contraception, and put forward programs to create old-age insurance and rent control.

The Socialist Party began losing members to the growing Communist Party in the 1930s. By the mid-20th century, it had responded to Americans' growing anticommunism with a rightward turn. In 1972, party leaders actually renamed the party the Social Democrats, USA because so many people associated the word “socialist"" with America's great antagonist, the Soviet Union.

The DSA, past and present

Disillusioned, the activist and Marxist professor Michael Harrington left the organization and in 1973 formed the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee, which later merged with another leftist group, the New American Movement, to form the Democratic Socialists of America.

Unlike the Socialist Party of America, which was a registered political party and ran candidates on its own ticket, the DSA is a political group. Harrington wanted to create the “left wing of the possible"" within the Democratic Party.

For four decades, DSA members have mostly run in Democratic primaries, attempting to push the party leftward – on the Iraq War and NAFTA, for example – while endorsing Democratic presidential nominees from Walter Mondale to Barack Obama.

It had some early local successes. From the 1980s to the early 2000s, DSA members were elected to city councils nationwide and won mayoral races in liberal college towns like Berkeley, California; Ithaca, New York; and Burlington, Vermont, where the openly socialist politician Bernie Sanders was mayor from 1981 to 1989.

In 2016, Sanders ran for president. His campaign, coupled with Donald Trump's subsequent victory, created a surge in DSA membership among young voters. The group's median age dropped from 68 in 2013 to 33 by 2017. The DSA now claims over 90,000 dues-paying members, up from 6,000 in 2015.

The DSA's electoral strategies also changed after 2016, partly due to the influx of new members and partly in frustration with mainstream Democratic candidates.

In Democratic primaries across the country, DSA candidates ran to replace older, centrist, white incumbents with young leftists who promised to fight for “Medicare for all"" and to “hold elected officials accountable.""

It was a winning strategy for the Trump era. Since 2016, DSA-backed candidates have won district attorney races from Philadelphia to Travis County, Texas, and hold four seats in Congress. Forty DSA members sit in 21 state legislatures. DSA members hold five of Chicago's 50 city council seats.

The professional backgrounds of today's DSA legislators resemble those of their forebears. New York State Sen. Jabari Brisport, elected in 2020, was a teacher and tenant organizer. New York State Rep. Phara Souffrant Forrest was previously a tenant organizer and nurse.

The DSA's legislative proposals – rent control, free college and reproductive rights – are classic socialist issues, updated for the 21st century. The Democratic Party has now embraced many of these proposals, but moderates like West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin have not.

As in the past, the DSA tends to back candidates from marginalized groups – whether African American, Caribbean, South American or South Asian – who reflect the racial makeup of the neighborhoods they represent.

Angry Dems and DSA infighting

The DSA's growing political profile has caused tensions within the Democratic Party.

Shortly after DSA-backed candidates in March 2021 swept all five leadership positions in the Nevada Democratic Party, many longtime party staffers quit rather than work under the new leftist leadership. But first, according to the Nevada Independent and other local newspapers, the Democratic staffers transferred US$450,000 from the DSA-controlled Nevada Democratic Party coffers into the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which is controlled by the National Democratic Party.

Some DSA policies that diverge sharply from the Democratic party line – such as its support for the movement to boycott, divest from and sanction Israel for its militarized occupation of the Palestinian territories – draw fierce criticism from other Democrats.

The DSA has also been accused of having a “race problem."" Despite running primarily candidates of color, the organization's leadership is largely white and male. Some DSA members say the group silences the concerns and voices of people of color.

After new groups arose within the DSA to recruit more Black leaders, the DSA's national committee announced in February 2021 that it would start an initiative to better attract, mentor and retain people of color.

In the 20th century, American socialism cracked under the weight of infighting and social change. Can the modern DSA survive its 21st-century challenges?

Its next test is in New York City on June 22.

This story has been corrected to accurately reflect Bernie Sanders' political identification. Sanders is a self-described “democratic socialist"" and is endorsed by the Democratic Socialists of America, but is not a member of the group.

lmolbr	democrats	Rush Limbaugh Spent His Lifetime Speaking Ill of the Dead	"Conventional etiquette dictates that we do not speak ill of the dead. But Rush Limbaugh isn’t just any dead guy.

He’s a dead guy who made himself a multimillionaire many times over by targeting immigrants, women who use birth control, the preteen daughters of politicians, the Obamas, rape survivors, environmentalists, gay people, Asians, Latinos, Black people, and feminists. He popularized the term “feminazi,” a word that stupid assholes fling at women who won’t fuck them to this very day. He said that white people can’t be blamed for slavery, as they have done more than anybody else to end slavery. He mocked the intelligence of Black athletes and villainized the ones who protested against police brutality.

Twenty-five years ago, the great Molly Ivins noticed Limbaugh’s schtick of targeting “dead people, little girls, and the homeless,” an act that only accelerated as he approached the end of his life and his own death approached. He spoke ill of people who died of AIDS, of people who died by suicide, of people who were dying of Parkinson’s disease, and unarmed Black children who were murdered under racist pretenses.

When Robin Williams died by suicide in 2014, Limbaugh attributed it to a problem with Hollywood and, by extension, leftism. “If you had to attach not a philosophy but an attitude to a leftist’s worldview, it's one of pessimism and darkness, sadness,” he said on his show. “They're never happy, are they? They're always angry about something. No matter what they get, they're always angry.” Similarly, “Kurt Cobain was, ladies and gentleman, a worthless shred of human debris.” And Jerry Garcia, who died of a heart attack, was “just another dead doper. And a dirtbag.”

Limbaugh didn’t have anything nice to say after legendary New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner died in 2010. “That cracker made a lot of African-American millionaires,” said Limbaugh, displaying his trademark sensitivity and tact.

After 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman in 2012, Limbaugh defended the boy’s killer. Zimmerman, he said, “just loves law enforcement, and he's a self-appointed Neighborhood Watch commander, and he wanted to protect his neighborhood, and he just got a little overzealous and so forth.” And so forth.

The radio host also mocked then-candidate Joe Biden over the death of his wife and child in 1972 and more recently, his son Beau in 2015. “And if you dare talk about it that way, they’re going to be climbing down your chili. ‘You can’t be mean to Biden.’ See, Biden is a sympathetic figure. We’re supposed to feel sorry for Biden. Do you know why? Because his wife died in a car accident, and then his beloved son Beau Biden died from brain cancer. We’re supposed to feel sorry.” Limbaugh then lamented the fact that the media wasn’t adequately giving then-President Donald Trump space to grieve the death of his brother, whom Trump had spent less than an hour visiting when he was in the hospital before he died.

Rush Limbaugh was also a driving force behind a debunked conspiracy theory involving the 2016 killing of former DNC staffer Seth Rich in a street robbery. Despite Rich’s family pleading for right-wing media figures to leave them alone, Limbaugh joined Sean Hannity and others in promoting the notion that the Democratic Party had Rich killed over his role in leaked DNC emails. His grieving mother, Mary Rich, was driven to write an op-ed pleading for right-wing media figures to leave their family alone.

But perhaps the most bracing example of Limbaugh’s complete lack of respect for the dead were his infamous “AIDS Updates” in the 1980s, where he would read the names of gay and bi men who had died of AIDS while Dionne Warwick’s “I’ll Never Love This Way Again” played in the background. He sometimes called AIDS “the Rock Hudson Disease,” after the closeted actor who’d died of AIDS. “When a gay person turns their back on you,” he once quipped, “it’s not an insult, it’s an invitation.”

That is why Rush Limbaugh’s death is the truly rare instance where it is appropriate, and indeed necessary, to speak ill of the dead as people on the right try to lionize a man who made himself very rich by speaking ill of the dead and training conservatives to have contempt for death itself, or at least the deaths of their supposed enemies.

I can already see the angry tweets from the Fuck Your Feelings party, who cannot believe how unclassy the supposedly tolerant left is being by pointing out that Rush Limbaugh made the world worse. But it’s impossible to describe what Rush Limbaugh did in life without speaking ill of him in death. The problem is that Rush Limbaugh was, objectively, a huge piece of shit. That was his brand. To describe him as anything but a huge piece of shit would do a disservice to the image he spent decades cultivating. It would be dishonest.

Limbaugh had a reputation among his fans for “giving it to them straight” or “saying what the suits won’t!” But the truth is that most of Limbaugh’s loud, processed meat-flecked tirades weren’t even true. Politifact found that 84 percent of his statements they evaluated were “mostly false” or “pants on fire.” Zero percent of his statements evaluated by the fact-checking site were rated as “true.” On even the things that weren’t flat-out lies, Limbaugh was on the wrong side of history when it came to almost every important issue. Climate change, same-sex marriage, Obamacare’s contraception mandate, torturing Iraqi prisoners, accusing veterans of being “phony soldiers” for opposing the Iraq war, basically everything to do with the war. His show was full of lies. His books were full of lies. It was like he was trying to be the wrongest bitch on the right wing, a crowded and highly competitive field.

In addition to roaming the halls of American discourse, slamming anybody smaller or weaker than him into lockers like an overgrown bully whose dad never hugged him, Limbaugh’s lies killed people. He told his huge audience of racist great uncles, twentysomething college Republicans who look like they’re 50, and McMansion rage posters with Back the Blue truck nuts on their $50,000 extended cabs that COVID-19 was just like the common cold. Why?

Because he was a terrible person. He peddled the “big lie” that the election that Joe Biden won by 8 million votes was stolen from Donald Trump, a lie that led to an insurrection that killed five people and led to the suicides of two Capitol police officers.

Limbaugh set standards in the ugly, roach-infested corner of the media he occupied. He pioneered a style of commodified white ethnonationalistic sadism. He made his already-tedious listeners even less funny. Hillbilly Elegy author J.D. Vance wagged his finger at those who dare articulate why they did not like Rush Limbaugh, writing that he wished “people could honor a person who changed media forever without being cruel.” But that wouldn’t be honestly honoring a person who changed media by being gleefully, gratuitously cruel. Yes, Limbaugh changed media forever, but he changed it forever in much the same way that a dark brown skid mark changes a pair of men’s briefs.

In addition to all of his purposeful shock-jockery— like playing peppy music as he sarcastically celebrated AIDS deaths—Limbaugh also perfected a particular type of brazen truth-telling: confessing by accusing. Trump’s “No Puppet, No Puppet, You’re The Puppet” children’s nursery rhyme was a poor imitation of some of Limbaugh’s virtuosic hypocrisy. Like how Limbaugh called law student Sandra Fluke a slut for using birth control when he was, at the time, on his fourth human woman wife and yet had sired zero children (after advertisers started jumping ship, he apologized to Fluke). Either Limbaugh had sexually chaste marriages, was infertile, had the best luck in the world with a very unreliable method of “natural” birth control, or his wives had used birth control like that “slut” Sandra Fluke. Limbaugh, who was fat before the cancer, also had a problem with fat people. He called former First Lady Michelle Obama “Moochelle,” to make fun of her weight. Limbaugh famously advocated for tough sentencing for first-time drug offenders. Limbaugh hated drugs, big time… until he went to rehab for a drug addiction of his own. Limbaugh, not exactly a George Clooney, railed against “feminists”—in some cases the raging feminism hard-ons these women supposedly had were products of Limbaugh’s imagination—for not being attractive enough for him. No women anywhere were hot enough for him.

People who are fat, use birth control, are less attractive than average, or have addiction issues do not deserve to be shamed for those things. But Rush Limbaugh, who definitely fit three of those criteria and probably fit all of them, promoted the belief that those things are shameful, but only when non-Rush Limbaugh people do them.

Dead or alive, it’s hard to not dislike somebody who aggressively hated everything I am. Boy, he hated women who didn’t act how he wanted them to act! Hated us! In addition to making “feminazi” happen, Limbaugh once suggested that the way to end abortions was to perform them with guns. Get it? He hated women who were in college. Limbaugh once ridiculed an affirmative consent policy at Ohio State University: “How many of you guys in your own experience with women have learned that 'no' means 'yes' if you know how to spot it?"" In addition to the utter creepiness of a man several decades older than college-age weighing in on the sexual practices of students at a school he did not attend (mind your own business, Rush!), something about that quip makes me feel a pang of pity for all four of Limbaugh’s wives.

Those who took umbrage with Limbaugh’s ghastly media persona were often told they were being humorless, “PC,” or, recently, trying to do a “cancel culture” on an honest, hardworking man who was only trying to put food on his table by promoting lies that have resulted in many, many deaths. But he wasn’t joking. The thing about comedy routines is that they stop once a comedian goes offstage. They’re presented as hyperbole, not repeated ad nauseum until somebody storms the Capitol. If your jokes are getting people killed, consider writing some new jokes.

So am I speaking ill of the dead? Maybe. If anyone should understand, it’s a man who made a career of speaking ill of the living and dead alike. If Rush Limbaugh can read this from wherever he is now, I hope he understands that he was practically asking for it."	left

l8s7md	democrats	McDonald's CEO: Chain will do 'just fine' with higher wages	"Dive Brief:

McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski told investors during its Q4 earnings call Thursday that the company is doing ""just fine"" in the 29 states that have increased minimum wage rates beyond the federal level of $7.25. This comes on the heels of the reintroduction of the Raise the Wage Act and President Joe Biden’s indication that he will boost the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025.

Kempczinski's comments reflect a four-year analysis by a team of economists that found higher McDonald's wages in applicable markets have not led to closures, job loss or increased automation, according to MarketWatch. From 2016 to 2020, many McDonald’s restaurants paid slightly above the new minimum wage to retain employees.

The study also found the company passed those higher labor costs onto consumers by increasing the price of its signature Big Mac. Specifically, researchers estimated a 10% minimum wage increase led to a 1.4% increase in the price of a Big Mac. Per the research, customers did not eat significantly fewer Big Macs as a result of the price hike.

Dive Insight:

Kempczinski said McDonald's is able to balance between ""judicious pricing on the menu … and productivity savings"" to manage minimum wage increases. He pointed to Canada as an example, which increased its minimum wage by nearly 11% from 2017 to late 2019. Franchisees passed those costs onto the menu and ""through pricing, through productivity.""

""Our view is the minimum wage is most likely going to be increasing whether that's federally or at the state level as I referenced. And so long as it's done … in a staged way and in a way that is equitable for everybody, McDonald's will do just fine through that,"" he said.

Prices at McDonald's, which is almost 95% franchised in the U.S., are set by individual owner/operators, so passing higher labor costs onto customers is an effective way for them to be less impacted waves of wage increases. McDonald’s stopped its lobbying efforts against minimum wage increases in 2019.

Public sentiment is also leaning toward greater pay. A majority of Americans — Republicans, Democrats and Independents — either strongly or somewhat support a federal minimum wage increase, according to a recent survey from Public Agenda, USA Today and Ipsos Hidden Common Ground. This sentiment is even stronger now than it was in 2019, when 59% of Americans supported a higher minimum wage. The support for $15 an hour increases with younger demographics, according to AlixPartners research.

""While it’s picked up with the change in the administration at [the] federal level... it's been going on at the state level for the last several years,"" Kempczinski said during the Q4 call. ""So... as this has been rolling into the states, we have seen and developed quite a bit of experience with how this works out.""

Still, a higher-menu-price solution could be a challenge for independent restaurants navigating rising wages. Mom-and-pop operators don't have the scale and resources of McDonald's, and may need to increase prices more dramatically to offset new labor costs. The National Restaurant Association released a statement earlier this week arguing against raising the federal minimum wage during the COVID-19 crisis.

""The Raise the Wage Act imposes an impossible challenge for the restaurant industry … Our industry runs on a 3-5% pre-tax profit margin in a good year — during a pandemic is not the time to impose a triple-digit increase in labor costs,"" the association wrote."	left

hxaszw	democrats	Biden MUST win by wide margin. Please VOTE!	"(Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s refusal this week to say if he would accept the results of November’s election, and his repeated assertions that the vote will be “rigged” because of mail-in ballots, have raised the specter of a disputed election that could take weeks, or even months, to resolve.

Even absent allegations of fraud, the deluge of mail ballots due to the coronavirus pandemic could take weeks to tally, making it less likely a winner is declared on Election Day in the contest between Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. The former vice president currently leads Trump in opinion polls.

Here are some of the messy scenarios at play – and how they might unfold:

MAIL-IN BALLOTS

Mail ballots will likely cause significant delays in tallying results. In many states, they can arrive after Election Day, and officials must open them by hand and verify signatures. Already this year, some primary elections held mostly by mail because of the pandemic have remained unsettled for weeks after Election Day.

Democrats worry such delays could allow claims of fraud to gain traction.

A person briefed by the Biden campaign said the candidate’s staff was bracing for a “nightmare scenario” in which Trump declares victory based on leading the in-person vote count in battleground states on Nov. 3. But in the ensuing days, as mail-in ballots from densely populated urban areas are counted, his advantage disappears in what experts call the “blue shift” - and the president claims the contest is being stolen from him.

THE COURTS

States have varying laws regarding mail-in and absentee ballots - signature matching, postmark requirements, application deadlines - and any could prompt litigation by either Democrats or Republicans over which ballots should be eligible and which should not.

Presidential nominating contests held this year also exposed massive challenges in delivering mail ballots on time, as election officials and post offices were overwhelmed by the surge.

Voters who follow their state’s rules but cannot get their ballots back in time through no fault of their own could be effectively disenfranchised. That could spark legal challenges in states where the race is decided by slim margins.

Litigation filed in individual states could eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court, as it did in 2000, when Republican George W. Bush prevailed over Democrat Al Gore by just 537 votes in Florida after the conservative-leaning high court halted a recount.

The current court’s conservative majority has generally been permissive of voting restrictions. But that does not necessarily suggest the court would lean toward Trump in a dispute over the election results, legal scholars say.

ELECTORAL COLLEGE

Perhaps even more worrisome than litigation is the possibility of an Electoral College dispute, some experts say.

The U.S. president is not actually elected by a majority of the popular vote. Under the Constitution, 538 electors – known as the Electoral College – determine the winner.

In practice, the candidate who wins each state’s popular vote typically collects that state’s electors, which are apportioned based on population. The governor of each state certifies the electors’ vote, which takes place this year on Dec. 14, and submits it to Congress for its approval.

In a new book, “Will He Go?” Amherst College law professor Lawrence Douglas outlined a scenario in which the results in three swing states – Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania – are so close and muddied that both sides claim victory.

The Republican-controlled legislatures in each state, egged on by Trump, submit their own certificates awarding the electors’ votes to Trump, even as the states’ Democratic governors send separate certificates giving Biden the votes.

States have occasionally submitted competing certificates in U.S. history, most notably in 1876, when the election remained unsettled for months. The dispute was resolved only after officials from both parties brokered a deal giving Republican Rutherford B. Hayes the presidency in exchange for withdrawing U.S. troops left over from the Civil War from Southern states, a move that helped usher in the Jim Crow era of racial segregation.

The Supreme Court recently ruled that states could punish “faithless electors” who cast votes for someone other than the winner of their state. But more than a dozen states have no rules against faithless electors.

Under the federal Electoral Count Act, Congress is responsible for resolving Electoral College disputes, not the Supreme Court. But the law is ambiguous, Douglas said, and if the Senate remains in the hands of Republicans and Democrats keep control of the House of Representatives, a split Congress may not easily agree on a solution.

“If you ask whether our constitutional legal system is designed to deal with an electoral crisis, the answer is, it really isn’t,” Douglas said in an interview.

MILITARY TO ESCORT HIM OUT?

Some experts said they were most concerned about the lasting damage to democratic norms if Trump refuses to concede defeat, even if Biden is declared the winner.

Peaceful succession is a hallmark of U.S. democracy. The Supreme Court’s ruling in Bush v. Gore did not end the election. Gore’s decision to accept it did.

Biden has suggested the military might need to “escort” Trump out of the White House if he loses but refuses to leave. Whoever is sworn in as president on Jan. 20 will command both the armed forces as well as executive-branch security agencies, like the Secret Service.

A disputed election could also spark civil unrest in a country already on edge thanks to the coronavirus, the recession and months of demonstrations over racial injustice.

Mark Brewer, an elections lawyer who is helping train Democratic legal volunteers in Michigan, said the best way to avoid an extended legal battle would be for Biden to win by a wide margin.

“Democrats have to make sure this election is not close,” he said."	left

jpu2rx	conservative	AP Has called the election for Joe Biden	"WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrat Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump to become the 46th president of the United States on Saturday and offered himself to the nation as a leader who “seeks not to divide, but to unify” a country gripped by a historic pandemic and a confluence of economic and social turmoil.

“I sought this office to restore the soul of America,” Biden said in a prime-time victory speech not far from his Delaware home, “and to make America respected around the world again and to unite us here at home.”

Biden crossed the winning threshold of 270 Electoral College votes with a win in Pennsylvania. His victory came after more than three days of uncertainty as election officials sorted through a surge of mail-in votes that delayed processing.

Trump refused to concede, threatening further legal action on ballot counting. But Biden used his acceptance speech as an olive branch to those who did not vote for him, telling Trump voters that he understood their disappointment but adding, “Let’s give each other a chance.”

“It’s time to put away the harsh rhetoric, to lower the temperature, to see each other again, to listen to each other again, to make progress, we must stop treating our opponents as our enemy,” he said. “We are not enemies. We are Americans.”

Biden, 77, staked his candidacy less on any distinctive political ideology than on galvanizing a broad coalition of voters around the notion that Trump posed an existential threat to American democracy. The strategy, as well as an appeal to Americans fatigued by Trump’s disruptions and wanting a return to a more traditional presidency, proved effective and resulted in pivotal victories in Michigan and Wisconsin as well as Pennsylvania, onetime Democratic bastions that had flipped to Trump in 2016.

Biden’s victory was a repudiation of Trump’s divisive leadership and the president-elect now inherits a deeply polarized nation grappling with foundational questions of racial justice and economic fairness while in the grips of a virus that has killed more than 236,000 Americans and reshaped the norms of everyday life.

Kamala Harris made history as the first Black woman to become vice president, an achievement that comes as the U.S. faces a reckoning on racial justice. The California senator, who is also the first person of South Asian descent elected to the vice presidency, will become the highest-ranking woman ever to serve in government, four years after Trump defeated Hillary Clinton.

Harris introduced Biden at their evening victory celebration as “a president for all Americans” who would look to bridge a nation riven with partisanship and she nodded to the historic nature of her ascension to the vice presidency.

“Dream with ambition, lead with conviction and see yourselves in a way that others may not simply because they’ve never seen it before,” Harris told Americans. “You chose hope and unity, decency, science and, yes, truth ... you ushered in a new day for America.”

After he spoke, the cars at the drive-in rally — a pandemic campaign invention — began to honk their horns and a fireworks display lit up the night sky. Biden was on track to win the national popular vote by more than 4 million, a margin that could grow as ballots continue to be counted.

Nonetheless, Trump was not giving up.

Departing from longstanding democratic tradition and signaling a potentially turbulent transfer of power, he issued a combative statement saying his campaign would take unspecified legal actions. And he followed up with a bombastic, all-caps tweet in which he falsely declared, “I WON THE ELECTION, GOT 71,000,000 LEGAL VOTES.” Twitter immediately flagged it as misleading.

Trump has pointed to delays in processing the vote in some states to allege with no evidence that there was fraud and to argue that his rival was trying to seize power — an extraordinary charge by a sitting president trying to sow doubt about a bedrock democratic process.

Trump is the first incumbent president to lose reelection since Republican George H.W. Bush in 1992.

He was golfing at his Virginia country club when he lost the race. He stayed out for hours, stopping to congratulate a bride as he left, and his motorcade returned to the White House to a cacophony of shouts, taunts and unfriendly hand gestures.

In Wilmington, Delaware, near the stage that, until Saturday night, had stood empty since it was erected to celebrate on Election Night, people cheered and pumped their fists as the news that the presidential race had been called for the state’s former senator arrived on their cellphones.

On the nearby water, two men in a kayak yelled to a couple paddling by in the opposite direction, “Joe won! They called it!” as people on the shore whooped and hollered. Harris, in workout gear, was shown on video speaking to Biden on the phone, exuberantly telling the president-elect “We did it!”

Across the country, there were parties and prayer. In New York City, spontaneous block parties broke out. People ran out of their buildings, banging on pots. They danced and high-fived with strangers amid honking horns. Among the loudest cheers were those for passing U.S. Postal Service trucks.

People streamed into Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House, near where Trump had ordered the clearing of protesters in June, waving signs and taking cellphone pictures. In Lansing, Michigan, Trump supporters and Black Lives Matter demonstrators filled the Capitol steps. The lyrics to “Amazing Grace” began to echo through the crowd, and Trump supporters laid their hands on a counter protester, and prayed.

Americans showed deep interest in the presidential race. A record 103 million voted early this year, opting to avoid waiting in long lines at polling locations during a pandemic. With counting continuing in some states, Biden had already received more than 75 million votes, more than any presidential candidate before him.

Trump’s refusal to concede has no legal implications. But it could add to the incoming administration’s challenge of bringing the country together after a bitter election.

Throughout the campaign, Trump repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power, arguing without evidence that the election could be marred by fraud. The nation has a long history of presidential candidates peacefully accepting the outcome of elections, dating back to 1800, when John Adams conceded to his rival Thomas Jefferson.

It was Biden’s native Pennsylvania that put him over the top, the state he invoked throughout the campaign to connect with working class voters. He also won Nevada on Saturday pushing his total to 290 Electoral College votes.

Biden received congratulations from dozens of world leaders, and his former boss, President Barack Obama, saluted him in a statement, declaring the nation was “fortunate that Joe’s got what it takes to be President and already carries himself that way.”

Republicans on Capitol Hill were giving Trump and his campaign space to consider all their legal options. It was a precarious balance for Trump’s allies as they try to be supportive of the president -- and avoid risking further fallout -- but face the reality of the vote count.

On Saturday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had not yet made any public statements -- either congratulating Biden or joining Trump’s complaints. But retiring GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who is close to McConnell, said, “After counting every valid vote and allowing courts to resolve disputes, it is important to respect and promptly accept the result.”

More than 237,000 Americans have died during the coronavirus pandemic, nearly 10 million have been infected and millions of jobs have been lost. The final days of the campaign played out against a surge in confirmed cases in nearly every state, including battlegrounds such as Wisconsin that swung to Biden.

The pandemic will soon be Biden’s to tame, and he campaigned pledging a big government response, akin to what Franklin D. Roosevelt oversaw with the New Deal during the Depression of the 1930s. He announced that, as his transition kicks into high gear, he would on Monday appoint his own coronavirus task force.

But Senate Republicans fought back several Democratic challengers and looked to retain a fragile majority that could serve as a check on some of Biden’s ambitions.

The 2020 campaign was a referendum on Trump’s handling of the pandemic, which has shuttered schools across the nation, disrupted businesses and raised questions about the feasibility of family gatherings heading into the holidays.

The fast spread of the coronavirus transformed political rallies from standard campaign fare to gatherings that were potential public health emergencies. It also contributed to an unprecedented shift to voting early and by mail and prompted Biden to dramatically scale back his travel and events to comply with restrictions. The president defied calls for caution and ultimately contracted the disease himself.

Trump was saddled throughout the year by negative assessments from the public of his handling of the pandemic. There was another COVID-19 outbreak in the White House this week, which sickened his chief of staff Mark Meadows.

Biden also drew a sharp contrast to Trump through a summer of unrest over the police killings of Black Americans including Breonna Taylor in Kentucky and George Floyd in Minneapolis. Their deaths sparked the largest racial protest movement since the civil rights era. Biden responded by acknowledging the racism that pervades American life, while Trump emphasized his support of police and pivoted to a “law and order” message that resonated with his largely white base.

The third president to be impeached, though acquitted in the Senate, Trump will leave office having left an indelible imprint in a tenure defined by the shattering of White House norms and a day-to-day whirlwind of turnover, partisan divide and Twitter blasts.

Trump’s team has filed a smattering of lawsuits in battleground states, some of which were immediately rebuffed by judges. His personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was holding a news conference in Philadelphia threatening more legal action when the race was called.

Biden, born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and raised in Delaware, was one of the youngest candidates ever elected to the Senate. Before he took office, his wife and daughter were killed, and his two sons badly injured in a 1972 car crash.

Commuting every night on a train from Washington back to Wilmington, Biden fashioned an everyman political persona to go along with powerful Senate positions, including chairman of the Senate Judiciary and Foreign Relations Committees. Some aspects of his record drew critical scrutiny from fellow Democrats, including his support for the 1994 crime bill, his vote for the 2003 Iraq War and his management of the Clarence Thomas’ Supreme Court hearings.

Biden’s 1988 presidential campaign was done in by plagiarism allegations, and his next bid in 2008 ended quietly. But later that year, he was tapped to be Barack Obama’s running mate and he became an influential vice president, steering the administration’s outreach to both Capitol Hill and Iraq.

While his reputation was burnished by his time in office and his deep friendship with Obama, Biden stood aside for Clinton and opted not to run in 2016 after his adult son Beau died of brain cancer the year before.

Trump’s tenure pushed Biden to make one more run as he declared that “the very soul of the nation is at stake.”

kw2lq8	conservative	Fox News: McConnell believes Trump committed impeachable offenses, supports Democrats' impeachment efforts:	"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell supports Democrats' move to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Trump and is ""done"" and ""furious"" with him, sources familiar told Fox News.

It is unclear how McConnell would vote in an impeachment trial, should House Democrats vote to impeach Trump. It is not clear at this point whether McConnell would vote to convict.

One source told Fox News that McConnell has not made up his mind about what to do about impeachment, and does not see this as a partisan exercise like the previous impeachment effort against Trump.

Another source told Fox News that McConnell told associates that impeachment will help rid the Republican Party of Trump and his movement.

The New York Times first reported that McConnell was pleased that House Democrats introduced an article of impeachment against Trump.

A source close to McConnell told Fox News that ""nobody is pleased by anything.""

Meanwhile, other sources told Fox News that there is ""no love lost there.""

Part of McConnell’s anger, according to sources, is that the Senate Majority was lost to the Democrats just last Tuesday in the Georgia Senate runoffs, but sources said that McConnell is extremely upset about the president’s actions Wednesday leading up to the riot at the Capitol.

McConnell’s office did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

Last week, after the Capitol riot, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, McConnell’s wife, resigned from her post, citing the president’s conduct.

Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., vowed to bring articles of impeachment to the House floor for consideration on Wednesday morning.

Democratic Reps. Ted Lieu, David Cicilline, Jamie Raskin and Jerrold Nadler this week introduced the articles of impeachment against Trump, charging the president with violating his oath of office. Democrats on Tuesday are also pushing a resolution calling on Vice President Mike Pence to use the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office.

""In his conduct while President of the United States -- and in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States, and to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, Donald John Trump engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanors by inciting violence against the Government of the United States,"" the article reads.

The article alleges that before Jan. 6, the joint session of Congress to certify the presidential election results, Trump ""repeatedly issued false statements asserting that the presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials.""

The article claims that before the Jan. 6 joint session the president addressed a crowd in Washington where he ""reiterated false claims that 'we won this election, and we won it by a landslide,' and ""willfully made statements that, in context, encouraged -- and foreseeably resulted in --lawless action at the Capitol.""

The article refers to Trump's statement: ""If you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore.""

""Thus incited by President Trump, members of the crowd he had addressed, in an attempt to, among other objectives, interfere with the Joint Session's solemn constitutional duty to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, unlawfully breached and vandalized the Capitol, injured and killed law enforcement personnel, menaced Members of Congress, the Vice President and Congressional personnel, and engaged in other violent, deadly, destructive, and seditious acts,"" the article states.

The article adds that Trump's conduct ""followed his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct the certification of the 2020 Presidential election,"" referring to his phone call earlier this month with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, where he pressured him to ""find"" enough votes to overturn the state's election results.

""In all this, President Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of Government,"" the article states. ""He threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of Government.""

The article adds that he ""betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.""

""Donald John Trump thus warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States,"" it said.

The calls for Trump’s removal come after the president spoke at a rally Wednesday, telling supporters that he would ""never concede,"" and repeated unsubstantiated claims that the election was ""stolen"" from him and that he won in a ""landslide.""

During Trump's remarks, he renewed pressure on Pence to swing the vote back toward himself. He claimed that Pence should decertify the results of the presidential election and send it ""back to the states,"" claiming that if he did that, Trump would be president for another four years.

Trump’s remarks came ahead of a joint session of Congress to certify the results of the presidential election. As members of the House and Senate raised objections to certain electoral votes, both chambers called for a recess and left their chambers as pro-Trump protesters breached the Capitol building.

Washington Metro police said the security breach at the Capitol resulted in four deaths – including a woman who had been shot inside the building – and at least 70 arrests.

Congress later returned and certified the Electoral College vote early Thursday, in favor of President-elect Joe Biden.

White House deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino posted a statement from the president on Twitter early Thursday morning: ""Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th.""

""I have always said we would continue our fight to ensure that only legal votes were counted,"" Trump said. ""While this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it's only the beginning of our fight to Make America Great Again!""

Meanwhile, President Trump acknowledged that he bears some blame for the Capitol riot last week during a conversation with House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a source familiar told Fox News.

Two sources say McCarthy, R-Calif., relayed the president’s sentiment on a call Monday with the House GOP Conference.

McCarthy, on the call Monday with Republicans, agreed that Trump bore blame for the unrest, which sent Congress into lockdown as they tried to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election last week.

The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The House voted to impeach Trump in December 2019, but the Senate acquitted him on both articles of impeachment – abuse of power and obstruction of Congress – in February 2020.

The House impeachment inquiry began after the president pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a phone call in July 2019 to look into Biden’s role pressing for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had been investigating the founder of Burisma Holdings – a Ukrainian natural gas firm where his son, Hunter, sat on the board.

Trump's pressure campaign against Ukraine prompted a whistleblower complaint which resulted in the impeachment inquiry.

The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats cited as a quid pro quo arrangement.

kd8qaz	conservative	Electoral College Elects Biden As President	"President-elect Joseph R. Biden asked Americans to “turn the page” on Monday night after his victory was confirmed in Electoral College voting across the nation, while President Trump showed no sign of conceding, even as he lost another election challenge in Wisconsin.

Mr. Biden, addressing Republican suspicions that he stole the election from Mr. Trump, said after one of the longest post-election disputes in history that the system worked.

“In this battle for the soul of America, democracy prevailed,” Mr. Biden said. “‘We the People’ voted. Faith in our institutions held. The integrity of our elections remains intact. And so, now it is time to turn the page. To unite. To heal.”

He promised, “I will be a president for all Americans. I will work just as hard for those of you who didn’t vote for me as I will for those who did.”

The Electoral College certified Mr. Biden as president-elect in voting across the nation on Monday, one of the final legally mandated steps before his inauguration on Jan. 20. He received a total of 306 electoral votes to Mr. Trump’s 232.

Six bitterly contested battleground states cast their electoral votes for Mr. Biden, with some electors receiving police protection and Arizona’s delegation meeting at an undisclosed location, reflecting the mood of the divided nation and the frustration of Mr. Trump’s supporters.

Electors in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin all cast their votes for Mr. Biden, locking in the votes in states where the Trump legal team has repeatedly challenged the election with allegations of illegal voting. The president’s lawyers lost another challenge at the Wisconsin Supreme Court on Monday as the electoral votes were being counted.

The Trump campaign also filed a lawsuit in federal court in New Mexico on Monday, arguing that Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver “flooded” the state with mail-in ballots and altered election laws without the state legislature authorizing any changes. Mr. Biden won New Mexico by about 10.8 percentage points.

Asked whether Mr. Trump would accept the results, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany didn’t respond to reporters. The president said earlier on Twitter that his team would be forced “to do it the hard way,” an apparent reference to Republican plans to object to Mr. Biden’s electoral votes next month in Congress.

Attorney General William P. Barr, who has said the Justice Department hasn’t found election fraud on a scale large enough to affect the election outcome, resigned Monday, effective Dec. 23. Although his resignation letter was warm with praise for the president, Mr. Trump had been weighing whether to fire him.

And pro-Trump Republican electors in the swing states also met to cast votes Monday for the president. While their action had no impact on the Electoral College results, Republicans said it was an insurance policy in case a court overturns the election results in pending legal actions filed by the Trump campaign.

Mr. Biden, 78, is the oldest candidate to win the presidency. He said there is “urgent work” ahead. His win was certified on the same day that the first Americans received COVID-19 vaccinations, and the U.S. surpassed 300,000 deaths related to the disease.

“Getting the pandemic under control to getting the nation vaccinated against this virus,” Mr. Biden said. “Delivering immediate economic help so badly needed by so many Americans who are hurting today — and then building our economy back better than ever.”

In Georgia, former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams presided over the Electoral College vote at the state capitol, calling the roll of electors for Mr. Biden. She said the electors were “ensuring that the nation is led by a good man who believes in the soul of our nation.

“We are electors, but we are also servants — servants of a better Georgia, servants of a better future and servants of the United States of America,” Ms. Abrams said.

In Pennsylvania, another state that Mr. Trump won in 2016, electors cast 20 votes for Mr. Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris. Electors in Michigan, some arriving at the capitol with a police escort, also cast their votes for the Democratic ticket.

“The people have spoken,” said Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat. “After today, the results will be final. It’s time to move forward.”

Michigan’s capitol was closed to the public before the vote because of “credible threats of violence,” said Amber McCann, spokeswoman for Republican Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey.

After Wisconsin cast its 10 votes for Mr. Biden, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers exclaimed, “We made it.”

“Now more than ever, our country deserves leaders who will put people first and return kindness, empathy and compassion back to the White House,” Mr. Evers said.

Arizona held its Electoral College meeting at an undisclosed location for the safety of its electors, Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs told CNN.

“We’ve seen increasingly escalating sort of rhetoric and threats throughout the last week and decided to move this for the safety of everyone involved,” she said.

In Albany, New York, former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton cast an electoral vote for Mr. Biden, as did her husband, former President Bill Clinton. They were applauded in the chamber where the voting was held, as the heavily Democratic state cast its 29 votes for Mr. Biden.

The Electoral College voting takes place every four years on a specified date in December. The normally obscure process took on heightened significance this year, with continuous cable news coverage, due to Mr. Trump’s ongoing legal challenges to the election and allegations of widespread voter fraud.

The electors observed pandemic guidelines, wearing masks and practicing social distancing as they cast their votes in capitols across the country.

Mr. Trump criticized Republican Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia as a “fool” before the Electoral College balloting began.

“Demand this clown call a Special Session and open up signature verification, NOW,” Mr. Trump tweeted. He warned that unless Mr. Kemp took action to verify signatures on mail-in ballots, it “could be a bad day” for Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler in their runoff elections on Jan. 5.

Some in the GOP plan to object to Mr. Biden’s electoral votes in Congress on Jan. 6, which is the final step in the election process before Inauguration Day.

Thirty-three states and in the District of Columbia have laws requiring electors to vote for the candidate who won the popular vote in those states. But 17 other states allow electors to vote for the candidate of their choice.

The Supreme Court ruled last summer that so-called “faithless electors” who don’t vote for the candidate they were pledged to support can be punished by the state. In 2016, there were six “faithless electors,” but there were none reported on Monday.

Republican electors in six battleground states cast votes for Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence on Monday in hopes a court might overturn Mr. Biden’s win. Georgia Republican Party Chairman David Shafer said Republican electors met at the state capitol to cast votes for Mr. Trump because a Trump campaign lawsuit challenging the state’s election is pending.

“Had we not meet today and cast our votes, the President’s pending election contest would have been effectively mooted. Our action today preserves his rights under Georgia law,” Mr. Shafer tweeted.

The final official step in the election process is scheduled for Jan. 6, when Congress meets to vote on Mr. Biden’s slates of electors from each state. Republican Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama said he will object to Mr. Biden’s votes, but he will need at least one senator to join him in objecting to have any chance of rejecting the Democrat’s slates of electors.

Sen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican, said Monday it would be a “bad mistake” for any senators to object to the Electoral College results.

“I just hope they realize that it would be futile, and it’s unnecessary,” Mr. Cornyn told reporters.

After the Electoral College’s results were announced, more GOP senators acknowledged Mr. Trump’s loss.

“The orderly transfer of power is a hallmark of our democracy, and although I supported President Trump, the Electoral College vote today makes clear that Joe Biden is now president-elect,” said Sen. Rob Portman, Ohio Republican.

The House and Senate would need to agree to reject Mr. Biden’s electoral votes from individual states.

As the Electoral College vote played out, state legislatures and courts were considering challenges and reviews of the election.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled against Mr. Trump in his election challenge, saying the president’s request to toss out four categories of absentee ballots could not be granted.

“We conclude the campaign is not entitled to the relief it seeks,” the court ruled.

The decision was 4-3, with the court’s swing justice, Justice Brian Hagedorn, siding with the court’s liberal justices.

In Arizona, Scott Jarrett, the director of Election Day for Maricopa County, told the state Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday that the election was fair, dispelling accusations about widespread voter fraud or machine errors.

Mr. Jarrett said the turnout was higher than it has been in 50 years in the battleground state’s largest county, but he pushed back against accusations from pro-Trump lawyers and advocates that poll observers were kept out of the counting centers.

Observers were allowed to see the process of counting ballots, but they were kept 6 feet away because of COVID-19 restrictions.

Dominion Voting Systems CEO John Poulos is scheduled to testify before the Michigan Senate Oversight Committee on Tuesday, fielding questions about election irregularities in the battleground state.

Pro-Trump lawyers have accused Dominion of manipulating votes in favor of Mr. Biden and connecting to the internet, in violation of election laws. The lawsuits filed in several states, including Michigan, sue state officials, not the company.

l1fxyh	conservative	Republican Starting To Think Trump Might Not Pull Off A Last-Minute 4D Chess Move	"Republican Starting To Think Trump Might Not Pull Off A Last-Minute 4D Chess Move

NORFOLK, VA—Edward Chasney is a long-time conservative, two-time Trump voter, and proud MAGA hat-wearer. Although President Trump has had a lot of challenges during his presidency and re-election campaign, Chasney has always expressed confidence that Trump would overcome those hurdles through his secret strategy.

“What you guys don’t realize is that everything is unraveling according to super-genius Trump’s ultimate plans!” Chasney tweeted after the final election results showed Biden in the lead, and again when the Supreme Court denied the legal cases contesting the election results, and then again when the electoral college votes were certified. He tried to tweet something similar after the Capitol riots, but his phone was ruined when he was maced by Capitol Police.

Although he has since been banned from Twitter, Chasney maintains an active presence on the social media startup, My-Online-Patriot-Journal.info. In several posts, he expressed confidence that Trump was somehow going to use military warships to prevent Joe Biden from being inaugurated, during which the truth about the fraudulent election would finally be revealed to all, and that he was waiting until the very last minute to do this “because of reasons which will be explained at that time.” Once again, this was all part of Trump’s “4D chess game against the powerful elite leftist conglomeration.”

However, sources close to Chasney say that, as the Biden inauguration came to a close without major incident, he seemed a little less confident in his predictions. “I’m starting to think Trump might not come through with a surprise victory after all,” Chasney admitted to a close friend.

Suddenly, Chasney brightened up. “Of course!” he declared, before posting the following revelation to his 157 followers: “I can’t believe we couldn’t see it before: Not winning was part of Trump’s victory strategy this whole time… for reasons which he’ll reveal when the time is right!”

krwig1	conservative	Romney rips Trump over Capitol Hill mayhem: 'This is what the president has caused'	"Sen. Mitt Romney issued a scathing rebuke of President Trump after his supporters stormed the Capitol Hill complex, which forced an evacuation of Vice President Mike Pence and lawmakers.

""This is what the president has caused today,"" Romney told New York Times reporter Jonathan Martin on Wednesday. ""This is insurrection.""

.@MittRomney summoned me as lawmakers and press arrived at a secure location



“This is what the president has caused today, this insurrection,” he said w fury in his voice. — Jonathan Martin (@jmartNYT) January 6, 2021

Romney later released a statement condemning the violence on Capitol Hill.

""What happened here today was an insurrection, incited by the President of the United States,"" Romney wrote. ""Those who choose to continue to support his dangerous gambit by objecting to the results of a legitimate, democratic election will forever be seen as being complicit in an unprecedented attack against our democracy. They will be remembered for their role in this shameful episode in American history. That will be their legacy.""

""No Congressional led audit will ever convince those voters, particularly when the President will continue to claim that the election was stolen,"" the Republican from Utah continued. ""We must not be intimidated or prevented from fulfilling our constitutional duty. We must continue with the count of electoral college votes. In light of today’s sad circumstances, I ask my colleagues: Do we weigh our own political fortunes more heavily than we weigh the strength of our Republic, the strength of our democracy, and the cause of freedom? What is the weight of personal acclaim compared to the weight of conscience?""

""This vote reveals something about ourselves,"" Romney concluded. ""I urge my colleagues to move forward with completing the electoral count, to refrain from further objections, and to unanimously affirm the legitimacy of the presidential election.""

The Capitol Hill complex went on lockdown Wednesday after planned ""Stop the Steal"" protests devolved into a violent breach of the congressional building — smashing windows, breaking into offices, looting rooms, and forcing an evacuation of Vice President Mike Pence and lawmakers as staff and reporters were told to shelter in place.

At least four protests were scheduled in Washington, D.C., for Wednesday, the day Congress was expected to count the votes of the Electoral College and certify President-elect Joe Biden's victory. Trump and many of his political supporters, including Roger Stone and George Papadopoulos, attended the protests, which turned into a storming of Capitol Hill.

Trump repeatedly stoked the chaos throughout the day, repeating claims of widespread voter fraud and telling his supporters ""we will never give up"" and ""we will never concede."" Those claims have been rejected by state and federal officials, and Trump's and his allies' legal challenges in court have largely been failures.

After the Capitol building was breached, Trump made several appeals for law and order and asked his supporters for peace.

National Guard troops, the U.S. Marshals, and state troops from Maryland and Virginia have been activated and deployed to the capital.

On Tuesday evening, videos emerged of Trump supporters confronting Romney at an airport and while he was on a plane to Washington asking him why he wasn't supporting Trump's efforts to overturn the results of the November election.

Romney can be seen rebuffing one woman at the airport, saying he had would not support efforts ""to overturn the election.""

“We have a Constitution, the constitutional process is clear,” Romney attempted to explain. “I’ll follow the Constitution, and I’ll explain all that when we meet in Congress this week.”

Romney was the sole Republican senator to vote in favor of one of the articles of impeachment against Trump early last year — the first senator ever to vote for the impeachment of a president from the same party. At the time, he said he ""agonized"" over the decision and ""hoped beyond hope that I would not have to find him guilty.""

Romney is a former governor of Massachusetts who was the unsuccessful GOP presidential nominee in 2012. He was briefly considered for Trump's first pick for secretary of state, but in the intervening months, Romney has emerged as one of Trump's most outspoken Republican critics.

Violence continued to break out across the capital on Wednesday ahead of Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser's ordered curfew beginning at 6 p.m. A group of reporters were ""swarmed and chased"" by protesters, tear gas was deployed in the Capitol, and several officers have been injured."	right

kbe63z	conservative	SCOTUS rejects TX lawsuit	"WASHINGTON, D.C. — The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday rejected a Texas lawsuit seeking to overturn President Trump’s defeat in four battleground states.

>> Read more trending news

The ruling was delivered in a three-sentence order. The order was unsigned.

“The State of Texas’s motion for leave to file a bill of complaint is denied for lack of standing under Article III of the Constitution. Texas has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections,” the Court wrote. “All other pending motions are dismissed as moot.”

BREAKING: Supreme Court rejects Texas-led effort to toss out election results in four key states that Biden won — Lawrence Hurley (@lawrencehurley) December 11, 2020

Justices Samuel Alito wrote that, “In my view, we do not have discretion to deny the filing of a bill of complaint in a case that falls within our original jurisdiction. I would therefore grant the motion to file the bill of complaint but would not grant other relief, and I express no view on any other issue.”

In a very brief order, the court says Texas lacks Article III standing to sue other states over how they conduct their own elections.

Justice Clarence Thomas concurred with Alito’s statement.

Alito & Thomas said they would have heard the case (they have a belief that SCOTUS must hear *all* cases brought in this manner).

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel tweeted that the decision “is an important reminder that we are a nation of law, and though some may bend to the desire of a single individual, the courts will not.”

The lawsuit, brought by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, was joined by 17 states, more than half of Republicans in the House of Representatives and Trump. It sought to invalidate millions of votes cast in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. All four states were carried by President-elect Joe Biden.

With the filing of its reply brief on Friday morning, Texas cleared the way for the nation’s high court to issue an order on its request for a preliminary injunction, The Hill reported.

A quick decision was necessary since Monday is the day when Electoral College meetings will be held to formalize President-elect Joe Biden’s victory over President Donald Trump.

Trump weighed in on Twitter late Friday, tweeting that the high court “really let us down.”

“No wisdom, no courage,” Trump wrote.

The Supreme Court really let us down. No Wisdom, No Courage! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2020

Seventeen Republican attorneys general and 126 members of Congress joined Texas and President Donald Trump in urging the U.S. Supreme Court to throw out millions of votes, according to The Associated Press. On Friday, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy of California and Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana signed onto a brief backing the lawsuit.

Friday afternoon, Trump tweeted “If the Supreme Court shows great wisdom and courage, the American people will win perhaps the most important case in history, and our electoral process will be respected again.”

In an interview Friday night, Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney, vowed to fight on.

“We’re not finished, believe me,” Giuliani said during an interview with Newsmax.

But during an appearance on Newsmax tonight, Rudy Giuliani, the president's attorney, indicated the campaign's legal effort would continue.



""We're not finished, believe me,"" Giuliani said. — Craig Mauger (@CraigDMauger) December 12, 2020

The states targeted by the lawsuit backed by Trump fired back at the state of Texas on Thursday. State officials told the Supreme Court in a series of legal briefs that Texas has no business telling another state how to conduct its elections.

“The Court should not abide this seditious abuse of the judicial process, and should send a clear and unmistakable signal that such abuse must never be replicated,” state of Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro wrote.

“Texas’ claims are no different than the multiple cases pressed in state and federal courts in Georgia over the past weeks,” Georgia Attorney General Christopher Carr said.

Earlier this week, the Supreme Court issued a one-sentence order when it denied a request from Pennsylvania Republicans to nullify Biden’s certified victory in the Keystone State -- a state the President-elect won by more than 81,000 ballots.

l19aok	conservative	Joe IMMEDIATELY rips up Trump's legacy: New President will STOP building border wall, order federal mask mandate, scrap 'Muslim' ban, rejoin climate accord and dissolve anti-woke 1776 Commission	"Joe Biden's first act as president Wednesday will center around signing a flurry of executive actions undoing much of what Donald Trump implemented through his own executive orders – like stopping border wall construction, implementing a mask mandate and ending the 'Muslim Ban.'

After being sworn into office in his noon inauguration ceremony Wednesday, Biden will put an end to the national emergency declaration at the U.S.-Mexico border, which allowed Trump to divert billions from the Defense Department to construction of the southern border wall.

In a promise to stop the spread of coronavirus, Biden will also issue a mandate ordering mask wearing and social distancing in all federal buildings and by federal employees while they are working.

Biden's team also announced as part of the executive orders spree Wednesday, the incoming president plans to dissolve Trump's 1776 Commission.

Just two days before the presidential election, Trump established the commission by executive order, claiming the goal of the 18-member group is to write a report on the 'core principles of the American founding.'

Trump announced he was establishing the commission following a slew of Black Lives Matter demonstrations – and he blamed the school system, claiming 'the left-wing rioting and mayhem are the direct result of decades of left-wing indoctrination in our schools.'

Essentially the commission was created in a rebuttal to schools implementing history curriculum implying systematic racism in American institutions.

Joe Biden's first act as president on Wednesday afternoon and evening will be signing a series of executive orders essentially undoing much of Donald Trump's legacy

One order is issuing a mask mandate and social distancing requirements in all federal buildings and lands and for all federal employees

Biden will also sign an order stopping construction of the southern border wall – one of Trump's biggest campaign promises to stop the flow of illegal immigration by way of Mexico

Biden will take the oath of office Wednesday afternoon on the steps of the Capitol. The ceremony will not include much of the pomp and circumstance of past inaugurations as Trump flees Washington at 8:00 a.m. and refuses to greet the incoming president.

There will also not be the usual crowd for Biden's swearing in as the pandemic prevails and threats emerged for lawmakers and the incoming administration after the storming of the Capitol earlier this month by a mob of pro-Trump protesters.

After becoming president, Biden will immediately begin work on signing at least 15 executive orders he promised would take priority from the moment he entered the White House.

IMMIGRATION

END THE 'MUSLIM BAN'

'A priority for Biden is nixing the ban on those traveling to the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries – one of Trump's first orders as president, which was dubbed the 'Muslim travel ban.'

While Biden plans to reverse the order, his administration vows to improve screening of visitors by strengthening information sharing with foreign governments.

HALT THE WALL

During Trump's presidency, more than 400 miles of border wall have been built, whether that be new portions of the wall or improvements to existing fencing.

Biden will immediately halt ongoing construction of the wall, but will need to review active contracts and how that money could potentially be redirected.

So far, $15 billion in taxpayer dollars have been allocated for more than 700 miles of border wall. It is still unclear how many miles are under contract and what penalties the government would have to pay if they were canceled now.

DACA IS BACK

His orders also seek to fortify the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, known as DACA, a signature effort during the Obama administration that provided hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants protection from deportation and a pathway to citizenship.

CORONAVIRUS

MASK MANDATE

Biden's team has repeatedly promised to take the coronavirus pandemic more seriously and implement more strict public health measures they claim will stop the spread of the disease.

Biden is mandating mask wearing and social distancing in all federal buildings, on federal lands and by federal employees and contractors. He is also challenging Americans to wear a face covering for the first 100 days of his administration.

VACCINE MOVES

He also shared in unveiling his coronavirus team that his goal is to distribute and administer 100 million shots in his first 100 days as president.

EVICTIONS, FORECLOSURES STAYED AND STUDENT LOAN PAUSE

On Day One, Biden also plans to extend a moratorium on foreclosures and extend the pause on federal student loan payments, both initiatives started by Trump and extended a few times already in the midst of the pandemic.

One of Trump's first orders of business when he took office in 2017 was signing an executive order banning all travel from seven Muslim-majority countries (pictured). Biden plans to reverse that action

BACK INTO WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION

During Trump presidency, he withdrew from several foreign organizations and pacts, which Biden plans to reenter – including the World Health Organization.

The president withdrew from the World Health Organization in 2020 after accusing it of incompetence in its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. He also claimed it caved to Chinese pressure over COVID-19 and lamented the U.S. helped fund the group too much.

Biden's incoming White House coronavirus coordinate Jeff Zients announced top infectious disease experts at National Institute of Health, Dr. Anthony Fauci, will deliver a speech Thursday to the WHO.

In the speech as the new head of the U.S. delegation to WHO, Fauci, who often sparred with Trump over the last year, will lay out how Biden's administration plans to work with the group on reforms.

CULTURE WARS

Susan Rice, Biden's incoming domestic policy adviser, said the new president would also revoke the just-issued report of Trump´s '1776 Commission' to promote 'patriotic education.'

Trump had set it up last summer claiming that 'progressive' schooling had diminished respect for American heroes, and in reaction to calls to remove statues and memorials to historical figures linked to slavery, either as owners or as promoters of the Confederacy.

CLIMATE

BACK INTO PARIS ACCORD

Trump also withdrew from the Paris Climate Accord, lamenting it wasn't fair that the U.S. was funding much of the program aimed at cutting global fossil fuel emissions while other countries, like China, contribute much more to these emissions.

Biden will sign an executive order to rejoin the Paris climate accord, fulfilling a campaign pledge to get back into the global climate pact on Day One.

It will take 30 days for the U.S. to officially be back in.

Biden also will reenter the U.S. in the Paris Climate Accord, an organization focused on reducing fossil fuel emissions, and he will revoke a presidential permit for the Keystone XL oil and gas pipeline

CANCEL KEYSTONE XL

In an effort to roll back more of Trump's climate-related orders, Biden will also revoke a presidential permit for the Keystone XL oil and gas pipeline.

BAN ON ARCTIC DRILLING IS BACK AND EMISSIONS STANDARDS ARE REVIEWED

He also plans to implement a temporary moratorium on new oil and gas leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and review Trump's freeze on vehicle and emission standards.

NATIONAL MONUMENTS ROLLBACK FROZEN

The incoming president also wants to set in motion an evaluation of Trump's cut in protections for some national monuments.

CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACT ON ALL DECISIONS

Federal agencies under Biden's presidency will also be issued a new requirement to consider the impact that fossil field emissions have on climate change and how that will affect disadvantaged communities and future generations.

GOVERNMENT

ETHICS

A pointed order will compel federal employees to take an ethics pledge that commits them to upholding the independence of the Justice Department.

CENSUS: EVERYONE WILL BE COUNTED

He will revoke a Trump order that sought to exclude noncitizens from the census.

RACE AND ENVIRONMENT MARCHING ORDERS

Biden will order a review of all Trump regulations and executive actions that are deemed damaging to the environment or public health.

He will order federal agencies to prioritize racial equity and review policies that reenforce systemic racism."	right
kiif8x	conservative	BREAKING NEWS: Donald Trump threatens to VETO relief bill demanding Congress increase checks from $600 to $2,000 and ditch 'wasteful' spending	"Donald Trump appeared to suggest he would veto the $900 billion relief package passed by Congress on Monday unless checks are tripled from $600 to $2,000.

In a videoed address posted to his Twitter page, Trump said it had ‘taken forever’ to get the bill passed and called the outlined terms a ‘disgrace’.

'Send me a suitable bill or else the next administration will have to deliver a COVID relief package and maybe that administration will be me and we will get it done,' Trump said.

Nancy Pelosi embraced his call, telling the president ‘Let’s do it!’.

In a tweet responding to the video, House Speaker Pelosi appeared to call the president’s bluff, writing: ‘Republicans repeatedly refused to say what amount the President wanted for direct checks.

‘At last, the President has agreed to $2,000 — Democrats are ready to bring this to the Floor this week by unanimous consent. Let’s do it!,’ she wrote.

House Democrats will pass such a measure on Christmas Eve, using a procedure called unanimous consent. Under it, the $2,000 checks will pass automatically - unless a lawmaker verbally objects.

Some Republican lawmakers didn't like the four-figure check idea but, by using unanimous consent, Pelosi and her Democrats have put the GOP lawmakers in the awkward position: if they don't want it, they are going to have to publicly object to a demand from the president.

'House Democrats have fought for months to provide relief to the American people, which Republicans rejected at every turn. Now that the President has agreed to direct payments of $2000, we will ask for unanimous consent to pass a bill this week to give Americans this assistance,' tweeted House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, who controls the legislation that goes on the House floor for a vote.

'It's a disgrace.' Trump tweeted an address from the White House to rail against a bill passed by both parties in both chambers with overwhelming support

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi helped lead negotiations over the $900billion relief package that will send $600 to most Americans. She later tweeted she agreed with Trump

In order to make Trump's request law, Senate Republicans would also have to pass the House measure. During negotiations on the current COVID relief bill, the Senate would not pass a proposal for a $1,200 check for Americans.

Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a liberal star, tweeted her enthusiasm for Trump's proposal, pointing out that she and fellow squad member Rep. Rashida Tlaib have the legislative language ready.

'Let’s do it. @RashidaTlaib and I already co-wrote the COVID amendment for $2,000 checks, so it’s ready to go. Glad to see the President is willing to support our legislation. We can pass $2k checks this week if the Senate GOP agrees to stand down,' she tweeted.

In a rare move, Sen. Lindsay Graham initially broke with Trump tweeting that, though 'imperfect', Congress' relief measures needed to be signed into law as soon as possible to 'save jobs and lives'.

He later appeared to reverse course, voicing his support for the president's critique of the bill, writing: 'Appreciate the fact that Speaker Pelosi supports President [Trump's] idea to increase direct payments to $2,000 per person.

'The American people are hurting and deserve relief. I know there is much bipartisan support for this idea,' he wrote, adding: 'Let’s go further.'

The package also easily passed the Senate, led by Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell. It now goes to President Trump for his signature

After releasing his video message, Trump went after members of his own party including Sen. John Thune and also Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who have both publicly said that Joe Biden is the winner of the 2020 presidential election

House Democrats will vote on Trump's demand for a $2,000 stimulus check on Christmas Eve

Full Transcript: What President Trump Said About Congress' COVID Stimulus Relief Bill Throughout the summer, Democrats cruelly blocked COVID relief legislation in an effort to advance their extreme left wing agenda and influence the election. Then a few months ago, Congress started negotiations on a new package to get urgently needed help to the American people. It’s taken forever. However, the bill they are now planning to send back to my desk is much different than anticipated. It really is a disgrace. For example, among the more than 5,000 pages in this bill, which nobody in Congress has read because of its length and complexity, it’s called the COVID Relief Bill, but it has almost nothing to do with COVID. This bill contains $85.5 million for assistance to Cambodia, $134 million to Burma, $1.3 billion for Egypt and the Egyptian military, which will go out and buy almost exclusively Russian military equipment. $25 million for democracy and gender programs in Pakistan, $505 million to Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. $40 million for the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, which is not even open for business. $1 billion for the Smithsonian and an additional $154 million for the National Gallery of Art. Likewise, these facilities are essentially not open. $7 million for reef fish management, $25 billion to combat Asian carp, $2.5 million to count the number of amberjack fish in the Gulf of Mexico. A provision to promote the breeding of fish in federal hatcheries, $3 million in poultry production technology, $2 million to research the impact of down trees, $566 million for construction projects at the FBI. The bill also allows stimulus checks for the family members of illegal aliens, allowing them to get up to $1,800 each. This is far more than the Americans are given. Despite all of this wasteful spending and much more, the $900 billion package provides hardworking taxpayers with only $600 each in relief payments and not enough money is given to small businesses. And in particular, restaurants, whose owners have suffered so grievously. They were only given a deduction for others to use in business, their restaurant, for two years. This two year period must be withdrawn, which will allow the owners to obtain financing and get their restaurants back in condition. Congress can terminate it at a much later date, but two years is not acceptable. It’s not enough. Congress found plenty of money for foreign countries, lobbyists and special interests while sending the bare minimum to the American people who need it. It wasn’t their fault, it was China’s fault. Not their fault. I am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 to $2,000 or $4,000 for a couple. I’m also asking Congress to immediately get rid of the wasteful and unnecessary items from this legislation and to send me a suitable bill or else the next administration will have to deliver a COVID relief package, and maybe that administration will be me, and we will get it done. Thank you very much. Advertisement

Trump has not explicitly threatened a veto yet, but he made clear in his video that he’s unhappy with the current version, and is demanding drastic amendments.

His demands came minutes after the White House released a list of Trump's latest pardons, including former GOP lawmakers Duncan Hunter and Chris Collins.

And if Trump doesn't get what he wishes, his actions could prompt a government shutdown days after Christmas.

Both houses had easily passed the bill - 359-53 in the House and 91-7 in the Senate - both far above the two-thirds which would be needed to override a veto, but there may not be enough time in the Congressional calendar to fix it.

Trump went after one of the top Republican senators in a tweet after he dropped his video bombshell in an indication he was out for vengeance as he's turned the final weeks of his presidency into a loyalty test for lawmakers in his party.

The president threatened to primary Senator John Thune, a member of the GOP leadership, in the senator’s next re-election campaign after Thune said Republican senators would not support an effort by House conservatives to overturn the result from the electoral college.

The president wants Congress to refuse to certify the electoral college results as part of his attempt to overthrow the election.

Joe Biden won the with 306 votes to Trump's 232.

Trump derisively referred to Thune, a longtime Republican senator, as 'Mitch’s boy,' a reference to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has publicly recognized Biden as the president-elect and quietly urged GOP senators not to support the move to block the Electoral College certification.

‘Republicans in the Senate so quickly forget. Right now they would be down 8 seats without my backing them in the last Election. RINO John Thune, “Mitch’s boy”, should just let it play out. South Dakota doesn’t like weakness. He will be primaried in 2022, political career over!!!,’ Trump tweeted.

A group of House Republican lawmakers met privately with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence at the White House on Monday to discuss a long shot bid to challenge the electoral college results when Congress meets to certify them on January 6th.

Pence presides over the session, which requires an objection from a member of the House and the Senate for the results to be challenged.

Thune warned the effort will get no where with the upper chamber.

'They've got to remember is,' Thune warned the House lawmakers in remarks to reporters on Capitol Hill Monday, 'it's just not going anywhere. It's going down like a shot dog. And I just don't think it makes a lot of sense to put everybody through this when you know what the ultimate outcome is going to be.'

But the Republican with the best chance to beat Thune took herself out of the running. Republican Gov. Kristi Noem said she would seek a second term in the gubernatorial mansion.

'.@johnthune is a friend of mine, and I will not be challenging him,' she wrote on Twitter after Trump made his threat. 'I’m honored to be Governor of South Dakota and will ask the people to give me an opportunity to continue serving them as Governor in 2022.'

Trump complained about Thune shortly after he released a brief video address where he ran through a laundry list of complaints about the appropriations bill, which is attached to COVID relief.

He ran through periodic pet peeves of individual programs that are often targets in floor debates – though some have justifications that he glossed over.

He called out $40 million dollars for the Kennedy Center 'in Washington, DC, which is not even open for business.' The venue, like others is struggling in part due to the fact that it is closed due to the coronavirus.

Hours earlier, Trump named his senior adviser, Hope Hicks, to serve on the Kennedy Center's board.

Senator John Thune of South Dakota, a member of GOP leadership, warned House Republicans their efforts to challenge the electoral college results will 'go down like a shot dog'

But South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem said she would not challenge Thune in 2022

Trump also railed against funding to research 'downed trees' – although earlier in his term, he blasted California for allegedly failing to properly manage forests within its borders.

He also called out $1 billion for the Smithsonian and funds for the National Gallery of Art, noting the facilities are 'essentially not open.'

He also ridiculed $7 million for reef fish management and $25 million to combat Asian carp.

According to Trump's own Agriculture Department, Asian carp, which are not native to the U.S., 'are causing issues in the Mississippi river and surrounding waters. Asian carp are fast-growing and prolific feeders that out-compete native fish and leave a trail of environmental destruction in their wake.'

He also blasted $566 million for construction projects at the FBI – which has been seeking to relocate from its downtown Washington DC offices, located across from Trump's hotel.

He blasted 'wasteful spending – and much more.'

He complained the package gave 'hardworking taxpayers with only $600 each in relief payments' – despite his own allies raising concerns about the impact on the debt of the bill.

Trump also said 'not enough money is given to small businesses and in particular restaurants whose owners have suffered so grievously.'

The Trump administration had pushed for what's being dubbed the 'three martini lunch' provision to be added to the bill. '

Now Trump complained that the deduction lasted for only two years.

There were Republicans and Democrats pushing for larger $1,200 checks. He called the $600 amount 'ridiculously low.'

He called on Congress to nix 'wasteful and unnecessary items' from the legislation.

Trump said he wanted Congress to give individual Americans $2,000 and couples $4,000 in a revised version of the package.

Trump may not have to outright veto the massive legislation, which funds the government for the next fiscal year in addition to providing COVID relief, including the $600 checks to Americans.

The president can instead wield a rarely used procedural weapon known as the pocket veto, which would keep the legislation from becoming law without letting lawmakers have the chance to over ride a formal veto.

The pocket veto would be Trump’s best option given the legislation passed both chambers of Congress with super majorities – more than enough votes to over ride a presidential veto.

Several legislative stars have to align for a president to effectively use the pocket veto – a situation so rare President Barack Obama only used it once in his eight years in office.

A pocket veto works when a president effectively keeps the legislation in his ‘pocket’ - not signing it if it comes too close to the end of a Congressional adjournment, when Congress is done with law-making for the year.

Trump said he wanted Congress to give individual Americans $2,000 and couples $4,000 in a revised version of the package

Lawmakers passed the massive spending and relief package late Monday night - near the end of its current term.

Under Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution, a president has ten days - with Sundays excluded - to either sign or veto a bill.

But, the current Congress must end its 116th session by 11:59:59 am on January 3 in what is called adjourning sine die, which means all legislative business is done.

Any legislation that did not become law is dead and must be brought up again in the 117th Congress.

So Trump could run out the Congressional clock and just let the legislation die because right now time is on his side.

Namely because the White House still has not received the legislation.

Because of its massive size – clocking in at more than 5,000 pages – the legislation has not completed the 'enrollment' process, which is the process it must go through after Congress passes it but before it goes down Pennsylvania Avenue to the president.

In order to avoid a pocket veto, Congress must get the legislation to Trump by December 23.

Complicating matters even more, amending the legislation as it stands now is not an option. Lawmakers would have to start over, draft an entirely new legislative package that would need to be passed by both chambers of Congress and then go to Trump.

Another problem: the legislation also contains the funding for the government.

If it doesn't become law by December 28, there's a government shutdown.

Trump's speech had echoes of the one high-profile attack on it in Congress, when Senator Rand Paul had attacked his own party for voting for it saying they are 'no better than Democrats.'

He told the Senate Monday afternoon: 'To so-called conservatives who are quick to identify the socialism of Democrats: If you vote for this spending monstrosity, you are no better.'

Lawmakers tacked on a $1.4 trillion catchall spending bill and thousands of pages of other end-of-session business in a massive bundle of bipartisan legislation as Capitol Hill prepared to close the books on the year.

Paul added: 'If free money was the answer, if money really did grow on trees, why not give more free money? Why not give it out all the time? Why stop at $600 a person? Why not $1,000? Why not $2,000?

'Maybe these new Free-Money Republicans should join the Everybody-Gets-A-Guaranteed-Income Caucus? Why not $20,000 a year for everybody, why not $30,000? If we can print out money with impunity, why not do it?'

Senator Rand Paul had attacked his own party for voting for the relief package saying they are 'no better than Democrats'. He said: 'To so-called conservatives who are quick to identify the socialism of Democrats: If you vote for this spending monstrosity, you are no better'

The lopsided 359-53 House vote and 91-7 Senate tally was a bipartisan coda to months of partisanship and politicking as lawmakers wrangled over the relief question, a logjam that broke after President-elect Joe Biden urged his party to accept a compromise with top Republicans that is smaller than many Democrats would have liked.

Paul was joined by Sens. Rick Scott, Mike Lee, Marsha Blackburn, Ted Cruz and Ron Johnson in voting against the package.

He said: 'When you vote to pass out free money, you lose your soul and you abandon forever any semblance of moral or fiscal integrity.'

The relief package, unveiled Monday afternoon, sped through Congress in a matter of hours.

When to Expect Your Relief Check - if Trump Signs Direct checks to Americans could start hitting accounts shortly after Jan. 1, now that Congress has passed the relief package. Additionally, the relief could come quicker than it did in the first round earlier this year, as millions have verified their information on the IRS's 'Get My Payment' site. Those receiving paper checks would get their money in the coming weeks. Advertisement

The bill combines coronavirus-fighting funds with financial relief for individuals and businesses.

It would establish a temporary $300 per week supplemental jobless benefit and a $600 direct stimulus payment to most Americans, along with a new round of subsidies for hard-hit businesses, restaurants, and theaters and money for schools, health care providers and renters facing eviction.

The 5,593-page legislation - by far the longest bill ever - came together Sunday after months of battling, posturing and postelection negotiating that reined in a number of Democratic demands as the end of the congressional session approached.

Biden was eager for a deal to deliver long-awaited help to suffering people and a boost to the economy, even though it was less than half the size that Democrats wanted in the fall.

'This deal is not everything I want - not by a long shot,' said Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., a longstanding voice in the party´s old-school liberal wing.

'The choice before us is simple. It´s about whether we help families or not. It´s about whether we help small businesses and restaurants or not. It´s about whether we boost (food stamp) benefits and strengthen anti-hunger programs or not. And whether we help those dealing with a job loss or not. To me, this is not a tough call.'

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a key negotiator, said on CNBC Monday morning that the direct payments would begin arriving in bank accounts next week.

Democrats promised more aid to come once Biden takes office, but Republicans were signaling a wait-and-see approach.

COVID Stimulus Bill Breakdown The $900billion stimulus plan Congress approved Monday would provide direct aid to citizens as well as aid to businesses. Provisions include: Direct payments of $600 to most adults and $600 per child. The check amount decreases for those who earned more than $75,000 in the 2019 tax year, and will not go out at all to those who made more than 99,000

A $300 unemployment supplement while retaining pandemic-era programs that expanded unemployment insurance eligibility. The benefit could kick in by Dec. 27 and run through March 14

$284 billion for government payroll loans, including expanded eligibility for nonprofits and local newspapers and TV and radio broadcasters. This includes $15 billion for live venues, independent movie theaters, and cultural institutions and $20 billion for targeted disaster grants

$82 billion for colleges and schools, including support for heating-and-cooling systems upgrades to mitigate virus transmission and reopen classrooms, and $10 billion for child care assistance

$45 billion for transportation assistance, including $15 billion to U.S. passenger airlines for payroll assistance, $14 billion for transit systems, $10 billion for state highway funding and $1 billion for Amtrak passenger railroad

$25 billion for rental assistance for families struggling to stay in their homes, and an extension of the eviction moratorium.

$26 billion for food/farm assistance. Increases food stamp benefits by 15% and provides funding to food banks, Meals on Wheels and other food aid. Provides an equal amount ($13 billion) in aid to farmers and ranchers.

Expanded Pell Grants for college tuition, which would reach 500,000 new recipients and provide the maximum benefit for more than 1.5 million students

Provides $10 billion to the Child Care Development Block Grant to help families with child care costs and help providers cover increased operating costs.

$7 billion for broadband internet access, including $1.9 billion to replace telecom network equipment that poses national security risks

$4 billion for an international vaccine alliance

Forgives a $10 billion loan to the Postal Service provided in earlier relief legislation

Contains bipartisan legislation to protect consumers from huge surprise medical bills after receiving treatment from out-of-network providers

Extends a variety of expiring tax breaks, including lower excise taxes of crafter brewers and distillers. Renewable energy sources would see tax breaks extended, as would motorsport facilities, and people making charitable contributions. Business meals would be 100% deductible through 2022 Advertisement

The measure would fund the government through September, wrapping a year's worth of action on annual spending bills into a single package that never saw Senate committee or floor debate.

The legislation followed a tortured path. Democrats played hardball up until Election Day, amid accusations that they wanted to deny Trump a victory that might help him prevail.

Democrats denied that, but their demands indeed became more realistic after Trump's loss and as Biden made it clear that half a loaf was better than none.

The final bill bore ample resemblance to a $1 trillion package put together by Senate Republican leaders in July, a proposal that at the time was scoffed at by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., as way too little.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., took a victory lap after blocking far more ambitious legislation from reaching the Senate floor. He said the pragmatic approach of Biden was key.

'A few days ago, with a new president-elect of their own party, everything changed. Democrats suddenly came around to our position that we should find consensus, make law where we agree, and get urgent help out the door,' McConnell said.

On direct payments, the bill provides $600 to individuals making up to $75,000 per year and $1,200 to couples making up to $150,000, with payments phased out for higher incomes. An additional $600 payment will be made per dependent child, similar to the last round of relief payments in the spring.

The $300 per week bonus jobless benefit was half the supplemental federal unemployment benefit provided under the $1.8 billion CARES Act in March. That more generous benefit and would be limited to 11 weeks instead of 16 weeks. The direct $600 stimulus payment was also half the March payment.

The CARES Act was credited with keeping the economy from falling off a cliff during widespread lockdowns in the spring, but Republicans controlling the Senate cited debt concerns in pushing against Democratic demands.

'Anyone who thinks this bill is enough hasn´t heard the desperation in the voices of their constituents, has not looked into the eyes of the small-business owner on the brink of ruin,' said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, a lifelong New Yorker who pushed hard for money helping his city's transit systems, renters, theaters and restaurants.

Progress came after a bipartisan group of pragmatists and moderates devised a $908 billion plan that built a middle-ground position that the top four leaders of Congress - the GOP and Democratic leaders of both the House and Senate - used as the basis for their talks. The lawmakers urged leaders on both sides to back off of hardline positions.

'At times we felt like we were in the wilderness because people on all sides of the aisle didn´t want to give, in order to give the other side a win,' said freshman Rep. Elssa Slotkin, D-Mich. 'And it was gross to watch, frankly.'

Republicans were most intent on reviving the Paycheck Protection Program with $284 billion, which would cover a second round of PPP grants to especially hard-hit businesses. Democrats won set-asides for low-income and minority communities.

The sweeping bill also contains $25 billion in rental assistance, $15 billion for theaters and other live venues, $82 billion for local schools, colleges and universities, and $10 billion for child care.

The House easily passed a COVID-19 relief bill Monday as dusk fell over the Capitol in Washington. The Senate followed soon after

The governmentwide appropriations bill was likely to provide a last $1.4 billion installment for Trump's U.S.-Mexico border wall as a condition of winning his signature. The Pentagon would receive $696 billion.

Democrats and Senate Republicans prevailed in a bid to use bookkeeping maneuvers to squeeze $12.5 billion more for domestic programs into the legislation.

The bill was an engine to carry much of Capitol Hill's unfinished business, including an almost 400-page water resources bill that targets $10 billion for 46 Army Corps of Engineers flood control, environmental and coastal protection projects. Another addition would extend a batch of soon-to-expire tax breaks, such as one for craft brewers, wineries and distillers.

It also would carry numerous clean-energy provisions sought by Democrats with fossil fuel incentives favored by Republicans, $7 billion to increase access to broadband, $4 billion to help other nations vaccinate their people, $14 billion for cash-starved transit systems, $1 billion for Amtrak and $2 billion for airports and concessionaires. Food stamp benefits would temporarily be increased by 15%.

The Senate Historical Office said the previous record for the length of legislation was the 2,847-page tax reform bill of 1986 - about one-half the size of Monday's behemoth."	right

jzta4e	conservative	Trump Administration To Start Transition Process For Biden	"The Trump administration will begin the formal transition process for the incoming administration of Democrat Joe Biden, according to a letter from the administration.

The announcement from General Services Administration (GSA) Administrator Emily W. Murphy comes after House Democrats demanded earlier in the day to be briefed on why the process had not already started.

“I want to thank Emily Murphy at GSA for her steadfast dedication and loyalty to our Country,” President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter. “She has been harassed, threatened, and abused – and I do not want to see this happen to her, her family, or employees of GSA. Our case STRONGLY continues, we will keep up the good fight, and I believe we will prevail! Nevertheless, in the best interest of our Country, I am recommending that Emily and her team do what needs to be done with regard to initial protocols, and have told my team to do the same.”

…fight, and I believe we will prevail! Nevertheless, in the best interest of our Country, I am recommending that Emily and her team do what needs to be done with regard to initial protocols, and have told my team to do the same. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 23, 2020

In a letter addressed to Biden, Murphy wrote:

As the Administrator of the U.S. General Services Administration, I have the ability under the Presidential Transition Act of 1963, as amended, to make certain post-election resources and services available to assist in the event of a presidential transition. See 3 U.S.C. § 102 note (the “Act”). I take this role seriously and, because of recent developments involving legal challenges and certifications of election results, am transmitting this letter today to make those resources and services available to you. I have dedicated much of my adult life to public service, and I have always strived to do what is right. Please know that I came to my decision independently, based on the law and available facts. I was never directly or indirectly pressured by any Executive Branch official- including those who work at the White House or GSA- with regard to the substance or timing of my decision. To be clear, I did not receive any direction to delay my determination. I did, however, receive threats online, by phone, and by mail directed at my safety, my family, my staff, and even my pets in an effort to coerce me into making this determination prematurely. Even in the face of thousands of threats, I always remained committed to upholding the law. Contrary to media reports and insinuations, my decision was not made out of fear or favoritism. Instead, I strongly believe that the statute requires that the GSA Administrator ascertain, not impose, the apparent president-elect. Unfortunately, the statute provides no procedures or standards for this process, so I looked to precedent from prior elections involving legal challenges and incomplete counts. GSA does not dictate the outcome of legal disputes and recounts, nor does it determine whether such proceedings are reasonable or justified. These are issues that the Constitution, federal laws, and state laws leave to the election certification process and decisions by courts of competent jurisdiction. I do not think that an agency charged with improving federal procurement and property management should place itself above the constitutionally-based election process. I strongly urge Congress to consider amendments to the Act. As you know, the GSA Administrator does not pick or certify the winner of a presidential election. Instead, the GSA Administrator’s role under the Act is extremely narrow: to make resources and services available in connection with a presidential transition. As stated, because of recent developments involving legal challenges and certifications of election results, I have determined that you may access the post-election resources and services described in Section 3 of the Act upon request. The actual winner of the presidential election will be determined by the electoral process detailed in the Constitution. Section 7 of the Act and Public Law 116-159, dated October 1, 2020, which provides continuing appropriations until December 11 , 2020, makes $6,300,000 available to you to carry out the provisions of Section 3 of the Act. In addition, $1,000,000 is authorized, pursuant to Public Law 116-159, to provide appointee orientation sessions and a transition directory. I remind you that Section 6 of the Act imposes reporting requirements on you as a condition for receiving services and funds from GSA. If there is anything we can do to assist you, please contact Ms. Mary D. Gibert, the Federal Transition Coordinator.

loxp1x	conservative	Poll: Nearly Two-Thirds of Americans Want a Third Party to Represent Their Interests	"According to a Gallup poll published this week, nearly two-thirds of American adults believe that the Democratic and Republican parties “do such a poor job representing the American people that a third party is needed.”

Gallup reported that this is the highest percentage of U.S. adults desiring a third party since it started polling on this issue in 2003.

The poll revealed that half of all U.S. adults have rejected party affiliation and identify as politically independent — the highest percentage ever measured in a Gallup poll. Of independents, 70 percent favor the idea of a third party.

Those who identify as Republicans follow closely behind, at 63 percent. This is a marked increase since September when just 40 percent of Republicans favored the formation of a third party.

The uptick is likely fueled by Trump loyalists’ view that the antipathy that GOP establishment types — such as Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell — expressed toward former President Donald Trump in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 incursion into the Capitol was a party betrayal.

Trump has publicly flirted with the idea of creating a third party, according to the Wall Street Journal, and Reuters reported that Never-Trump Republicans have entertained the notion, too. The surge in interest among Republicans for a third party is no doubt attributable to these public discussions.

In contrast to Republicans, Democrats’ support for a third party has waned over the last few months. Although 52 percent of Democrats wanted a third party in September, only 46 percent favor the idea now.

While this downward slide owes in part to Democrats having won the presidency and majorities in both branches of Congress, it also likely results from Biden’s pledge to incorporate the radical leftists’ agenda into his own platform.

Nevertheless, despite muted enthusiasm among Democrats for a third party, the stage is set for an intra-party rift that could quickly crescendo. Recall that just one year ago, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York declared that “in any other country, Joe Biden and I would not be in the same party.”

Democrats found common ground in their shared contempt for Trump, but that glue will likely chip now that Trump is out of office and his second impeachment is behind us.

It is only a matter of time before the tensions between the Democratic Party’s progressive wing and its more moderate members boil over. Just one month into Biden’s term, the fault lines are already starting to widen.

This week, Biden angered the AOC-Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont element by publicly refusing to unilaterally cancel $50,000 of student loan debt per borrower. This type of infighting will undoubtedly increase in frequency and intensity each time Biden rejects a radical agenda item from his party’s left flank, and the calls for a third party will become louder.

Third parties are nothing new — they have been a regular, and important, feature of the political landscape throughout American history, often serving to highlight divisive issues that the major parties prefer to ignore. And they have played a role in bringing about important social change, such as the abolition of slavery and the establishment of women’s suffrage.

Independent political groups such as the Free Soil Party, the Nullifier Party, the Anti-Masonic Party, the Greenback Party, the Prohibition Party and the Green Party were all created to advocate for or oppose one or more prominent issues of the day.

Others, like the Liberal Republican Party, were created to support or oppose particular political candidates.

And, of course, third parties have been born out of political ideology. The People’s Party, the Socialist Party and the Libertarian Party are examples of these.

There has been no shortage of third parties in our nation’s history. Indeed, there are over 26 active ones in the United States today.

Yet, due to the Republican and Democratic parties’ shared concern that third-party candidates would siphon votes away from their own candidates (think Ross Perot in 1992 or Ralph Nader in 2000), entrenched political interests pushed for state laws to discourage new third parties from forming.

These included “sore-loser laws,” which prevent candidates who lose in primaries from running as third-party candidates in both presidential and congressional contests, and “anti-fusion laws” that prohibit candidates from being nominated by more than one party.

Also, many states’ ballot access laws require that a substantial percentage of registered voters sign petitions in order for a party to appear on the ballot. This presents a substantial barrier for many third parties, which do not have the organizational support that major parties enjoy, and whose candidates usually lack name recognition.

Similarly, federal campaign finance laws require that minor parties obtain at least 5 percent of the popular vote in the previous election in order to qualify for matching funds. This puts third-party candidates at a marked disadvantage compared to major party candidates.

Given these obstacles, it’s no wonder that it has been over 50 years since a third party won even a single elector in a presidential election.

Still, we should not forget that former President Abraham Lincoln was elected president as a third-party candidate in 1860, when the upstart Republican Party beat the Whigs and the Democrats on an anti-slavery platform.

While the present level of support for a third party may not be quite enough to upset the current duopoly, a viable third party is closer to reality than it has been in a long while.

The Jan. 21-Feb. 2 Gallup poll surveyed 906 adults over the age of 18 in the U.S. and reported a margin of error rate of +/- 6 percentage points.

m5j4r8	conservative	It’s Time For Americans To Refuse To Trade With Slaveholders -- Now that we know, beyond a doubt, of China's abhorrent treatment of the Uighurs we must reconsider our relations with the Slave Power rising in the East.	"Now that we know, beyond a doubt, of China's abhorrent treatment of the Uighurs we must reconsider our relations with the Slave Power rising in the East.

The nation billing itself as a “worker’s paradise” has become the largest driver of slaves in the world. When we speak of slavery in Communist China, we do not mean it as a metaphor. Red China is practicing real, modern-day slavery — holding people in bondage and forcing them to labor for someone else’s benefit.

Western society has largely ignored the problem for the same reason we turn a blind eye to all sorts of atrocities out of Red China: we like to buy the cheap stuff they make. Strikingly, despite our national obsession with the historical slavery that occurred in America’s past, we hesitate to mention the offense happening in China right now for all the world to see.

Everything we import from Communist China reinforces their inhumane system. This was true before their widespread use of Uighur slaves was made known (communist countries are all unfree in some ways).

Now that we know beyond a doubt, however, that thousands and thousands of Uighurs are imprisoned for racial and religious reasons and compelled to labor, we must reconsider our relations with the new Slave Power rising in the East. Our trade with China is, to paraphrase William Lloyd Garrison, a covenant with death and an agreement with Hell.

Rise of a New Slave Power

The Chinese state has persecuted the Uighur people in their western region for decades, but only recently has this war on China’s own people reached proportions that could reasonably be called genocidal. The Uighurs’ adherence to Islam and non-Chinese ways of life stand in the way of the atheist state’s steamroller effort to impose uniformity. Indeed, since Xi Jinping’s rise to power in China, the nation has adopted more forceful measures against dissidents, especially among the Uighurs.

Announced in 2014, Xi’s “people’s war on terror” led to more than 1 million Uighurs being held in concentration camps by 2018, along with Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and various other Muslims, Christians, and political dissenters. By 2020, reports emerged that China was not merely imprisoning and “re-educating” these people (although that would have been bad enough). Sadly, we now know the communist state is leasing out its bondsmen to toil against their will in factories and on farms.

According to a 2020 report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, in “conditions that strongly suggest forced labour, Uyghurs are working in factories that are in the supply chains of at least 82 well-known global brands in the technology, clothing and automotive sectors, including Apple, BMW, Gap, Huawei, Nike, Samsung, Sony and Volkswagen.” The report continues:

The estimated figure is conservative and the actual figure is likely to be far higher. In factories far away from home, they typically live in segregated dormitories, undergo organised Mandarin and ideological training outside working hours, are subject to constant surveillance, and are forbidden from participating in religious observances.

That does not even get into the forced abortions and sterilizations that Communist China has always imposed on these and other citizens of their country.

The Willful Blindness of Corporations

Western corporations implicated in the report profess shock and ignorance at what has transpired there. Nike says it’s “concerned about reports of forced labor,” maintaining the company has “strengthened” its “audit protocols” to identify “emerging risks related to potential labor transfer programs” — a perfect concatenation of corporate buzzwords that means a promise they are really looking into it this time.

Other industry responses are similar. In a statement to the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre, Abercrombie & Fitch maintains, “Our sourcing and sustainability teams closely monitor our network of suppliers to ensure we only work with organizations aligned with our principles and values.”

The Gap says it’s “taking steps to better understand how our global supply chain may be indirectly impacted, including working with our suppliers and actively engaging with industry trade groups, expert stakeholders, and other partners to learn more and advance our shared commitment to respecting human rights.”

Apple proclaims it’s “dedicated to ensuring that everyone in our supply chain is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.”

Fine words. But what do they mean? Are any of these companies moving production out of China and into a non-slaveholding country? No. Of course not.

Guilt Pervades the System

We’ve heard this all before from companies that do business in China because they issued the same phony responses to reports that factories there used illegal child labor. They start with denial, promise to investigate, and then maybe, years later, cut ties with a supplier whose use of children in its factories is too obvious to be ignored. Apple took three years to end its relationship with a child labor factory when the crime was discovered in 2013.

Why didn’t they know about the infraction in the first place? Because they did not want to know. It was not in their interest to know. Everyone was making money, and if some unscrupulous industrialist in a city their customers have never heard of is breaking the law, well, as long as Apple’s hands weren’t dirtied directly, no one would kick up much of a fuss. But their hands were dirty then and they are dirtier now. So are all of ours when we buy their products.

Last term, Congress tried to do something about it. The Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act sponsored by Sen. Marco Rubio became law with President Trump’s signature in 2020. Apple and others, however, lobbied hard against the bill, although it imposes sanctions on the people and entities responsible for human rights abuses in China and requires investigation into the subject. That is a good start, but it does not go far enough.

‘Different Norms’

Slavery will continue in China as long as it is profitable for slavedrivers. It took a Civil War to end slavery in this country and considerable efforts for the other world powers to abandon the practice. Sanctions send a good message but cannot do any good when the governments of free nations are unable to monitor what goes on behind the new iron curtain. China will say these accusations are untrue, the corporations will say that they see no evil, and nothing will change.

Pressed on these issues last month, President Joe Biden responded with moral relativism, giving lip service to human rights while chalking up the way China treats its people to “different norms . ” Too many in his administration and in both major parties are deeply invested in trade with China. Government, like big business, will say soothing things and promise investigations. But nothing will fundamentally change at that level.

Change will not come from those with a vested interest in the status quo. In the late 1700s, abolitionists in Britain boycotted sugar, one of the biggest products of African slavery in the Americas. Led by William Wilberforce — an evangelical Christian and member of Parliament — they called for Britons to give up one of the most prominent fruits of the slave system.

Sugar (and rum, its by-product) were popular goods, then as now. Having failed to convince Parliament to change the law, these abolitionists sought to make slavery less profitable while removing themselves from the chain of coercive commerce.

They were not successful overnight, but Britain eventually banned the slave trade in 1807 and abolished slavery in its colonies in 1833. The boycott alone did not do all of this, but making an issue of something most Englishmen were content to ignore helped. “It is now brought so directly before our eyes that his House must decide,” Wilberforce said in a 1791 speech to Parliament, “and must justify to all the world, and to their own consciences, the rectitude of the grounds and the principles of their decision.”

Believe in Something

Being against slavery in 2021 hardly feels revolutionary, but it is not a universally held position in corporate boardrooms and government offices. Nike likes to tell us that we should “believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.” They will not sacrifice a penny of their profits to make their products in a free labor country, but we do not have to be a part of that calculus. There are other sneakers. There are other clothes and other cell phones, too. We do not have to make a “covenant with death.”

Students of history often wonder how ordinary people could consume the products of slavery without giving a second thought to the unfree men and women forced to produce them.

But it is easy to ignore far-off hardships, and that is just what we’re all doing right now. When we buy clothes made in China, where enslaved Uighurs are picking cotton, we are no different than those nineteenth-century people who ignored the sources of cotton in the American South or sugar in the West Indies.

It is hard to take action as an individual and easy to feel helpless. If I refuse to buy an iPhone, will it make any difference in a world where Apple sells millions of them? But acting together can raise an issue high enough that even the most elevated ranks of society are forced to look at it. If activists on the left can call for boycotts over every infraction of woke dogma, why should regular people not do the same over a practice as horrible as slavery?

We cannot force Apple or Nike to run ethical supply chains. But we can — and should — make the issue so prominent in people’s minds that they can’t look at an iPad or a pair of Jordans without thinking of concentration camps, genocide, and slavery."	right

U.S.—After being permanently banned from social media, President Trump has been forced to knock on doors across the country, one door at a time. If anyone opens the door, he will shout one of his classic lines such as ""RIGGED ELECTION!"" or ""Hillary is a loser! SAD!"" at them before moving on to the next house.

""Nothing-- and I mean nothing, will stop me from getting my important message out to the American people,"" said Trump. ""I knock on every door and tell people face to face. Low-energy people could never do something like that but luckily your favorite president is HIGH ENERGY!""

He then moved to the next house in the neighborhood and pounded on the door. An elderly woman answered. Trump took a deep breath and shouted ""UNFAIR! NOT GOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY!"" Instantly, the woman's eyes were opened when she received the important message. A MAGA hat miraculously appeared on her head and she became a true patriot.

Experts claim it will take approximately 1311 years for Trump to complete this task if he visits each door. ""Plenty of time! MAGA!"" yelled Trump, running off into the sunset."	right

“Every year, Congress spends billions of dollars on giveaways for the well-connected: Washington insiders get taxpayer money and members of Congress get re-elected, all while the system fails the American people. It’s no wonder that the vast majority of Americans from every political stripe – Republicans, Democrats, and Independents – overwhelmingly support congressional term limits,” said Sen. Cruz.

The amendment would limit U.S. Senators to two six-year terms, and members of the House of Representatives to three two-year terms.

“The rise of political careerism in today’s Congress is a sharp departure from what the Founders intended for our federal governing bodies. I have long called for this solution for the brokenness of Washington, D.C., and I will continue fighting to hold career politicians accountable. As I have done in the past, I urge my colleagues to submit this constitutional amendment to the states for speedy ratification,” Sen. Cruz said.

Sen. Cruz was joined by Sen. Mike Braum (R-Ind.), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) in reintroducing the amendment.

j106fp	conservative	NY Times: Trump paid $750 in US income taxes in 2016, 2017	"President Donald Trump paid just $750 in federal income taxes the year he ran for president and in his first year in the White House, according to a report Sunday in The New York Times.

Trump, who has fiercely guarded his tax filings and is the only president in modern times not to make them public, paid no federal income taxes in 10 of the past 15 years.

The details of the tax filings complicate Trump’s description of himself as a shrewd and patriotic businessman, revealing instead a series of financial losses and income from abroad that could come into conflict with his responsibilities as president. The president’s financial disclosures indicated he earned at least $434.9 million in 2018, but the tax filings reported a $47.4 million loss.

The tax filings also illustrate how a reputed billionaire could pay little to nothing in taxes, while someone in the middle class could pay substantially more than him. Roughly half of Americans pay no income taxes, primarily because of how low their incomes are. But IRS figures indicate that the average tax filer paid roughly $12,200 in 2017, about 16 times more than what the president paid.

The disclosure, which the Times said comes from tax return data it obtained extending over two decades, comes at a pivotal moment ahead of the first presidential debate Tuesday and weeks before a divisive election against Democrat Joe Biden.

Speaking at a news conference Sunday at the White House, Trump dismissed the report as “fake news” and maintained he has paid taxes, though he gave no specifics. He also vowed that information about his taxes “will all be revealed,” but he offered no timeline for the disclosure and made similar promises during the 2016 campaign on which he never followed through.

In fact, the president has fielded court challenges against those seeking access to his returns, including the U.S. House, which is suing to get Trump’s tax returns as part of congressional oversight.

During his first two years as president, Trump received $73 million from foreign operations, which in addition to his golf properties in Scotland and Ireland included $3 million from the Philippines, $2.3 million from India and $1 million from Turkey, among other nations. The president in 2017 paid $145,400 in taxes in India and $156,824 in the Philippines, compared to just $750 in U.S. income taxes. The Times said the tax records did not reveal any unreported connections to Russia.

Trump found multiple ways to reduce his tax bills. He has taken tax deductions on personal expenses such as housing, aircraft and $70,000 to style his hair while he filmed “The Apprentice.” Losses in the property businesses solely owned and managed by Trump appear to have offset income from his stake in “The Apprentice” and other entities with multiple owners.

During the first two years of his presidency, Trump relied on business tax credits to reduce his tax obligations. The Times said $9.7 million worth of business investment credits that were submitted after Trump requested an extension to file his taxes allowed him to offset his obligations and pay just $750 each in 2016 and 2017.

Income tax payments help finance the military and domestic programs.

Trump, starting in 2010, claimed and received an income tax refund that totaled $72.9 million, which the Times said was at the core of an ongoing audit by the IRS. The Times said a ruling against Trump could cost him $100 million or more.

The president could also face mounting financial pressure in the years ahead. The tax records show he’s carrying a total of $421 million in loans and debt that are primarily due within four years. Most of that debt comes from the Doral golf resort in Florida ($125 million) and Trump’s Washington hotel ($160 million), two properties that the Times said are struggling financially.

Full Coverage: Donald Trump

Richard Neal, D-Mass., the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee who has tried unsuccessfully to obtain Trump’s tax records, said the Times report makes it even more essential for his committee to get the documents.

“It appears that the President has gamed the tax code to his advantage and used legal fights to delay or avoid paying what he owes,” Neal wrote in a statement. “Now, Donald Trump is the boss of the agency he considers an adversary. It is essential that the IRS’s presidential audit program remain free of interference.”

A lawyer for the Trump Organization, Alan Garten, and a spokesperson for the Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press on the report.

Garten told the Times that “most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate.”

He said in a statement to the news organization that the president “has paid tens of millions of dollars in personal taxes to the federal government, including paying millions in personal taxes since announcing his candidacy in 2015.”

The New York Times said it declined to provide Garten with the tax filings in order to protect its sources, but it said its sources had legal access to the records.

During his first general election debate against Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016, Clinton said that perhaps Trump wasn’t releasing his tax returns because he had paid nothing in federal taxes.

Google removed at least 100,000 negative reviews of the stock trading app Robinhood from the Google Play app store after angry users sent a flood of critical reviews that caused the app’s rating to plummet on Thursday. The app’s rating went from roughly four stars out of five on Wednesday to just one star on Thursday. Robinhood users were understandably upset after the company halted purchases of GameStop’s stock and other stocks promoted by Reddit’s WallStreetBets community.

A Google spokesperson confirmed the tech giant has deleted the reviews and defended the move overnight, telling Gizmodo over email that it has rules against “coordinated or inorganic reviews.” Gizmodo asked how negative reviews could be deemed “inorganic” when people seem reasonably upset about Robinhood’s actions in recent days. Google stopped responding to Gizmodo’s emails after that inquiry.

Robinhood’s rating on the Google Play app store has rebounded to over four stars since Google deleted the negative reviews. The app also has a 4.7 rating on Apple’s app store, though it’s not clear what kind of moderation Apple has done of its reviews for Robinhood this week.

There are still questions about what actually led Robinhood to halt purchases of stocks picked by Reddit’s WallStreetBets on Thursday—stocks that include not just GameStop but Nokia, Blackberry, and AMC Theaters, among others. An early theory was that hedge funds which had shorted the stocks had leaned on Robinhood to halt trading, but an alternate theory emerged that Robinhood simply didn’t have the cash flow to continue processing so many stock purchases.

The latter theory seems to have been bolstered by a new report early Friday from the New York Times claiming Robinhood has raised roughly $1 billion from existing investors like Sequoia Capital and Ribbit Capital. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev denied the company was having liquidity problems on CNBC yesterday, but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t anticipating liquidity problems in the very near future.

Robinhood users angry with the company’s decision to halt purchases of GameStop filed a class action lawsuit on Thursday, a move that would seem to give credence to the idea that a negative app rating on Google Play isn’t necessarily “inorganic.”

It’s been a turbulent week on the stock market, as activist retail investors on Reddit have shown the entire system to be a scam in favor of the wealthy. But no one knows where that will leave U.S. financial markets in the coming days and weeks.

Most Americans know in their heart of hearts that the game is rigged. But this week’s actions by activist investors on Reddit have really made the rules plain for the entire world to see. The wealthy will not tolerate average people making money while they suffer.

The question is how far hedge fund managers and other wealthy people are willing to take this to defend their class interests. If history is any guide, the answer is “pretty damn far.”"	right

kq7ocp	conservative	Biden's inaugural parade is canceled and replaced with a virtual version to avoid drawing large crowds amid the pandemic	"President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration parade has been cancelled in favor of a virtual version designed to limit crowds during the coronavirus era.

Organizers announced the changes on Sunday, saying that a 'virtual parade across America' will be held instead of the traditional procession on Inauguration Day, January 20.

Following the swearing-in ceremony on the west front of the US Capitol, Biden and his wife, first lady Jill Biden, will join Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and her husband in participating in a socially distanced Pass in Review on the Capitol's opposite front side. Those are military traditions where Biden will review the readiness of military troops.

Biden will also receive a traditional presidential escort with representatives from every branch of the military from 15th Street in Washington to the White House.

That, the Presidential Inaugural Committee says, will be socially distanced too, while 'providing the American people and world with historic images of the President-elect proceeding to the White House without attracting large crowds'.

Accordingly, organizers also said they will hold a virtual parade nationwide to 'celebrate America's heroes, highlight Americans from all walks of life in different states and regions, and reflect on the diversity, heritage, and resilience of the country as we begin a new American era'.

The parade event will be televised and feature 'diverse, dynamic' performances in communities across the country, the inaugural committee promised.

Participants will be announced in coming weeks.

'We are excited about the possibilities and opportunities this moment presents to allow all Americans to participate in our country's sacred inaugural traditions,' said Presidential Inaugural Committee Executive Director Maju Varghese said in a statement.

Minnesota Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar says Congress should send President Donald Trump what he wants: a COVID-19 stimulus bill that contains nothing but direct $2,000 payments to the American people.

Additional COVID-19 relief measures and omnibus spending allocations should be detached from the “survival checks” and handled in a separate bill, Omar tweeted late Tuesday night, noting that Trump has already promised to immediately sign a “clean” direct payment bill:

“We need to send a clean bill with just $2,000 survival checks and a separate spending/covid relief bill. “Negotiating everything into one bill is how we got here, since Trump wants to sign a bill with survival checks, let’s send one to his desk right away.”

On Tuesday, Pres. Trump said he would veto the most recent bill passed by Congress, which attaches the pork-filled omnibus spending bill to provisions for $600 COVID-19 stimulus checks. Trump has said he wants Americans to receive $2,000 checks:

“It’s called the ‘COVID-Relief Bill,’ but it has almost nothing to COVID” … ""I am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 (direct payment) to $2,000 or $4,000 for a couple.

kseejt	conservative	It's Time For Mitch McConnell To Go	"Senator Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who currently holds what I suppose we now call the Office of the Outgoing Senate Majority Leader, has to go. He’s a man unsuited for the times. The results prove it.

It is McConnell who has been the architect of Republican defeat in the Senate. Heading into the 2016 election, there were 54 Republican senators. After the election there were 52. Then, in 2018, McConnell backed the disastrous candidacy of Martha McSally for an open seat in Arizona. It was McConnell who picked her and crowded out other viable candidates. That year McSally lost by 2.4 percentage points to Kyrsten Sinema while, at the same time, Republican Doug Ducey cruised to a nearly 15-point win as Arizona’s governor.

Voters didn’t reject Republicans as such; they rejected McSally. McConnell then lobbied for McSally to be appointed to the seat vacated by John McCain, setting up another McSally defeat at the hands of Mark Kelly in November. Again, she trailed the Republican at the top of ticket, underperforming Donald Trump. And once again, it was McConnell’s doing. In Arizona he helped engineer the loss of two Republican senate seats in two years by handpicking a candidate Arizonans didn’t want.

He finished the job in 2020 with a loss in Colorado, an admittedly tough race on unfavorable terrain. But it was the run-off elections in Georgia that sealed the deal. There, McConnell selected Kelly Loeffler over elected Republicans like U.S. Representative Doug Collins for appointment to the seat held by Johnny Isakson, who resigned for health reasons. Why? McConnell never explained his rationale publicly but it wouldn’t be a stretch to think that he thought he was being clever and wagered that female candidates would get female votes that a male candidate wouldn’t get. Plus, Loeffler is very wealthy and pledged to put at least $20 million of her own money into the campaign.

How did McConnell’s 2D chess work out? Loeffler came in second in the three-way November race and came in second again in the run-off. Meaning she lost. And it looks like incumbent David Perdue will also lose and Democrats will have control of the Senate.

Don’t reward failure. Any political party that is serious about winning holds leadership accountable for losses. Trump critics have been quick to say that he owns the Georgia losses. I think that’s wrong, but he’s already been held accountable to voters. Senate Republicans need to hold McConnell accountable and find new leadership. He is simply the wrong man at the wrong time. At 78 years old, his policy priorities and his political instincts belong to another time. Republicans have a lot of work to do if they want to earn back the right to govern and if given that opportunity to use the power they are given to make life better for Americans.

When it suited him, McConnell was able to summon plenty of time and energy to pass tax cuts and bailouts for big corporations—which, incidentally, overwhelmingly support Democrats and their woke-agenda—but he could never seem to get around to passing legislation that would benefit the middle class. He was good at getting Trump’s judicial nominees confirmed, though with court-packing on Biden’s agenda it’s not clear how much that will matter. But doing that didn’t win any elections.

As Gray Connolly noted in a smart Twitter thread:

As a general rule, any conservative politics that does not propose and enact policies to conserve its working & middle classes—especially in a time of crisis or pandemic—deserves that no effort be made for its own conservation by the electors. There is significant demographic 40s & younger that has never known a sustained good economic period—prime earning years wiped out by the (great financial crisis), QE & now the Pandemic. People who are in debt & whose work is insecure & wages stagnant do not care about your kraken idiocy etc.

McConnell—and for that matter most Republican senators—either don’t know this or don’t care. The Senate was designed to be the legislative body most insulated from the excitability of electoral politics. The six-year term is supposed to allow senators to take a longer view. But the issues of concern to voters now are not temporary flights of passion and they’re not going away. In fact, the urgency is only rising and Republicans need leadership who knows it.

Mitch McConnell can’t lead Republicans out of the wilderness. His time has passed. He’ll be 84 at the end of his current term. He shouldn’t even put his name forward for a leadership position. But he will. If Republicans know what the country needs and if they want to win again, they’ll reject McConnell and find younger leadership that is ready to build a new party to serve the middle class, not the ruling class."	right
knuhag	conservative	McConnell again blocks quick vote on $2,000 stimulus checks, slams 'socialism for rich people'	"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell again blocked quick action on $2,000 coronavirus stimulus checks on the Senate floor Thursday as he traded harsh words with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

McConnell, R-Ky., in floor remarks lambasted the House-passed bill for $2,000 stimulus checks as ""socialism for rich people."" The comments were his most direct to date on his opposition to President Trump's request that stimulus checks be boosted from $600 in the recently passed stimulus.

""The data show that many upper-middle class Americans have kept their jobs, work remotely and remain totally financially comfortable,"" McConnell said. ""On the other hand, some of our fellow citizens have had their entire existences is turned upside down and continue to suffer terribly. We do not need to let the speaker of the House do socialism for rich people in order to help those who need help.""

The majority leader earlier this week introduced his own bill for $2,000 stimulus checks, tying them to other Trump priorities: repealing controversial Section 230 liability protections for online platforms and investigating election security. He made no promises that the bill would be considered, only vague comments that the Senate would ""begin a process to bring these three priorities into focus.""

HERE'S WHEN YOUR SECOND STIMULUS CHECK WILL ARRIVE

McConnell also Wednesday emphasized that just this week the president signed a $900 billion stimulus package that included ""targeted"" stimulus efforts.

""The liberal New York Times reported this morning that a majority of the households that get non-targeted checks do not end up spending them on urgent needs,"" McConnell said, before detailing the provisions in the recent stimulus bill. ""There are billions for targeted food assistance, billions for targeted rental assistance, and many billions of dollars for vaccine distribution so we can finally beat this virus and re-open the economy in full. These are the kinds of targeted emergency programs that directly help the most vulnerable. And we just poured almost another trillion dollars into them less than five days ago.""

Schumer, D-N.Y., replied that McConnell is just trying to stall to prevent the checks from being passed. He said the majority leader's insistence that the Senate only consider checks along with Section 230 and election security would make it impossible for anything to become law.

BERNIE SANDERS AGREES WITH TRUMP'S PUSH FOR MORE CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS

""Let me make this offer to the Republican majority. We're willing to vote on the other issues that President Trump mentioned. All the issues the Republican leader says must be addressed, so long as we vote on them separately,"" Schumer said. ""If Leader McConnell wants a vote on these issues, we're here for it. Just give us a vote on the House-passed bill and we can vote on whatever right-wing conspiracy theory you'd like.""

Schumer then requested that the Senate quickly vote on the House bill on $2,000 stimulus checks. McConnell objected.

Soon after Schumer spoke, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also moved to quickly vote on the House bill for stimulus checks. McConnell objected to that, too.

Sanders said McConnell's move to tie $2,000 checks to Section 230 repeal and a voter fraud commission is a ""poison pill designed to kill that legislation.""

McConnell's resistance to $2,000 checks comes despite calls for the checks by Trump since shortly after Congress sent him the earlier stimulus bill with $600 checks. Trump has become increasingly frustrated with his fellow Republicans in recent weeks and directed a significant amount of that at top Senate Republicans.

""Unless Republicans have a death wish, and it is also the right thing to do, they must approve the $2000 payments ASAP. $600 IS NOT ENOUGH!"" Trump tweeted earlier this week. ""Also, get rid of Section 230 - Don’t let Big Tech steal our Country, and don’t let the Democrats steal the Presidential Election. Get tough!""

He added later: ""$2000ASAP!""

STIMULUS CHECKS ROUND 1 WENT TO DEAD PEOPLE: IS IRS BETTER PREPARED NOW?

The uproar over the stimulus checks came on what was scheduled to be a relatively tame Thursday in the upper chamber, as it's prioritized overriding President Trump's veto of the National Defense Authorization Act.

The Senate had no scheduled votes for Thursday. McConnell filed a ""cloture petition"" on the NDAA veto override Wednesday, which cannot be voted on until two days after it is filed. The Senate is currently scheduled to take its cloture vote -- meaning a procedural vote to end debate -- on the NDAA Friday, which would set up a final vote Saturday.

Between the Senate needing to pass the NDAA before the current Congress ends at noon on Sunday and McConnell's stalling tactics, it is now highly unlikely that the Senate will even make it to a vote on $2,000 stimulus checks, let alone pass them.

Josh Hawley is introducing a bill that would punish American companies for using slave labor to create their products, as multiple American businesses such as Nike and Apple have come under fire for their ties to Chinese labor camps that incarcerate Uighur Muslims.

The Slave-Free Business Certification Act would require every American business that takes in over $500 million worldwide to conduct audits and have CEOs certify to the U.S. Department of Labor that their companies are not using slave labor in their supply chains, in addition to publishing a report of the company’s efforts to ensure their supply chains are free of forced labor. The bill would also allow the Labor Secretary to fine companies up to $500 million for failing to comply.

“Corporate America and the celebrities that hawk their products talk up corporate social responsibility and social justice at home while making millions of dollars off the slave labor that assembles their products,” Hawley said. “Executives build woke, progressive brands for American consumers, but happily outsource labor to Chinese concentration camps.”

In March, a study published by Forbes revealed that 83 companies worldwide, including American businesses such as Nike, Gap, Tommy Hilfiger, General Motors, Apple, Google, and Microsoft, had “directly or indirectly” profited from Chinese treatment of Uighur Muslims. Hawley has also slammed the NBA for its ties with China, after fans were prohibited from customizing their basketball jerseys with the slogan “FreeHongKong.”

Rather than let fans order #FreeHongKong jerseys @nba kills custom gear altogether. Now about the slave labor that helps make all those @nba @nike product lines … https://t.co/BK5dnWbE9i — Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) July 16, 2020

Hawley’s bill comes a week after U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr lambasted corporate America and Hollywood for “kowtowing” to the Chinese Communist Party. Barr specifically called out companies like Google, Microsoft, and Apple for being “all too willing to collaborate with the CCP.”

In addition to companies that benefit from Chinese labor camps, Hawley criticized businesses like Starbucks and Nespresso for their use of Brazilian workers that Hawley alleged are “denied basic necessities like food and water.”"	right
mv0izm	conservative	BREAKING: Derek Chauvin Guilty On All 3 Counts In George Floyd's Death	"MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) — Following nearly a year of protest, introspection and raw emotion, former Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin, who last May held a knee down on George Floyd’s neck for more than 9 minutes, has been found guilty of second-degree murder and two other charges in Floyd’s death.

Chauvin has been remanded to the custody of Hennepin County. He was led out of the courtroom in handcuffs.

The Minnesota Department of Corrections says Chauvin was booked into Minnesota Correctional Facility-Oak Park Heights just before 5 p.m., as part of an agreement with the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office.

According to a pool report, George Floyd’sbrother, Philonise Floyd, was praying in the courtroom before the verdict was read.

“I was just praying they would find him guilty,” he said after the conviction. “As an African American, we usually never get justice.”

Family members of George Floyd, along with attorney Ben Crump and Rev. Al Sharpton, held a press conference about an hour after the verdict was read. Sharpton first led a prayer with the family.

“Let’s lean into this moment and let’s make sure that this moment will be documented for our children as they continue on the journey to justice knowing that the blood of George Floyd will give them a trail to find a way to a better America,” Crump said.

The verdict was read in Hennepin County court just after 4 p.m. Tuesday. In addition to the second-degree murder conviction, the jury found Chauvin guilty of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.

“George Floyd mattered. He was loved by his family and his friends,” Attorney General Keith Ellison said at a press conference Tuesday afternoon. “But that isn’t why he mattered. He mattered because he was a human being. And there is no way that we can turn away from that reality.”

President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris spoke Tuesday evening on Chauvin’s conviction.

In a statement released Tuesday evening, Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo — who fired Chauvin one day after Floyd’s death, and testified against him in his trial — thanked the jurors for “their immense responsibility and honorable civic duty.” He also called for peace and calm.

“Now is the time to use our humanity to lift each other up and not tear our City down,” Arradondo said.

It took the jury roughly 10 hours of deliberation to reach their verdict — about four hours Monday afternoon and evening, and another six hours Tuesday starting at 8 a.m.

Chauvin was convicted on the following charges:

Second-degree unintentional murder means causing death without intent by committing a felony.

Second-degree manslaughter is causing death by unreasonable risk.

Third-degree murder means causing death by an “eminently dangerous” act, showing a “depraved mind.”

Earlier Tuesday, WCCO’s Esme Murphy reported that Hennepin County court employees were notified to stop working at all downtown courthouse locations and to “exit downtown immediately.”

Public safety officials said there would be no statewide curfew Tuesday night. Following Chauvin’s conviction, crowds gathered at the Hennepin County Government Center, George Floyd Square at 38th and Chicago and in Brooklyn Center, where 20-year-old Daunte Wright was shot and killed by police in the middle of Chauvin’s trial.

No *statewide curfew* in Minnesota following verdict. ""We don't believe that makes any sense,"" says Dept. of Public Safety head John Harrington. Does this verdict change anything re: security? ""We do have a plan to continue our operation for this evening,"" he said. @wcco — Caroline Cummings (@CaroRCummings) April 20, 2021

The maximum penalty on second-degree murder charges is up to 40 years in prison, and the third-degree murder charges carries a sentence of up to 25 years in prison. The maximum penalty on second-degree manslaughter is up to 10 years in prison.

Judge Peter Cahill said sentencing will take place in about eight weeks.

The jurors heard closing arguments in the trial of Derek Chauvin Monday. The two sides split most significantly on the cause of death. The prosecution argued that all the law requires is that the prosecution prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that Chauvin’s knee restraint was a “substantial cause” of Floyd’s death.

The defense stressed that Chauvin did what any reasonable officer would have done and said it was wrong to look only at nine minutes and 29 seconds when Floyd was on the ground.

In a departure from how he has looked throughout the trial, Chauvin was maskless and looked directly at his attorney throughout the three-hour defense closing statement. For the rest of the testimony and the prosecution closing he was head down, masked and taking extensive notes.

While Nelson’s summation was lengthy, it was also complex. And that may be why Blackwell came back with this statement in his rebuttal argument. He said this case is not that complicated and that, in the state’s view, Chauvin caused Floyd’s death.

The line he left the jury with was this: “You were told, for example, that Mr. Floyd died because his heart was too big. You heard that testimony. And now having seen all the evidence, having heard all the evidence, you know the truth. And the truth of the matter is that the reason George Floyd is dead is because Mr. Chauvin’s heart was too small.”

Since the trial began last month, the prosecution called 38 people. The defense called seven people to testify in court. Chauvin was not one of them; he invoked his constitutional right not to testify. It was a decision that came without the jury present.

Now that Chauvin has been convicted, next comes the determination about whether any aggravating factors existed.

The first possible aggravating factor is whether the victim was “treated with particular cruelty.” The second is if a child was present. Witnesses at the scene and who testified included two teens who were 17 at the time, as well as a 9-year-old.

“If they find aggravating factors the judge could go all the way up to the statutory maximum, which for count one is up to 40 years, count two up to 25 years, and count three up to 10 years,” attorney Joe Tamburino told WCCO.

The other three officers involved are charged with aiding and abetting, and are expected to be tried jointly in August.

Earl Gray, the attorney representing ex-officer Thomas Lane, told WCCO he had no comment on Chauvin’s conviction."	right

kmjcy8	conservative	Mitch McConnell blocks unanimous vote on $2,000 COVID-19 stimulus checks	"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday blocked unanimous passage of the $2,000 COVID-19 stimulus checks requested by President Trump.

McConnell (R-Ky.) objected after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) asked for a unanimous vote on a five-page bill that passed the House on Monday with 44 Republican votes.

Trump requested the $2,000 checks last week, saying the $600 checks approved as part of a $2.3 trillion pandemic relief and government funding bill were too small.

McConnell blocked unanimous passage after scheduling a Wednesday vote to override Trump’s veto of a $740 billion defense bill.

It’s unclear if enough Senate Democrats will rally behind an attempted filibuster, or if the override vote will proceed without McConnell agreeing to a deal on $2,000 checks.

Trump tweeted after McConnell objected: “Unless Republicans have a death wish, and it is also the right thing to do, they must approve the $2000 payments ASAP. $600 IS NOT ENOUGH! Also, get rid of Section 230 – Don’t let Big Tech steal our Country, and don’t let the Democrats steal the Presidential Election. Get tough!”

McConnell did not explain his position on increasing check amounts, but before objecting, said the Senate would “begin a process” this week to bring that request and Trump’s push for repeal of Section 230 immunity for social media companies and election reforms “into focus.” He did not elaborate.

Schumer, citing a just-passed tax reform to benefit so-called “three martini lunches,” urged McConnell to allow “a simple up or down vote” on both the override and $2,000 checks before the legislative session ends Jan. 3.

Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who caucuses with the Democrats, threatened Monday to filibuster the unrelated override vote unless McConnell scheduled a vote on the $2,000 checks. But if 60 senators vote to end debate, the defense override vote can occur without concessions to Sanders.

Schumer said on the Senate floor that “$600 is not enough. Not enough for the mother in Nashville $4,000 behind on the rent whose water was shut off earlier this month, not for the medical receptionist in Macomb $2,100 behind on the rent, home electricity shut off in September on her son’s third day of virtual kindergarten.”

Sanders said “hunger in America is at the highest level it has been for decades, with moms and dads struggling to feed their kids and working families lining up mile after mile to get emergency food packages.”

He added: “We are even seeing an increase in grocery store shoplifting as desperate Americans try to keep their families from going hungry — all of it’s taking place in the wealthiest country in the history of the world.”

A growing number of Republican senators support the higher check amount, including Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue of Georgia, whose Jan. 5 runoff races against Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff will determine partisan control of the Senate next year.

Republican Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Josh Hawley of Missouri also back Trump’s call for $2,000 checks.

Supporters of the larger checks cite rising unemployment as a result of local government-ordered business closures due to the pandemic.

see also Trump calls for Congress to amend COVID relief bill President Trump on Tuesday night called for Congress to take...

Opponents of increasing the check amount say the boost would heap an estimated $463 billion onto the national debt and increase inflation.

Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said Monday it would be wise to pause and “assess the impact of vaccinations” that began this month.

Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, one of two Democratic “no” votes in the House, said “it is clearly a last-minute political maneuver by the president and extremists on both sides of the political spectrum who have been largely absent during months of very hard negotiations.”

The House-passed legislation would change the recently approved $600 amount to $2,000. The checks are means-tested — people who earn more than $95,000 and married couples making more than $190,000 get nothing under either the $600 or $2,000 proposals.

The $2.3 trillion bill that Trump signed Sunday creates a new $300 weekly supplement for unemployed people and adds $284 billion in Paycheck Protection Program forgivable small business loans. It also authorized $600 stimulus checks per dependent child."	right
k7uiz5	conservative	Trevor Noah Says Democrats Who Violated Their Own Coronavirus Rules Are ‘Even Worse Than The Anti-Maskers’	"In a scathing monologue on Thursday evening, comedian and The Daily Show host Trevor Noah slammed Democratic Party politicians who violated the restrictions they imposed amid the coronavirus pandemic, Mediaite reported.

Several prominent Democrats have been caught violating their own COVID-19 guidelines. Notably, last month, Austin Mayor Steve Adler released a video calling on his constituents to respect the rules and stay home. As it later turned out, he recorded the clip from from his timeshare in Mexico.

Noah played Adler's video, asking ""What is it with these Democrats?"" He then mimicked and mocked the mayor, ""All my boys in the pool know what I'm talking about! Say what's up, everybody.""

California Gov. Gavin Newsom and San Francisco Mayor London Breed have also been criticized for violating COVID-19 guidelines. Both were accused of hypocrisy after attending a private birthday party at an expensive restaurant while urging the American people to stay home, practice social distancing and wear protective face coverings.

""I'm sorry, man. Everyone has given up their lives and then you've got these politicians who are just hypocrites out here?"" Noah asked, proceeding to mock Newsom as ""Governor Hair Gel.""

""What, you guys think corona respects your office too much to come after you?"" Noah continued, saying that the Democrats he mentioned are worse than the people who refuse to wear masks that protect from COVID-19.

""In a way, these Democrats are even worse than the anti-maskers because of their hypocrisy. At least when those dudes break the rules they're open about it.""

Noah noted that he is aware of the fact that Republicans break the rules as well, holding mass gatherings and attending private parties, but said that the American public expects Democratic politicians to be better than that.

In his monologue, Noah echoed CNN anchor Brianna Keilar. Earlier this week, Keilar accused Newsom and other Democrats of hypocrisy, suggesting that the decisions they made prove they are unfit to lead the nation.

Keilar said that it's time for Democrats to ""look in the mirror"" instead of constantly criticizing their Republican colleagues for refusing to embrace masks and social distancing measures.

As Business Insider reported, 13 Democrats in total have been accused of violating coronavirus restrictions.

Along with the ones Noah mentioned, Los Angeles County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl, San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser have faced similar charges, according to the publication."	right
ipl3jd	conservative	Trump knew the coronavirus was 'deadly stuff' but chose to downplay it, according to recordings revealed in new Woodward book	"Trump knew the coronavirus was 'deadly stuff' but chose to downplay it, according to recordings revealed in new Woodward book

Show Caption Hide Caption President Trump asks reporter to take off face mask during question President Trump asked a Reuters journalist to remove his face mask while asking a question during a news conference at the White House. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump told journalist Bob Woodward that he knew the coronavirus was more deadly and contagious than the flu while he continued to downplay its dangers to the public, according to Woodward's new book ""Rage.""

""I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down, because I don’t want to create a panic,"" Trump told Woodward on March 19 in excerpts of audio interviews obtained by CNN.

In interviews with Woodward between December 2019 and July 2020, Trump discussed the threat of the coronavirus with a level of detail that he had not yet acknowledged to the public, noting Feb. 7 that it was ""deadly stuff,"" and ""more deadly than your – even your strenuous flus.""

While Trump discussed the threat of the virus to Woodward, he continued to assure the public that it was ""under control"" in the U.S. and would ""go away."" The pandemic has caused nearly 190,000 deaths in the U.S. with cases totaling over 6 million.

White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended the president on Wednesday after the publication of the interviews with Woodward, arguing that he was being a good leader by remaining calm.

""This president at a time when you're facing insurmountable challenges, it's important to express confidence, it's important to express calm,"" McEnany told reporters.

""The president has never lied to the American public on COVID,"" McEnany said. ""The president was expressing calm and his actions reflect that.""

Trump publicly compared the coronavirus to the flu, arguing that cases and deaths from the coronavirus were far less than the flu, but with the flu, ""Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on,"" as he tweeted March 9.

He also told Woodward he was aware the virus was transmitted through the air in February. Yet in April when the CDC began advising people to wear masks to stop the virus' spread, Trump continued to resist wearing a mask in public, and only solidly endorsed mask-wearing as ""patriotic"" in July.

""It goes through air, Bob,"" Trump told Woodward in February. ""That's always tougher than the touch. You don't have to touch things. Right? But the air, you just breathe the air and that's how it's passed.""

On March 19, the same day he told Woodward he was downplaying the virus to prevent panic and over a month after marveling at how easily the virus spread, Trump said during a White House briefing that the virus ""surprised the whole world.""

""And if people would have known about it, it could have stopped – been stopped in place. It could have been stopped right where it came from – China – if we would have known about it, if they would have known about it.""

""It's so easily transmissible, you wouldn't even believe it,"" he told Woodward on April 13, CNN reported. Three days later, the White House was releasing guidelines on how to start reopening the country after coronavirus shutdowns.

Trump argues over COVID death numbers President Trump argued in an interview that the US has better coronavirus death numbers than other countries if counted as a percentage of cases, not the total population. The interview was conducted by Axios, Courtesy HBO. (Aug. 4) AP

He also told Woodward in March that the virus posed a greater risk to young people than was initially thought. ""Plenty of young people,"" he said. He has told Americans repeatedly that children are at low risk as he pushed for schools to reopen.

The same day in February that Trump acknowledged to Woodward, ""This is deadly stuff,"" he tweeted that with warmer weather, the virus ""hopefully becomes weaker, and then gone"" after a conversation with President Xi Jinping of China.

CNN and The Washington Post reported that Woodward writes Robert O'Brien, national security adviser, informed Trump on Jan. 28 that the coronavirus would be ""the biggest national security threat you face in your presidency."" That got Trump's attention, according to Woodward.

Trump told Woodward in May that he didn't recall O'Brien saying that, but said, ""I'm sure he said it. Nice guy."" Trump declared certain travel restrictions on China a few days after O'Brien's reported remarks.

Experts warned that Trump's downplaying of the virus might have a negative impact on Americans' efforts to curb the spread. But Trump has largely blamed China for the spread of the virus in the United States.

""The virus has nothing to do with me,"" Trump told Woodward in July. ""It's not my fault. It's – China let the damn virus out.""

Democratic nominee Joe Biden slammed Trump for his comments to Woodward before a campaign event on Wednesday, calling it a ""life and death betrayal of the American people.""

""He knew and purposely played it down. Worse, he lied to the American people,"" Biden said. ""He knowingly and willingly lied about the threat it posed to the country for months.""

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in reaction to the revelations in Woodward's book that Trump is responsible for deaths because of his downplaying to the public.

""What he said about the virus early on, he understood better than he let on, when he was calling it a hoax, his delay, distortion and denial about the threat is responsible for many of the deaths and infections that we have today,"" Pelosi said Wednesday.

Woodward's book ""Rage"" is set for release on Sept. 15."	right
kfm44v	conservative	How to be a star in the GOP. Go on cable news shows and complain about how corrupt everything is but then never actually do anything about it.	"If you’ve been considering a career in politics, specifically the modern-day GOP, let me give you some tips on how to climb the ladder and then cement your place as a longstanding Republican member of Congress or the Senate.

The first and most important step is to become a mainstay on Conservative radio and cable news shows. Appearing on cable news shows is much more important than actually doing any work.

Think about it. When you’re in your office actually working for the people that voted for you, nobody can see it. It goes unnoticed. But when you go on cable news shows, everybody can see it. So the choice is clear, all your focus should be on cable news appearances.







But what should you say when you’re on those shows? Well, that’s easy. You need to sound exactly like the voters you are pandering to. Complain about out-of-control corruption, complain about overreaching laws, and complain about Democrats.

But you’re probably asking yourself. “Won’t the audience want me to fix all those things if I bring them up all the time?”

No! That’s the beauty of being in the GOP. Conservative voters are so desperate for someone in power to actually lend a voice to their beliefs that they’re happy to hear them being articulated in the media at all.

Complete media censorship has made it so Conservatives feel as though nothing they say can ever be spoken in public. So the bar is set so low all you have to do is agree with them and they’ll see you as a hero. You can complain all day but then never actually do anything about it. It’s the perfect win-win situation!

Senators like Lindsey Graham and Rand Paul have made a very profitable career out of this exact method. Simply go on TV and repeat what you read on Conservative message boards. Your clips and sound-bites will be shared far and wide and people will think you’re fighting the good fight even though you’ve never accomplished anything at all.







Unfortunately, you can’t run your whole career by doing 2 minute cable news show appearances. Eventually you’ll have to attend a Senate or Congressional hearing of some kind. But even though this comes dangerously close to real work, you can still use it as a great opportunity to grandstand and achieve nothing in the process other than produce content for some sweet viral video clips.

Here’s what you do, spend a few days perusing political message boards and look for some snappy and witty one-liners that will totally embarrass liberal talking points. Then, when it’s your turn to speak at the Senate hearing, pepper your prepared remarks with a few of these stolen zingers you got from the internet. Once again, these sound bites will go viral and you’ll be seen as a hero of the Conservative movement.

So if you’re considering a career in the GOP, make sure to follow the preceding advice. Remember, the goal isn’t too actually fix any of the problems you see, the goal is to trick voters into thinking you’re actually fighting for them when instead you’re just going along with all the corruption yourself.







Make sure to check back next week when we teach you how to use these same methods to rake in big cash through campaign donations!

He said: ""Rest assured I expect the president to continue carrying out his duties without disruption while recovering, and I will keep you updated on any future developments.""

Writing on Twitter, Mrs Trump said: ""As too many Americans have done this year, (the president) & I are quarantining at home after testing positive for COVID-19.

It said Mr Putin sent a message to the US president which read: ""I hope that your inherent vitality, good spirits and optimism will help you cope with the dangerous virus.""

Before testing positive for COVID-19, Mr Trump had said he and his wife were self-isolating after Hope Hicks, one of his top aides, had contracted the virus.

Ms Hicks, who serves as a counsellor to the president, is the closest aide to Mr Trump to test positive for coronavirus so far.

She had travelled with the president several times over the last week, including on presidential helicopter Marine One, and on Air Force One to Tuesday night's first presidential debate.

Mr Trump had earlier appeared to blame soldiers and law enforcement officials for Ms Hicks contracting the virus.

He told Fox News: ""It's very, very hard when you are with people from the military or from law enforcement and they come over to you and they want to hug you and they want to kiss you.

""You get close and things happen.""

Several White House staff members have tested positive for COVID-19 in recent months, including Mr Pence's press secretary Katie Miller, and one of the president's personal valets.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has tested negative for the virus, said he was reconsidering his upcoming trip to Asia as a precaution.

""We're taking this obviously very seriously,"" he said. ""We are praying for the president and first lady that they'll have a speedy recovery.""

According to his White House schedule, the president was due to host a phone call on Friday on ""COVID-19 support to vulnerable seniors"".

His positive test come as the virus continues to spread at an alarming rate in the US, even as Mr Trump has tried to downplay the threat of the disease.

More than 200,000 people have died in the US after contracting COVID-19 and more than seven million people in the country have been infected with the disease.

But Mr Trump has continued to hold campaign rallies which have drawn thousands of supporters during the pandemic.

His diagnosis now throws into question the nature of the rest of the campaign, including the remaining two presidential debates.

The next debate is scheduled for 15 October in Miami.

Two days before testing positive, during the first debate, Mr Trump belittled his Democratic challenger Joe Biden for frequently wearing masks and not having campaign rallies that matched his own in size.

The president continued to shake hands with visitors despite public health officials warning against it and also initially resisted being tested. Mr Trump also refused to wear a mask in public under almost all circumstances.

Domino’s Pizza announced on Monday it will give $1,200 to each of its more than 11,500 company-owned store and supply chain hourly employees, committing more than $9.6 million total.

“We have the honor and privilege of being open and operating throughout the US during this crisis, and we recognize that we could not be doing it without the hard work and dedication of our team members,” Domino’s chief executive Ritch Allison said in a statement. “This is our way of saying thank you to these remarkable people.”

The company said it previously “paid a special bonus to frontline workers at its corporate stores and supply chain centers earlier this year, while also providing paid time off to its part-time, frontline team members impacted by COVID-19.”

“We strive every day to uphold our values of doing the right thing and putting people first,” said Domino’s Chief Executive Officer Ritch Allison.

This will be the second bonus Domino’s has given its workers during the pandemic. The Delaware company has also offered paid time off to its employees this year.

The American multinational pizza restaurant also announced it is hiring thousands of more workers in the US. Most of Domino’s employees are employed by independent franchise owners, the company said.

Domino’s Pizza Inc., the largest pizza company in the world based on global retails sales, has been strong during the pandemic, particularly deliveries and takeout orders at its hundreds of take-out only locations

Robust earnings during the pandemic have caused a nearly 30% increase in the company’s shares this year against analysts’ expectations.

The oppression of Uighurs by China isn’t limited to telling them which jobs they need to work. The infringement on their liberties is total. Their existence is at the sufferance of Beijing. It’s a full-spectrum slave regime, replete with concentration camps.

And it’s getting worse, not better, as time goes on.

One might think corporate America, normally so quick to flash its woke consciousness during cultural disputes in the United States, would draw the line at honest-to-goodness slavery being practiced by the government of its manufacturing base. After all, some of these companies have devised whole advertising campaigns around the idea that sometimes you need to do what’s right even if it hurts your bottom line:

Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything. #JustDoIt pic.twitter.com/SRWkMIDdaO — Colin Kaepernick (@Kaepernick7) September 3, 2018

So why are they on the wrong side of a federal bill that would ban imported goods made by American companies that use Uighur slave labor?

[T]he legislation, called the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, has become the target of multinational companies including Apple whose supply chains touch the far western Xinjiang region, as well as of business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Lobbyists have fought to water down some of its provisions, arguing that while they strongly condemn forced labor and current atrocities in Xinjiang, the act’s ambitious requirements could wreak havoc on supply chains that are deeply embedded in China. Xinjiang produces vast amounts of raw materials like cotton, coal, sugar, tomatoes and polysilicon, and supplies workers for China’s apparel and footwear factories. Human rights groups and news reports have linked many multinational companies to suppliers there, including tying Coca-Cola to sugar sourced from Xinjiang, and documenting Uighur workers in a factory in Qingdao that makes Nike shoes… [F]or many companies, fully investigating and eliminating any potential ties to forced labor there has been difficult, given the opacity of Chinese supply chains and the limited access of auditors to a region where the Chinese government tightly restricts people’s movements.

Some companies, like Nike, have already issued statements insisting that they don’t source products from Xinjiang and have found no use of slave labor in their supply chains after conducting audits. The problem is that so many Uighurs are enslaved, with so much obfuscation of their enslavement by Beijing, that they simply can’t be sure if that’s true or not. Reportedly China has moved some Uighurs around the country to work in factories outside Xinjiang in order to solve the problem of a corporate “boycott” of that particular region. The issue, in other words, isn’t so much that American companies are knowingly using slave labor, it’s that there’s *so much* slave labor in China that they can’t be sure that there isn’t any somewhere in their supply chain. If the bill passes they might find themselves in violation of federal law at a moment’s notice after some international agency or major newspaper uncovers Uighur slaves working at a plant somewhere that provides materials to them.

“Firms were already responding [to the bill] by trying to find sources for products outside Xinjiang,” the Times notes, citing a lawyer. The real point of this legislation, I think, is not just to pressure companies to quit Xinjiang but to pressure them into quitting China altogether. That’s the only way they can have full confidence that they’re not using slave labor.

I wonder, though, if to some extent the corporate lobbying efforts are also a matter of PR designed to impress the Chinese government. We saw from the Daryl Morey episode last year that Beijing takes great exception to statements of solidarity with the victims of Chinese human-rights violations by American companies. They were willing to punish the NBA for one tweet by one GM. If Nike and Coke and whoever else got on board with a U.S. pressure campaign to end the enslavement of Uighurs, that might cost them their access to Chinese markets. “Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything” was never more than a slogan designed to sell sneakers.

Hopefully the Biden administration will make human rights in China more of a priority than the Trump administration did. As for corporate America, David French is right. If there were a scrap of doubt left that their wokeness is largely a marketing gimmick, this episode should erase it."	right

kp47rm	conservative	Bill to ban biological men from women's sports gains bipartisan support in Congress	"Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) introduced legislation to ban biological males from participating in women’s sports.

Gabbard, a Democrat who ran for the 2020 presidential nomination for her party, is the sponsor of H.R. 8932, the “Protect Women’s Sports Act,” alongside Reps. Markwayne Mullin, (R-Okla.), Bill Flores (R-Texas), Bill Johnson (R-Ohio), Rep. Alexander Mooney (R-W.V.), and Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.).

The legislation aims “to provide that for purposes of determining compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 in athletics, sex shall be determined on the basis of biological sex as determined at birth by a physician.”

In a joint press release with Mullin, Gabbard explained that Title IX “led to a generational shift that impacted countless women, creating life-changing opportunities for girls and women that never existed before.”

[RELATED: Cornell offers 'person of color' exemption for flu vaccine requirement]

“However, Title IX is being weakened by some states who are misinterpreting Title IX, creating uncertainty, undue hardship and lost opportunities for female athletes,” continued the congresswoman from Hawaii. “Our legislation protects Title IX’s original intent which was based on the general biological distinction between men and women athletes based on sex.”

“It is critical that the legacy of Title IX continues to ensure women and girls in sports have the opportunity to compete and excel on a level playing field,” she added.

Mullin added that “Title IX was designed to give women and girls an equal chance to succeed, including in sports. Allowing biological males to compete in women’s sports diminishes that equality and takes away from the original intent of Title IX.”

Title IX exists to ensure that “no person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance,” according to the U.S. Department of Education.

The Trump administration reversed Obama-era Title IX rules related to protecting due process for those accused of sexual assault in the summer of 2020, as Campus Reform previously reported.

Emilie Kao, director of the Heritage Foundation’s DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society, told Campus Reform that ""Rep. Gabbard took a courageous stand for fairness and female athletes around the country.”

“Biology matters in many areas,” she explained. “It matters in sports because it determines competitiveness, performance, and results. There is widespread bipartisan support for keeping male and female sports separate. Americans know that the law should protect fair competition by acknowledging the reality of sex differences.""

WASHINGTON — The House just voted to decriminalize cannabis, a historic symbolic moment marking Congress’ belated move toward embracing the views held by a large majority of Americans.

The House voted to pass the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act on Friday, the first time either chamber of Congress has ever voted on marijuana decriminalization.

The final vote was 228-164, with most Democrats joined by 5 Republicans and an independent to pass the legislation. Most Republicans and six Democrats opposed the bill.

The bill is a major symbolic victory for marijuana rights advocates and criminal justice reform. But it’s likely not going anywhere anywhere soon: Senate Republicans have indicated there’s no appetite to pass the measure.

While federal law on marijuana has been largely stagnant in recent decades, voters have been moving hard towards support of legalization across the country. Voters in four more states voted to legalize marijuana in the 2020 election—Arizona, Montana, New Jersey, and South Dakota—bringing the total number of states where marijuana is legal to 15, both red and blue states. Fully 38 states now allow medical marijuana, something that is still illegal at the federal level.

That’s a rapid shift: A decade ago, recreational marijuana was illegal in all 50 states.

Americans support marijuana legalization by a two-to-one margin, according to polls, numbers that have almost completely flipped in the past two decades. That support includes majorities of Republicans and vast majorities of Democrats and independents.

“We’re not rushing to legalize marijuana. The American people have already done that. We’re here because Congress has failed to deal with a disastrous war on drugs and do its part for the over 15 million marijuana users in every one of your districts,” said Rep. Earl Blumenauer, an Oregon Democrat and one of the bill’s chief architects, during House floor debate Friday morning before the vote. “It’s time for Congress to step up and do its part. We need to catch up with the rest of the American people.”

Democrats had initially planned to vote on the bill in September, with the goal of creating enthusiasm from pro-pot voters to turn out during the elections, but House leaders decided to delay it out of worries that it could backfire on some swing-state members.

The bill would remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act, allowing states to regulate it as they see fit. It would also expunge past convictions for marijuana possession and require resentencing for those in prison for pot convictions. It creates a federal tax on marijuana sales that would begin at 5 percent, funds which advocates say would be used to reinvest in communities that have suffered from the war on drugs.

The bill would also ban government agencies from using marijuana as a reason to deny people federally subsidized housing or to adversely impact their immigration status.

In spite of strong evidence of its medicinal properties, marijuana remains a Schedule I drug along with hard drugs like heroin."	right

PHOENIX, AZ—Local man Greg Chandler is worried that the government might put a tracking device in the vaccine.

He expressed his concerns on social media, furiously typing on his smartphone, which he carries literally everywhere he goes. The device is always either in his pocket, in his car, or in his hands. He says he's lucky he had it on him today, so that he could warn his social media followers of the government's sinister plan to track his every move.

""The government is putting tiny tracking microchips in the vaccine, and they can spy on you no matter where you go! Don't fall for this!"" he wrote on the Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram apps. ""We must stand up and say enough is enough! Big brother is watching you!""

He then recorded a short video rant which he posted to TikTok and checked in at the restaurant he was meeting some friends at.

WASHINGTON, D.C.—In a historic compromise, the Senate and U.S. House of Representatives have finally settled on a stimulus package for Americans struggling and out of work. In addition to bailouts, money for pet projects, and payouts to unions, Congress has authorized a very special $5 off coupon to Applebee's.

""We are proud to have come together for the American people,"" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. ""I am told that all those ditch diggers and plumbers in the Midwest are crazy about Applebee's! Won't this hit the spot after a long day of doing whatever it is you people do for a living? You're welcome!""

Some critics of the plan have suggested that giving Americans a coupon after forcing them to shut down their businesses for 9 months feels like a slap in the face. In response, Representative AOC said: ""Well, we wanted the stimulus payments to be eleventy-billion dollars for every person, but the evil Republicans didn't allow it!""

According to AOC, there is a silver lining in spite of the disappointing legislation. ""This is a great opportunity for Americans to try sex work!"" she said. ""Who needs a small business when you can just open an OnlyFans account?""

In a press release, Applebee's thanked the Government for its support. ""We are looking forward to serving all Americans at our fine dining establishments! Please note that the promotion expires on January 20th and we can only allow 3 patrons in our dining rooms at all times. We'll see you soon!""

U.S.—Americans have reported they're very optimistic about the stimulus package passed by Congress last week. In particular, people all around the country are excited to get paid with a little bit of the money that they paid the federal government already.

Americans from all walks of life said they couldn't wait to receive a check with a small percentage of the money the government had already taken from them.

""I can't wait to get that $1,200.00 check of my own money,"" said one man in Texas, rubbing his hands together. ""Surely this will get the economy back on track.""

From the rich to the poor, American citizens spent many hours dreaming of all the things they will spend their newfound riches on. ""With $1200, I could save enough to pay my taxes on time this year,"" said one woman in Los Angeles. ""Thanks so much, Congress. You're the real heroes here.""

A small percentage of the population said they thought it would be way more efficient for the economy if the government just didn't take the money in the first place. These people were shouted down as ""libertarian conspiracy theorist wackos"" and told to move to Somalia.

Sadly, by the time all the administration costs, government pet projects, and handouts were factored in, the stimulus each American was to receive became a negative amount, forcing Congress to raise taxes to pay for a new stimulus bill.

They picked Democrats voters for their interview, but one of the participants decided to blast President Biden and his administration.

The video couldn’t be seen on CNN anymore but internet sleuths managed to download the part of the video where the young Democrat Ben Calvert, 27 spoke against Biden and upload it again on YouTube.

Ben is fast losing faith with Democrats given that they are in charge in the White House, the Senate and the House. “A lot of my friends are really frustrated because they were like, ‘We’ve got to elect these two senators in Georgia! We’ve got to get Joe Biden in office and then everything’s going to be better! It’s not a $1,400 dollar check, it’s $2,000 checks,'” Ben said, making gloved air quotes.

“But now, they’re putting that stimulus check and minimum wage hike on the back burner while they’re dropping bombs in Syria. And those bombs are kind of expensive for a dude who owes me $2,000.”

Video below:

Joe Biden’s killed tens of thousands of energy jobs his first day in office when he canceled contracts with the Keystone XL pipeline.

Biden also bombed Syria to punish Iran for its attacks on US forces in Iraq.

Rep. Matt Gaetz blasted Biden yesterday for his broken promises: “Joe Biden has had more attacks on Syria than he’s had press conferences and so you have to ask the progressive voters, is this really what you expected?”

Joe Biden also promised that $2,000 checks would go out the door “immediately” if the Democrats won the senate – the $2,000 has turned into $1400 and the Democrats narrowed the eligibility for stimulus payments.

It looks like this Democrat voter learned the hard way that Joe Biden and the Democrat party say one thing on the campaign trail and do another when in office."	right

NEW: Outgoing @SecPompeo has determined the PRC's treatment of the Uyghur people constitutes ""genocide"" and ""crimes against humanity"" Senior State official says ""these designations are very rare"" and ""not taken lightly"" Sen @marcorubio gets specific thanks for his work — Emily Jashinsky (@emilyjashinsky) January 19, 2021

Following investigations into the CCP’s use of mass imprisonment of more than 1 million people, forced labor, forced sterilization, torture, and limits on religious freedom, freedom of expression, and freedom of movement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared that the United States has definitively evaluated and labeled these actions by the CCP as “crimes against humanity.”

“After careful examination of the available facts, I have determined that since at least March 2017, the People’s Republic of China (PRC), under the direction and control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), has committed crimes against humanity against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other members of ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang,” Pompeo said in a statement.

According to another senior State Department official, “these designations are very rare” and are “not taken lightly” by the government, but required action after the treatment of the Uighurs demonstrated “an affront to the Chinese people and the civilized world.”

One official also noted that while China tries to “portray itself as a normal rule-abiding state while doing everything on the ground to the opposite of that, whether it’s Hong Kong, the South China Sea, or you name it,” this designation tells a different story.

Senior State official calls the treatment of the Uyghurs ""an affront to the Chinese people and the civilized world"" — Emily Jashinsky (@emilyjashinsky) January 19, 2021

In light of the designation, Pompeo called for China “immediately to release all arbitrarily detained persons” as well as “abolish … all torture and abuse” of the Uighurs. The outgoing secretary also requested the assistance of other countries to “promote accountability for those responsible for these atrocities.”

The “bipartisan” resolution, announced just one day before President Donald Trump leaves office, follows years of debate about how to label and address China’s actions in the Xinjiang province. Most of the information, State Department officials noted, came from “open-source information,” with “extra steps” taken to verify it.

Pompeo also signaled the department’s intent to “continue to investigate and collect relevant information regarding the ongoing atrocities occurring in Xinjiang, and to make this evidence available to appropriate authorities and the international community to the extent allowable by law.”

Salih Hudayar, Prime Minister of the East Turkistan Government in Exile, praised the announcement, also urging other governments and the incoming Biden administration to join in taking action against China.

While CCP officials and Chinese propaganda outlets continue to deny that they are targeting the Muslim minority group, the United States already took action against the communist regime, previously banning the importation of certain products originating from Xinjiang and even blacklisting certain Chinese companies for enabling the violations.

Certain American companies such as Nike, Coca-Cola, and Apple recently came under fire after using their lobbying power to oppose the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, a bill prohibiting product imports manufactured in China using forced labor. The bill passed in the House with bipartisan support 406-3 and awaits approval from the Senate."	right

Rand Paul warned of a mass exodus from the Republican Party if GOP senators come together with Democrats to convict President Trump in a second impeachment trial, even after he leaves office next week.

The Kentucky Republican told Fox News host Laura Ingraham that he believes one-third of the party will leave if Trump's conviction comes to fruition. Paul added that he believes the second impeachment is ""purely a partisan thing.""

""I didn’t agree with the fight that happened last week. I voted against over-turning the election,"" Paul said Friday night. ""But at the same time, the impeachment is a wrongheaded, partisan notion. If Republicans go along with it, it will destroy the party. A third of the Republicans will leave the party.""

Trump was impeached by the Democrat-controlled House on Wednesday, after being charged with ""incitement of insurrection"" following the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol that left five people dead.

Ten House Republicans got on board to vote for Trump's impeachment, making him the first U.S. president in history to be impeached twice.

The president was impeached on two Ukraine-related articles of impeachment in the House in December 2019, but he was acquitted by the Senate early last year. At the time, Mitt Romney of Utah was the sole Republican senator to vote in favor of one of the articles of impeachment against Trump, becoming the first senator ever to vote for the impeachment of a president from the same party.

Convicting Trump in the Senate requires a two-thirds vote (or 67 senators). The Senate will be split 50-50 with Democrats and the two independents who caucus with them having a tie-breaker in Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.

Sixty-four percent of Republicans said they would be inclined toward joining a Trump-formed party like the “MAGA Party” or the “Patriot Party.” Among that figure, 32% said they would be very likely to join one. Thirty-six percent of respondents said they would be either somewhat or very unlikely to leave the GOP.

The survey was conducted among 340 registered Republicans between Jan. 28-29, with a margin of error of plus or minus 5.3 points.

Fifteen percent of Democrats and 28% of independents would be inclined to join the theoretical Trump-centered party, the poll found.

“These numbers show that despite the Capitol riots Trump remains a political force to be reckoned with,” said Dritan Nesho, CEO and chief pollster at HarrisX. “He benefits from a diverse base of support making up over a third of voters, voters who are attracted to him on a number of issues that are yet to be properly addressed by, and coopted by, Democratic and Republican elites.”

Of the voters surveyed, 37% said they would be likely to join a new political party started by the former president.

“If Trump were to split from the GOP and create his own party, polling suggests he might well create the second largest political party in the country, knocking the GOP down to third place,” Nesho said."	right
iaqm34	conservative	Trump says he is considering pardon for leaker Edward Snowden	"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday he is considering a pardon for Edward Snowden, the former U.S. National Security Agency contractor - now living in Russia - whose spectacular leaks shook the U.S. intelligence community in 2013.

FILE PHOTO: Edward Snowden speaks via video link during a news conference in New York City, U.S. September 14, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid

The Republican president's comments followed an interview here Trump gave to the New York Post this week in which he said of Snowden that ""there are a lot of people that think that he is not being treated fairly"" by U.S. law enforcement.

“I’m going to start looking at it,” Trump told reporters about a possible pardon, speaking at a news conference at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club.

U.S. authorities for years have wanted Snowden returned to the United States to face a criminal trial on espionage charges brought in 2013.

Snowden fled the United States and was given asylum in Russia after he leaked a trove of secret files in 2013 to news organizations that revealed vast domestic and international surveillance operations carried out by the NSA.

Snowden’s Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, told RIA news agency the United States should not simply pardon him, but should drop all possible prosecutions against Snowden as he had not commited any crimes.

“He was acting not only in the interest of the American citizens, but in the interest of all the humankind,” Kucherena said.

Trump’s softening stance toward Snowden represents a sharp reversal. Shortly after the leaks, Trump expressed hostility toward Snowden, calling him “a spy who should be executed.”

Trump said on Saturday he thinks Americans on both the political left and the right are divided on Snowden.

“It seems to be a split decision,” Trump told reporters. “Many people think he should be somehow treated differently. And other people think he did very bad things.”

DOMESTIC SPYING

Some civil libertarians have praised Snowden for revealing the extraordinary scope of America’s digital espionage operations including domestic spying programs that senior U.S. officials had publicly insisted did not exist.

But such a move would horrify many in the U.S. intelligence community, some of whose most important secrets were exposed. Trump has harshly criticized past leaders of the U.S. intelligence community and FBI, and on Thursday took aim at the bureau’s current director Christopher Wray, his own appointee.

The U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit last September against Snowden, arguing that the memoir he published last year, “Permanent Record,” violated non-disclosure agreements.

The Justice Department said Snowden published the book without submitting it to intelligence agencies for review, adding that speeches given by Snowden also violated nondisclosure agreements.

Trump’s use of his executive clemency powers including pardons has often benefited allies and well-connected political figures.

Last month he commuted the sentence of his longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone, sparing him from prison after he was convicted of lying under oath to lawmakers investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election to boost Trump’s candidacy."	right

Loyal members of the Chinese Communist Party are working in British consulates, universities and for some of the UK's leading companies, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

An extraordinary leaked database of 1.95 million registered party members reveals how Beijing's malign influence now stretches into almost every corner of British life, including defence firms, banks and pharmaceutical giants.

Most alarmingly, some of its members – who swear a solemn oath to 'guard Party secrets, be loyal to the Party, work hard, fight for communism throughout my life...and never betray the Party' – are understood to have secured jobs in British consulates.

Among them is a senior official at the British Consulate in Shanghai. Its headquarters is also home to intelligence officers from the UK security services.

The official describes their role as supporting ministers and officials on visits to East China.

Loyal members of the Chinese Communist Party are working in British consulates, universities and for some of the UK's leading companies, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. An extraordinary leaked database of 1.95 million registered party members reveals how Beijing's malign influence now stretches into almost every corner of British life, including defence firms, banks and pharmaceutical giants. (Pictured above, front, President Xi Jinping at a CCP session)

The database was originally leaked on Telegram, the encrypted instant messaging app, and passed in September by a Chinese dissident to the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, which comprises more than 150 legislators around the world who are concerned by the influence and activities of the Chinese government. Detailed analysis by MoS of the material reveals that pharmaceutical giants Pfizer and AstraZeneca – both involved in the development of coronavirus vaccines – employed a total 123 party loyalists

The analysis also revealed that there were more than 600 party members across 19 branches working at the British banks HSBC and Standard Chartered in 2016. Both have drawn criticism for their response to Beijing's crackdown in Hong Kong

Firms with defence industry interests including Airbus, Boeing and Rolls-Royce employed hundreds of party members, the analysis showed

While there is no evidence that anyone on the party membership list has spied for China – and many sign up simply to boost their career prospects – experts say it defies credulity that some are not involved in espionage. Responding to the findings, an alliance of 30 MPs last night said they would be tabling an urgent question about the issue in the Commons.

Writing in The Mail on Sunday today, former Tory Party leader Iain Duncan Smith says: 'This investigation proves that members of the Chinese Communist Party are now spread around the globe, with members working for some of the world's most important multinational corporations, academic institutions and our own diplomatic services.

'The Government must now move to expel and remove any members of the Communist Party from our Consuls throughout China. They can either serve the UK or the Chinese Communist Party. They cannot do both.'

Writing in The Mail on Sunday today, former Tory Party leader Iain Duncan Smith (above) says: 'This investigation proves that members of the Chinese Communist Party are now spread around the globe, with members working for some of the world's most important multinational corporations, academic institutions and our own diplomatic services'

The Foreign Office last night insisted that it has 'robust procedures in place to keep information secure and to vet staff at our overseas posts'. It is understood they are aware that they employ party members.

However, a senior Whitehall intelligence source said the revelations did raise security questions. 'In that station [the official] will be sat one floor away from the MI6 team and could have identified intelligence officers.'

The database was originally leaked on Telegram, the encrypted instant messaging app, and passed in September by a Chinese dissident to the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), which comprises more than 150 legislators around the world who are concerned by the influence and activities of the Chinese government.

Dating from 2016, it includes the names of party members in Shanghai, the largest city in China and its financial hub.

The list is divided into more than 79,000 branches, many of them affiliated to individual companies or organisations.

In total, the Chinese Communist Party has more than 92 million members, but competition to join is fierce with fewer than one in ten applicants successful.

After authenticating the material, with the help of data security analysts Internet 2.0, IPAC passed the database to four media organisations around the world, including The Mail on Sunday. Detailed analysis of it by this newspaper reveals that:

A party member who studied at St Andrews University worked at various consulates in Shanghai including that of the UK;

Chinese academics who swore the oath to assist the party attended British universities where they were involved in potentially sensitive areas of research including aerospace engineering and chemistry;

There were more than 600 party members across 19 branches working at the British banks HSBC and Standard Chartered in 2016. Both have drawn criticism for their response to Beijing's crackdown in Hong Kong;

The pharmaceutical giants Pfizer and AstraZeneca – both involved in the development of coronavirus vaccines – employed a total 123 party loyalists;

Firms with defence industry interests including Airbus, Boeing and Rolls-Royce employed hundreds of party members.

Security sources believe the initial data leak came from a dissident who targeted an outwardly unremarkable office block in Shanghai which housed the records.

Despite the near certainty of being executed for treason if caught, he or she probably accessed it via a server before downloading it on to a laptop and releasing it on Telegram where it was found by IPAC.

In total, the Chinese Communist Party has more than 92 million members, but competition to join is fierce with fewer than one in ten applicants successful. (Above, President Xi Jinping of China)

As well as the names of members, the database has places, dates of birth, Chinese ethnicity and in some cases addresses and telephone numbers.

The consular official is registered in a communist party branch within a company called the The Shanghai Foreign Agency Service Corporation, a state-owned employment agency.

Oath of loyalty which party members swear New members of the Chinese Communist Party swear an oath of loyalty in front of a traditional flag bearing a hammer and sickle to signify proletarian solidarity. With fist raised, they say: 'It is my will to join the Communist Party of China, uphold the Party's program, observe the provisions of the Party Constitution, fulfil a Party member's duties, carry out the Party's decisions, strictly observe Party discipline, guard Party secrets, be loyal to the Party, work hard, fight for communism throughout my life, be ready at all times to sacrifice my all for the Party and the people, and never betray the Party.' While there are 92 million members across China, this equates to just six per cent of the population. Indeed, competition is fierce with less than one in ten applicants accepted. The rewards are not purely ideological. Senior positions in business, academia and government are almost exclusively occupied by party members. Experts say that since coming to power in 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping has emphasised the importance of the Party with members compelled to attend more regular meetings and undergo appraisals.

It employs almost 2,000 people and its website says it 'provides comprehensive and high-quality services to more than 100 foreign organisations in Shanghai including foreign consulates, foreign news media, and foreign schools'.

Analysis of the data shows at least 249 Communist Party members were registered with the agency in 2016.

Academics on the membership list include some living and working in the UK. They include a research fellow in aerospace engineering at a leading university who also works for a private company.

Aerospace engineering is designated by the British Government as among the seven most militarily sensitive university subjects.

Students from countries that are not in the EU or the 'Five Eyes' network of Britain, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand are required to have an Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS) certificate.

During the application process, they are asked to declare any state-linked funding, although some security experts fear the vetting process is not stringent enough. The research fellow did not respond to a request for comment last night.

The US security services have been increasingly concerned about the threat of Chinese espionage on campuses.

In the nine months to September, 14 Chinese nationals were charged over alleged spying offences and the Trump administration last week changed its visa rules so members of the Chinese Communist Party and their families can stay or get travel documents for only a month.

Last week, John Ratcliffe, the US Director of National Security, warned that China posed the 'greatest threat to democracy and freedom' since the Second World War and was striving to dominate 'the planet economically, militarily and technologically'.

Australia revoked the visas of two professors from China in September amid suspicions they were involved in espionage. One of the men appears on the leaked membership list.

The database also reveals that party members work for many British and international companies in China, several involved in the defence or pharmaceutical industries.

Rolls-Royce, Boeing, Airbus and the French defence contractor Thales each have dozens of party members or more on their books while the British banking giants HSBC and Standard Chartered both have hundreds. Jaguar Land Rover was another company with staff who were members of the party.

Last week, John Ratcliffe (above), the US Director of National Security, warned that China posed the 'greatest threat to democracy and freedom' since the Second World War and was striving to dominate 'the planet economically, militarily and technologically'

Cosco, a major Chinese shipping firm, even has two branches in the UK for its seven members. Three are based at the port of Felixstowe, Suffolk, which receives almost half of Britain's container trade.

In total, the list for 2016 reveals 2,909 members working for Cosco across 118 branches worldwide.

None of the companies above said they banned members of the Chinese Communist Party from being employees.

There is no evidence that any of the firms named above has been targeted or fallen victim to espionage and each insists it has measures in place to protect data, staff and customers.

Reacting to the findings, former Foreign Office diplomat and China expert Matthew Henderson said: 'This is yet further proof of how China has inveigled its way into the British establishment. We are dancing with rabid wolves, intent on driving a wedge between Britain and America, overthrowing democracy and outstripping the West.'

Sam Armstrong, from the Henry Jackson Society foreign policy think-tank, said: 'This is a deeply disturbing illustration of China's spread across the globe which we can't look away from and must tackle head on.'

And a former CIA and White House intelligence analyst, who specialises in East Asia affairs, said: 'This is what the Chinese Communist Party is and you can't trust them. They're always looking for opportunities where they can take advantage of relationships, friendships, whatever, to further the interests of the Communist Party.'

However, Robbie Barnett, an affiliate of the Lau China Institute at King's College London and at London's School of Oriental and African Studies, said: 'It's not likely that many members in China actually believe in or care about Communism, so it's largely a nation-building project, not an ideological one.

'That's just one of the many reasons that a McCarthyist, catch-all approach doesn't make sense, even apart from the fact that it would be a gross abuse of people's human rights.'

Last night, a Chinese Embassy spokeswoman said: 'We urge the media to abandon ideological bias and Cold-War mentality and view China, the Communist Party of China and China's development in a rational and impartial manner.'

Chained: Media mogul who defied tyranny Handcuffed, bound in chains and flanked by police officers, businessman Jimmy Lai is led to court to face charges of colluding with foreign powers. The pro-democracy media mogul, one of the few business leaders in Hong Kong to speak out against the draconian new national security laws, was denied bail yesterday over allegations he had asked foreign countries to impose sanctions. Mr Lai, 73, owner of the pro-democracy tabloid Apple Daily and founder of Next Digital Media, has repeatedly called for international action over the erosion of liberties in Hong Kong. Crackdown: Pro-democracy businessman Jimmy Lai, chained round his waist and wrists to a guard, is marched to court yesterday The charges reportedly relate to tweets he posted, including one in May asking Donald Trump to impose sanctions on China, and his decision to launch an English-language edition of Apple Daily. Hong Kong politician Ted Hui, who lives in Britain after being forced into exile, told Radio 4's Today programme: 'I feel extremely heavy watching my friends go to jail, perhaps for life. Freedom of speech is totally collapsed in Hong Kong and it's extremely alarming to the world.' Mr Lai's arrest is the latest in a crackdown on Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement since the sweeping national security law passed this summer by Beijing, which allows Chinese security forces to operate there. Last week, activists Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam were jailed for taking part in an unauthorised protest last year. Teenage activist Tony Chung was also convicted last week of desecrating the Chinese flag, and at least 16 other activists were arrested. Advertisement

The devotee who works just yards from MI6 spies

Outwardly at least, the British consulate in Shanghai – at 17F Garden Square – appears wholly unremarkable. There is little to distinguish it from the other high-rise buildings that crowd the city's historic riverside district. What goes on inside, however, is quite a different matter.

One consular official identified in the leaked database is said by security sources to work near to a team of MI6 officers operating under diplomatic cover. Intriguingly, and some critics of the China's regime may think worryingly too, the official is apparently on the floor below or, as one security source put it, 'down a staircase'.

There is no evidence that anything untoward has taken place, but the simple fact that a Chinese Communist Party member is working in close proximity to intelligence officers has in itself given rise to concerns that the UK is 'playing with fire'.

Long known as a city of intrigue, Shanghai was fabled in the 1930s as the Paris of the East, China's most modern metropolis, a haven for gangsters and intellectuals, colonials and radicals, the new rich and the ultra-poor.

The communist revolution changed all that and the city's famous vitality was largely stamped out. Even in the late 1980s, when other parts of China were modernising fast, Shanghai lagged behind.

Now its appearance is positively futuristic. The skyscrapers in the gleaming financial district Pudong, for instance, dwarf the old colonial waterfront across the Huangpu river.

One senior Whitehall security source claimed: 'In that station [the official] will be sat one floor away from the security services team.

'In theory, anybody walking past where the official works and up the staircase could be identified as an intelligence officer and that information passed back to the Communist Party.'

IAIN DUNCAN SMITH: With hopeless naivety, big business and universities have failed to understand that China is out to destroy our way of life

By IAIN DUNCAN SMITH for the Mail on Sunday

Joining the ranks of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is quite unlike signing up for a political party here or in any other democracy. It might seem closer to joining a crime family in the New York Mafia.

Members have to swear overriding loyalty to the one party that has ruled in China since the 1940s.

They must pledge to 'guard party secrets', to 'fight for communism throughout my life' and to be ready at all times 'to sacrifice my all for the Party'. The oath is for life and sworn in the presence of party officials. Swift, harsh punishment would result should they ever dare to break it.

Belonging to the party is no mere formality. The CCP demands secrecy, cunning and utterly ruthless discipline from its millions of members. Notoriously secretive, its authority is absolute.

Joining the ranks of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is quite unlike signing up for a political party here or in any other democracy. It might seem closer to joining a crime family in the New York Mafia. Members have to swear overriding loyalty to the one party that has ruled in China since the 1940s

Members are routinely schooled in the beliefs, tenets and principles of Chinese Communist thought.

Democracy and freedom are such existential threats, for example, that violence and oppression are necessary to quash them. Western nations such as the UK are locked in mortal conflict with China and must be defeated.

It is a party whose beliefs about religious minorities remind us of the racist policies of the worst dictators of the 20th Century.

The CCP sees nothing wrong with rounding up Uyghur Muslims, placing them on trains and carting them to 're-education camps' where women can be sterilised and the men put to forced work.

Each and every member has subscribed to all of this and more – harvesting organs from religious minorities, locking up lawyers, crushing the spirit of its own people. There is little room for deviation in political thought in Xi Jinping's Chinese Communist Party.

It would be bad enough were these individuals confined to China, where they have a vice-like grip on political power.

However, The Mail on Sunday's investigation shows that CCP influence is spreading around the globe, with members working for some of the world's most important multinational corporations, academic institutions and even our own diplomatic services.

Much of their spread into the UK took place under the so-called Golden Era, or project Kow Tow, as I prefer to call it. The UK welcomed China, believing – wrongly – that China would open up its economy and that Chinese investment would bring welcome growth, investment, and prosperity to the UK.

It is hardly surprising, then, that City of London behemoths Standard Chartered, KPMG and Ernst & Young each hired several hundred CCP members across several branches in China.

And it is even less surprising that HSBC tops the shameful league table of companies willing to comply with Chinese Communist Party rules. HSBC likes to criticise Brexit for its perceived small-mindedness, with adverts telling the UK 'we are not an island'.

It is a party whose beliefs about religious minorities remind us of the racist policies of the worst dictators of the 20th Century. The CCP sees nothing wrong with rounding up Uyghur Muslims, placing them on trains and carting them to 're-education camps' where women can be sterilised and the men put to forced work. (Above, a protest in Mumbai, India)

Its own behaviour speaks volumes, however. Last week, it rushed to freeze the bank accounts of exiled Hong Kong lawmaker Ted Hui. Earlier in the summer, it issued statements denouncing the democracy protests.

Now we learn that it apparently once employed more than 300 members of the very party that is orchestrating the draconian crackdown in Hong Kong. Time and again, HSBC has proved itself to be Beijing's favourite bank.

None of this would be remarkable in a Chinese institution but for a British bank – regulated and headquartered here in London – it is inexcusable.

The conduct of HSBC and other UK financial institutions is not just wrong but immoral.

We can only hope that this leak confirms the truth that is beginning to dawn on businesses around the world. Operating in China carries an inbuilt ethical and reputational risk. We already know that household brands have been linked with slave labour from Uyghur prison camp detainees in the Xinjiang region.

Mounting evidence links the Party to state-sponsored concentration camps and genocide against Uyghur minorities.

So when will rich multinational firms decide it is no longer worth the damage to their brand?

The threat is not just to their corporate image, by the way, or to our moral standing as a nation – it is a threat to our security. Companies such as Boeing, Airbus, Thales, and Rolls-Royce each play an essential role in manufacturing equipment used by our Armed Forces.

They make some of our most advanced weaponry and are trusted to guard top-secret designs for our most sensitive assets and facilities. Yet collectively they employ hundreds of Chinese Communists who have pledged to serve the Party above all else.

Other vital firms such as Pfizer, AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline employ hundreds of Communist Party members, giving them access to networks, designs and supply chains.

Then there is the matter of academics in the UK, some of whom are studying among the most sensitive subjects at our universities.

In recent years we've come to understand that China is systematically targeting – and stealing – academic technology.

In September, our Government barred Chinese military scientists from sensitive research. Now we know why.

Most troubling of all is the discovery that this scourge extends to our own Foreign Office.

Applicants to the FO are among the most closely vetted in Government, and rightly so. Staff in our consulates and embassies will see and discuss matters of state.

They are rightly considered among the most useful potential 'assets' by foreign intelligence services. Even the most anodyne pieces of information can have implications for national security.

So the Foreign Office will need to explain to the public and to Parliament how it is that we employed lifelong members of the Chinese Communist Party in one of the most sensitive facilities in the UK diplomatic network, the consulate in Shanghai.

An urgent investigation must now take place into exactly what sort of access this individual – and other Communist Party Members – have had.

I believe the Government must now move to expel and remove any members of the Communist Party from our consulates in China. They can serve the UK or they can serve the CCP. They cannot do both.

There is a common theme of naivety running through our companies, universities, and government officials.

We have failed to recognise that at the core of China's system is a system of ideas and values that not only runs contrary to ours but seeks to overcome it. The interests of the Communist Party come first.

It is not that China has sought to hide this reality but that we in the free world have been prepared to turn a blind eye to it for so long.

Small wonder, then, that Xi Jinping states openly that China will have the world's most powerful military forces in the world by 2049.

The question today is this: to what degree have our institutions and big business been helping him achieve his goal?"	right

igcc7h	conservative	Bill Would Ban Gender Reassignment Procedures on Minors	"The BBC reported back in March on a lawsuit against the United Kingdom’s leading gender identity clinic, with a detransitioned female patient stating that she was rushed into irreversible hormonal interventions that she later came to regret.

It’s with cases like this in mind that Rep. Doug LaMalfa, R-Calif., has introduced legislation that would prohibit these procedures from being performed on minors in this country.

“I should have been challenged on the proposals or the claims that I was making for myself,” 23-year-old Keira Bell said of her lawsuit. “And I think that would have made a big difference as well. If I was just challenged on the things I was saying.”

Bell’s lawsuit comes in the wake of the resignation of whistleblowers at the clinic who raised concerns about the massive increase in the number of children—especially girls—referred for medical intervention with insufficient evaluation of the risks or other underlying factors contributing to the patients’ gender dysphoria.

The U.K.’s minister for women and equalities recently announced plans to ban transgender medical interventions for those under 18.

To protect American children from those harms, LaMalfa introduced a bill Aug. 11 to prevent these unproven and unethical medical interventions from being performed on minors in the United States.

The legislation, HR 8012, marks an important step in the fight against politicized medicine that results in irreparable harm to children.

Performing hormonal or surgical interventions on minors because they are experiencing discomfort with their bodies is a serious breach of medical ethics and leaves young patients with irreversible consequences.

As Ryan T. Anderson and Robert P. George have written:

Whatever one may think about the ethics of medical professionals’ ‘transitioning’ adults, everyone should be able to agree that adults should not interfere with the natural, healthy development of the bodies and minds of children. Children must be provided with the time and space to develop to maturity. To tell a child that he or she is of the opposite sex (or both, or neither—something underwritten today by standard children’s ‘gender’ books), or to encourage a child’s mistaken belief that he is something other than a boy, or she something other than a girl (however sensitively one may, and should, be handling such a situation), is deeply unjust to that child. To intervene in a child’s physical development, to block the child from going through normal puberty—all in an attempt to ‘affirm’ a ‘gender identity’ that rejects bodily reality—is profoundly unethical.

Contrary to activists’ talking points, the effects of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones are neither risk-free nor reversible.

The drugs commonly used to delay normally timed puberty in children who identify as transgender have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for that purpose, and there are no long-term studies to support their safety or effectiveness in treating gender dysphoria.

There is evidence, however, demonstrating that these drugs have long-lasting negative side effects, such as reduced bone density and delayed brain development.

Administering estrogen to boys or testosterone to girls eventually results in permanent sterility—a consequence that children are in no way equipped to consent to or even fully grasp the implications of.

The evidence further suggests that medical transition does not carry the promised benefits for the health of gender dysphoric children.

The authors of the largest study to date on the mental health outcomes of individuals who have undergone sex-reassignment surgery or hormonal transition were forced to admit that the data showed no decrease in mood or anxiety disorders for those who transitioned medically.

In fact, individuals who underwent surgery were more likely to be treated for anxiety disorders than those who did not.

Placing children on the path to transition also creates a self-fulfilling prophecy.

The majority of children who transition socially eventually transition medically, and almost all children placed on supposedly reversible puberty blockers go on to take cross-sex hormones.

In contrast, 80% to 95% of minors with gender dysphoria who do not transition either socially or medically come to accept their bodies.

In America, the introduction of HR 8012 represents a growing legal and legislative pushback against transgender ideology in medicine around the world.

Policymakers in the United States should carefully consider the abundant evidence that medical transitioning harms children and should work to protect them from the devastating consequences of abandoning sound medicine for ideology."	right
k0r668	conservative	Fox News daytime ratings drop by 32% in two weeks since the election	"Cable news network behemoth Fox News dipped in viewership among a key demographic in recent ratings reports, and lost 32% of viewership in daytime.

Nielsen Media Research said that CNN took both top spots among the 25-54 age demographic during primetime on Friday. Anderson Cooper's show, ""AC360,"" took the time spot with 604K viewers. Chris Cuomo's CNN show took the second highest slot.

Fox News' total viewership also fell an astounding 32% in the two weeks after the Nov. 3 election compared to its viewership the two weeks before the election.

While Fox News' viewership dropped, the viewership for CNN and MSNBC increased to near parity. In weekday average daytime viewership, Fox News garnered 1.63 million viewers, CNN received 1.68 million viewers, and MSNBC received 1.71 million viewers.

But despite the precipitous drop in daytime, Fox continues to beat the competition in total numbers of viewers during prime-time hours.

Fox News averaged 2.98 million viewers in prime time, with CNN averaging 2.05 million, and MSNBC seeing an average of 2.18 million viewers.

Critics of Fox News have excoriated the network after they called the state of Arizona for former Vice President Joe Biden on election night while most other outlets were saying the results were too close to call. The state has since been called for Biden by the mainstream news outlets.

President Trump has also turned on the cable news network and has been criticizing Fox News in favor of some of its lesser known competitors. In one instance, he appeared to refer to himself as the ""Golden Goose"" and blamed them for the 2020 election.

""Very sad to watch this happen, but they forgot what made them successful, what got them there. They forgot the Golden Goose,"" the president tweeted.

""The biggest difference between the 2016 Election, and 2020, was @FoxNews!"" he added.



In another missive sent out in March, the president accused Fox News of not doing enough to get him and other Republicans re-elected.

Some viewers have posted on social media that they are actively seeking alternative sources of news, including the YouTube channel of BlazeTV host Steven Crowder.

lq1e3w	conservative	Canada votes to recognize China’s treatment of Uighur population as genocide	"Canada has become the second country in the world to describe China’s treatment of its Uighur minority as a genocide, following a contentious parliamentary vote which is likely to further raise diplomatic tensions between the two nations.

Lawmakers approved the non-binding motion, brought forward by opposition Conservatives, to recognize China’s actions in the north-western Xinjiang province as a genocide against Muslim Uighurs.

Prime minister Justin Trudeau and senior members of cabinet did not attend the vote on Monday. All other Liberal members present voted in favour of the motion, except the foreign affairs minister, Marc Garneau, who abstained on behalf of the government.

By calling the actions in China a genocide, Canada joins the United States, which made the determination shortly before Donald Trump left office. A similar attempt on a vote in the UK failed earlier this month.

But the move by the Canadian parliament is likely to bring a host of new political challenges for the prime minister, who has tried in recent years to strike a balance between pushing back against China’s hostilities and maintaining cordial relations with Beijing.

Trudeau, whose Liberal party governs without a parliamentary majority, had previously spoken out against bringing the motion to a vote, telling reporters that genocide was an “extremely loaded” term and that more study of the issue was needed before a determination could be made.

Over the weekend, China’s ambassador to Canada criticized the vote, telling the Canadian Press that officials in Ottawa should stay out of China’s internal politics.

“We firmly oppose that because it runs counter to the facts. And it’s like, you know, interfering in our domestic affairs,” said Cong Peiwu. “There’s nothing like genocide happening in Xinjiang at all.”

More than 1 million Uighurs have been detained in camps in Xinjiang province, and reports have emerged of systematic rape and sexual violence. China denies such allegations and describes the facilities as vocational and educational training centres, saying it is trying to stamp out extremism.

But last October, a Canadian parliamentary subcommittee determined that China’s treatment of Uighurs constituted a genocide.

The motion is likely to escalate tensions between the two countries, whose relationship has already undergone significant strain since the arrest on a US warrant of Huawei’s Meng Wanzhou in December 2018. Within days, two Canadian citizens – Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor – were detained in China.

Canada has described the men’s detention as “hostage diplomacy”.

Ahead of the vote, the Conservative leader, Erin O’Toole, had said the motion was necessary to send a “clear and unequivocal signal that we will stand up for human rights and the dignity of human rights, even if it means sacrificing some economic opportunity”.

The Conservatives, New Democrats, Bloc Québécois and Greens have all called for sanctions against Chinese officials and for the upcoming Olympic Winter Games to be moved from Beijing."	right
j7hq3v	conservative	Six people charged after allegedly plotting to abduct, kill Michigan Gov. Whitmer	"The FBI uncovered a plot by an armed militia in Michigan to kidnap Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, it annnounced Thursday.

Seven members of militia group Wolverine Watchmen, or associates of Wolverine Watchmen, face 19 state felony charges filed by Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel. Separately, six individuals were charged by U.S. Attorney Andrew Birge with federal felonies following search warrants executed Wednesday.

WHITMER RAILS AGAINST MICHIGAN SUPREME COURT FOR STRIKING DOWN 2 CORONAVIRUS EMERGENCY ACTS

The suspects, now under arrest, are accused of calling on the groups’ members to identify the homes of law enforcement officers in order to target them; making threats of violence to instigate a civil war leading to societal collapse; and engaging in planning and training for an operation to attack the state Capitol and kidnap government officials, including Gov. Whitmer.

“There has been a disturbing increase in anti-government rhetoric and the re-emergence of groups that embrace extremist ideologies,” Nessel said. “These groups often seek to recruit new members by seizing on a moment of civil unrest and using it to advance their agenda of self-reliance and armed resistance. This is more than just political disagreement or passionate advocacy, some of these groups’ mission is simply to create chaos and inflict harm upon others.”

Through the efforts of more than 200 state and federal law enforcement officials, officers executed a series of search warrants and arrest warrants in more than a dozen Michigan cities, including Belleville, Cadillac, Canton, Charlotte, Clarkston, Grand Rapids, Luther, Munith, Orion Township, Ovid, Portage, Shelby Township and Waterford, according to a press release.

Paul Bellar, Shawn Fix, Eric Molitor, Michael Null, William Null, Pete Musico and Joseph Morrison are all facing state-related terrorism charges connected to the militia plot. The six individuals facing federal charges, accused of conspiring to kidnap the governor are Adam Fox, Barry Croft, Ty Garbin, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, and Brandon Caserta.

TRUMP CANCELING ADS IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES, MOVING MONEY SOUTH

“Michigan law enforcement officers are united in our commitment to rooting out terrorism in any form and we will take swift action against anyone seeking to cause violence or harm in our state,” stated Col. Joe Gasper, director of the Michigan State Police.

In early 2020, the FBI learned through social media that a group was discussing a violent overthrow of certain government and law enforcement components, according to the criminal complaint obtained by Fox News.

Among those individuals were Croft and Fox. Through electronic communications, Croft and Fox agreed to unite others and take violent action against multiple state governments that they believe are violating the U.S. Constitution.

The criminal complaint also lays out the group's efforts to train for an attack, including, ""firearms training and other combat drills."" They met several times in Dublin, Ohio, and Lansing, Mich. At one meeting in Cambria, Wisc., they also tried to construct an IED; however, ""The construction of the devices was faulty, and they did not detonate as planned.""

Those who attended the meetings were told to leave if they were not willing to participate in attacks against the government and in kidnapping politicians. Franks also brought and fired a rifle with a silencer at the combat exercises, attendees shared photos and video recordings of the exercise on Facebook.

During phone calls monitored by the FBI, Fox said he needed 200 men to storm the Capitol in Lansing to take hostages, including the governor of Michigan for “treason,” and he said they would execute the plan before the 2020 elections.

kdnsek	conservative	Homeowner shoots all four armed men who broke into his house — two of them fatally. Surviving suspects face murder charges for accomplices' deaths.	"It appears to be yet another case of crime suspects getting charged with murder when their accomplices are fatally shot by the crime victim.

What are the details?

A Louisiana homeowner had just about all he could handle last Tuesday morning when four men carrying guns invaded his residence in Lacombe, WVUE-TV reported. Lacombe is about an hour's drive north of — and directly across Lake Pontchartrain from — New Orleans.

Thing is, the homeowner also had a gun — and used it far more successfully than the quartet of intruders. The homeowner, in fact, shot all four suspects, killing two of them during the ensuing shootout.

The St. Tammany Coroner's office identified the dead suspects as 25-year-old Renard Causey Jr. and 21-year-old Justin Hill, WVUE added.

But now the two suspects who survived the shooting — Renard Causey Sr. and Jason Leblanc — both face charges of first-degree murder, armed robbery, and home invasion, the station reported in a follow-up story.

Both men will be booked after they are released from a hospital, WVUE reported.



The homeowner's 4-year-old daughter apparently was struck by a bullet in the crossfire, the station said, adding that family members said she received an operation and is expected to be OK.

The homeowner also is expected to be OK, and WVUE added that deputies say the homeowner won't face charges at this time. A relative told WVUE the homeowner may have been pistol-whipped before he fired at the intruders.

St. Tammany Sheriff's deputies are investigating the incident, the station said.

Anything else?

WVUE said the community on Palmer Drive is close — the kind of place where everyone either is related or has known each other for years — and many are stunned by what happened.

""It was late morning and we heard patrol cars, one after another and detective cars and then there would be ambulances,"" Shannon Bordelon told the station. ""There were several dozen emergency vehicles involved.""



Neighbors aded to WVUE that they waited 24 hours to learn about the shooting, but sheriff's officials said they didn't want to put out information sooner that might impede the investigation."	right

k0wrot	conservative	Trump 1st President Since Carter Not to Send Troops Into New Conflict	"President Donald Trump will likely become the first president since Jimmy Carter to not send American forces into a new conflict once he leaves office, Newsweek reports.

Trump’s recently-appointed acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller announced last week that the U.S. will cut the number of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan to 2,500 by Jan. 15, an announcement that came just before national security adviser Robert O’Brien said that Trump was looking “to put a stop to America’s endless wars.”

Although the United States has formally declared war only five times, with the most recent being the country’s entry into World War II, Congress has granted several “authorizations of military force” since Carter left office.

President Ronald Reagan sent troops into Lebanon in 1983, President George H.W. Bush launched the Gulf War in 1991, President Bill Clinton got funding from Congress and permission from the United Nations to send 20,000 troops into Bosnia in 1995, George W. Bush initialized the War on Terror and the Iraq War in 2003, and President Barack Obama sent American forces into Libya in 2011.

According to Thomas Gift, the director of the Centre on U.S. Politics at University College London, ""Trump hasn't faced a similar monumental national security event that's compelled him to shift focus and become a 'wartime president.' As a result, Trump's brand of belligerent isolationism has led him to avoid foreign wars."""	right
lakxp4	conservative	Mitch McConnell rips Marjorie Taylor Greene: ‘A cancer for the Republican Party’	"WASHINGTON — Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell denounced newly elected Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on Monday, calling the far-right Georgia Republican’s embrace of conspiracy theories and “loony lies” a “cancer for the Republican Party.”

“Somebody who’s suggested that perhaps no airplane hit the Pentagon on 9/11, that horrifying school shootings were pre-staged, and that the Clintons crashed JFK Jr.’s airplane is not living in reality,” said McConnell, R-Ky. “This has nothing to do with the challenges facing American families or the robust debates on substance that can strengthen our party.”

The statement comes as House Democrats are mounting an effort to formally rebuke Greene, who has a history of making racist remarks, embracing conspiracy theories and endorsing violence directed at Democrats. It also puts pressure on House Republican leaders to discipline her.

Democrats have teed up action Wednesday to send a resolution to the House floor that would strip Greene of assignments on the House education and budget committees, if House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., doesn’t do so first.

“It is my hope and expectation that Republicans will do the right thing and hold Rep. Greene accountable, and we will not need to consider this resolution,” said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md. “But we are prepared to do so if necessary.”

Some Democrats have called for going further and expelling Greene from the House – an unlikely outcome that would require backing from Republicans, since expulsion requires a two-thirds vote. Another option is censure.

Democrats’ willingness to act against a member of the opposing party underscores their desire to confront far-right politicians, like Greene, who are closely aligned with some of former President Donald Trump’s fringe supporters, including extremist groups that were involved in the violent Capitol insurrection. It also shines a light on the GOP’s reluctance to punish Trump supporters in their ranks for fear of alienating some of the former president’s most ardent voters.

“If Republicans won’t police their own, the House must step in,” said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., who is sponsoring the measure to remove Greene from the committees.

In a tweet over the weekend, Greene sounded a defiant tone. She also said she had spoken to Trump and was “grateful for his support.”

“I will never back down and will stand up against the never ending blood thirsty mob,” she tweeted.

On Monday, she tweeted that Democrats, if they move forward, will come to regret the “precedent they are setting,” arguing that it would be “used extensively against members on their side once we regain the majority after the 2022 elections.”

Greene‘s views were in the spotlight even before she joined the House last month.

The Georgia Republican has expressed support for QAnon conspiracy theories, which focus on the debunked belief that top Democrats are involved in child sex trafficking, Satan worship and cannibalism. Facebook videos surfaced last year showing she’d expressed racist, anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim views. Top Republicans denounced her at the time, hoping to block her from capturing the GOP nomination in her reliably red congressional district in northwest Georgia.

But after she won her primary, they largely accepted her. Since then, even more of her past comments, postings and videos have been unearthed, though many were deleted recently after drawing attention.

She “liked” Facebook posts that advocated violence against Democrats and the FBI. One suggested shooting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the head. In response to a post raising the prospect of hanging former President Barack Obama, Greene responded that the “stage is being set.”

In an undated video posted online, Greene floated a conspiracy theory that falsely suggests that the 2017 mass shooting that killed 58 people at a country music festival in Las Vegas could have been a false flag operation to build support for gun control legislation.

“How do you get avid gun owners and people that support the Second Amendment to give up their guns and go along with anti-gun legislation?” Greene said in the video. “You make them scared, you make them victims and you change their mindset and then possibly you can pass anti-gun legislation. Is that what happened in Las Vegas?”

She also “liked” a Facebook post that challenged the veracity of a 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Another video captured her confronting Parkland school shooting survivor David Hogg.

After her election, she seized on Trump’s false claims that the election was stolen and cheered on his supporters the day before the Capitol was stormed.

“It’s our 1776 moment!” she posted on the conservative friendly social media platform Parler.

Last week, Pelosi pressed for House Republicans to take action against Greene.

“Assigning her to the education committee, when she has mocked the killing of little children” in Newtown, “what could they be thinking, or is thinking too generous a word for what they might be doing?” Pelosi said of Republican leaders. “It’s absolutely appalling.”

McCarthy is supposed to meet privately with Greene this week. A spokesperson for the Republican leader declined to comment on Monday.

Although it’s not certain he will take action against Greene, McCarthy has punished members of the House Republican caucus before. Former Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, was stripped of all his committee assignments after expressing support for white supremacists in 2019.

Wasserman Schultz acknowledged Monday that it had long been left up to leaders to remove members of Congress of their own party of their committee assignments. But she said Republicans’ reluctance to take action left Democrats with little choice.

“Rep. Greene‘s appalling behavior both before her election and during her term has helped fuel domestic terrorism, endangered lives of her colleagues and brought shame on the entire House of Representatives,” Wasserman Schultz said. “Based on her actions and statements and her belligerent refusal to disavow them, she should not be permitted to participate in the important work of these two influential committees.”

mip99w	conservative	Rep. Matt Gaetz's communications director steps down amid federal investigation of congressman	"Rep. Matt Gaetz's communications director has left the office of the Florida Republican amid a federal criminal probe into whether the congressman paid women for sex.

Luke Ball, the former spokesman for the congressman, parted ways with Gaetz this week just as more reporting revealed Gaetz's alleged involvement with women who were recruited online for sex.

""The Office of Congressman Matt Gaetz and Luke Ball have agreed that it would be best to part ways,"" Gaetz's office said in a statement to Fox News. ""We thank him for his time in our office, and we wish him the best moving forward.""

Ball did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment on whether he resigned out of principle, as was suggested by another news outlet.

MATT GAETZ CASE GETS MORE BIZARRE AS EXTORTION CLAIM INVOLVES SEARCH FOR MISSING EX-FBI AGENT ROBERT LEVINSON

Gaetz, a one-time rising star in the GOP and outspoken ally for former President Donald Trump, has denied the allegations of sexual misconduct and for paying for sex.

REP. MATT GAETZ DENIES ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT IN 'TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT' EXCLUSIVE

The New York Times reported Friday that the investigation into Gaetz is tied to a probe of an indicted Florida politician named Joel Greenberg and focuses on their alleged involvement with multiple women who were recruited online for sex and received cash payments.

Greenberg is a former tax collector in Seminole County, Fla., who was indicted last year on a federal sex trafficking charge. Greenberg allegedly met the women through websites that connect people who go on dates in exchange for gifts, fine dining, travel and allowances, The Times reported. Gaetz met the women through Greenberg and allegedly had sex with them, the newspaper reported.

MATT GAETZ UNDER DOJ INVESTIGATION RELATED TO POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIP WITH 17-YEAR-OLD GIRL: REPORT

In addition to payments to the women through the mobile payment service Cash App, the Justice Department (DOJ) is also investigating whether Gaetz had sex with a 17-year-old minor and whether she received anything of material value in return, sources familiar with the investigation told The Times.

""Matt Gaetz has never paid for sex,"" Gaetz's office said in a statement to newspaper. ""Matt Gaetz refutes all the disgusting allegations completely. Matt Gaetz has never ever been on any such websites whatsoever. Matt Gaetz cherishes the relationships in his past and looks forward to marrying the love of his life.""

In an interview with Fox News' Tucker Carlson this week, Gaetz denied any allegations of wrongdoing and claimed that he was the target of an extortion attempt.

Gaetz told Carlson that his family had notified the FBI about the alleged extortion, naming former federal prosecutor David McGee as being behind it. Gaetz said his father had worn a wire during a meeting as part of an investigation of the extortion claim, and that he believes The Times story had been leaked in order to thwart that investigation.

mjve1x	conservative	Charles Barkley says politicians 'divide and conquer' based on race to 'keep their grasp on money and power'	"Charles Barkley says politicians seek to divide people based on race to ""keep their grasp on money and power.""

Barkley, a former athlete who is an analyst on Inside the NBA, said he finds ""most white people and black people are great people,"" but politicians benefit by pitting them against one another.

""I think our system is set up where our politicians, whether they're Republicans or Democrats, are designed to make us not like each other, so they can keep their grasp [on] money and power,"" he said during a CBS broadcast prior to Saturday evening's March Madness games. ""They divide and conquer.""

SOCIALIST DEPUTY MAYOR OF PARIS SAYS WHITE PEOPLE SHOULD 'BE ASKED TO KEEP QUIET' ON RACE ISSUES

Barkley said politicians don't have to live with the consequences of racial division because they don't live in the neighborhoods affected by their actions.

""We are so stupid, following our politicians, whether they are Republicans or Democrats, and their only job is, 'Hey, let's make these people not like each other. We don't live in their neighborhoods. We've all got money. Let's make the whites and blacks not like each other. Let's make rich people and poor people not like each other. Let's scramble the middle class.' I truly believe that in my heart,"" he added.

The subjects of race and diversity have gained renewed scrutiny in the wake of a new voting law in Georgia that critics argue will hamper voting access for racial minorities.

""There is no middle ground here. You either are for more people voting, or you want to suppress the vote,"" Kenneth Chenault, a former chief executive of American Express, said while pressuring Georgia-based corporations to oppose the new legislation. ""This impacts all Americans, but we also need to acknowledge the history of voting rights for African-Americans. And as African American executives in corporate America, what we were saying is we want corporate America to understand that, and we want them to work with us.""

Many corporations with ties to the state issued statements condemning the new law, and Major League Baseball announced on Friday that it would move its All-Star Game and 2021 draft from Atlanta in protest, a move celebrated by many on the Left, including former President Barack Obama.

""Home run,"" actress Ellen Barkin tweeted in response to the news.

ks258w	conservative	Pence, Not Trump, Gave Order to Activate National Guard: Report	"Photo: Jim Lo Scalzo - Pool/Getty Images

After an hours-long delay, 150 D.C. National Guard troops were sent to the U.S. Capitol to help law-enforcement efforts to remove Trump supporters who had violently seized the building in an act of insurrection. Such an order would usually be given by the president and commander-in-chief, but according to Pentagon officials who spoke with the New York Times, it was approved by Vice-President Mike Pence.

It’s not clear what caused this upending of the chain of command, which came after President Trump encouraged protesters to head to the Capitol to protest the certification of election results, did not explicitly condemn the attack, and said in a video that he “loves” his supporters who stormed the Capitol.

Pence’s order came hours after the president condemned him for not having “the courage” to stop the certification of the election in Congress on Wednesday — a power that the vice-president does not possess. In his speech before protesters early on Wednesday afternoon, Trump also lashed out at his vice-president before encouraging the crowd to “walk down Pennsylvania Avenue” to the U.S. Capitol, where a handful of Republican senators and more than 100 House representatives planned to object to the election results. The symbolic process was interrupted by the violent act of Trump supporters, which has reportedly resulted in four deaths.

hswxo7	conservative	Trump considering banning all Chinese Communist Party members and their families from US	"President Donald Trump and members of his administration are in the early stages of discussing plans to block members of the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from entering the U.S., according to four sources familiar with the discussions who spoke with The New York Times.

Trump has not yet signed off a decision, and officials were reportedly considering a number of questions about the limit of the visa ban. The Wall Street Journal, also reporting on the potential order, indicated open questions about the extent of the ban included whether the ban would apply to all CCP and their family members travelling to the U.S., or if the order would apply retroactively to members of the party already in the country.

How the U.S. would route out all CCP members is also unclear as party membership information is not publically available. The controlling Chinese party is also believed to have around 90 million members. With family members also being considered, the ban could affect hundreds of millions of Chinese nationals.

The White House did not respond to a Wall Street Journal request for comment, however an informal advisor to Trump did speak with The Journal about the proposal.

“It would be an important step in the direction that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been going in the last few months, to delegitimize the Communist Party and its 90 million members,” said Mike Pillsbury, an informal advisor to Trump and director of the Center for Chinese Strategy at the Hudson Institute in Washington.

Pillsbury told The Journal that the visa ban may be an attractive offer as the Chinese government may not be able to impose an effective counter response.

“They may be willing to [enact the visa ban] because the Chinese will not have a counter measure in terms of banning all Republican members from visiting China, which would be absurd.” Pillsbury said.

Jude Blanchette, a China scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, however discouraged the idea of such a visa ban in comments to The New York Times.

“The overwhelming majority of CCP members have no involvement or input into Beijing’s policymaking, so going after the entire party membership is like China sanctioning all Republicans because of frustrations with Trump,” Blanchette said. “Such a move would inflame public opinion in China, as this would target nearly 10 percent of the entire Chinese population and would do so based on blanket assertions of guilt.”

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman also responded to the reported visa ban being considered.

“We hope that the U.S. will stop doing such things that violate and disrespect the basic norms of international relations,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, said at a briefing. “That will not help to safeguard its own image, credibility and status as a great power.”

The proposed visa ban comes amid much efforts by the Trump administration to challenge China on multiple fronts. Trump has criticized China’s handling of the coronavirus, as well as its decision to impose new national security controls over the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong and human rights abuses against ethnic minority group’s like the Uyghurs.

Last week, the U.S. sanctioned a Chinese government agency and four officials connected to Chinese Uyghur internment camps. The sanctions froze any U.S. held assets belonging to the entity and the four officials and banned them and their family members from entry into the U.S.

On Monday the U.S. also rejected Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea, officially challenging Chinese claims to the disputed sea region for the first time."	right
kg6gch	conservative	Poland's justice Minister announces online freedom of speech bill: social media companies will be fined for every post they take down that doesn't break Polish law	"Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro announced a legal initiative on Thursday aimed at enabling internet users to file complaints against the removal of online posts as well as the creation of a special court for freedom of speech.

Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro said the aim of the bill was to give internet users the feeling that their rights are protected and that their posts cannot be arbitrarily removed from online platforms.



The full name of the bill is the law on freedom of expressing one's own views and searching and disseminating information on the internet.



Under its provisions, social media services will not be allowed to remove content or block accounts if the content on them does not break Polish law. In the event of removal or blockage, a complaint can be sent to the platform, which will have 24 hours to consider it. Within 48 hours of the decision, the user will be able to file a petition to the court for the return of access. The court will consider complaints within seven days of receipt and the entire process is to be electronic.



""Often, the victims of tendencies for ideological censorship are also representatives of various groups operating in Poland, whose content is removed or blocked, just because they express views and refer to values that are unacceptable from the point of view of communities... with an ever-stronger influence on the functioning of social media,"" Mr Ziobro said.



""We realise that it is not an easy topic, we realise that on the internet there should also be a sphere of guarantees for everybody who feels slandered, a sphere of limitation of various content which may carry with it a negative impact on the sphere of other people's freedom,"" he said. ""But we would like to propose such tools that will enable both one side and the other to call for the decision of a body that will be able to adjudicate whether content appearing on such and such a social media account really violates personal rights, whether it can be eliminated, or whether there is censorship.""



If a special court rules in favour of the plaintiff and the internet service does not obey the ruling it can subject the internet service to a fine of up to PLN 8 million (EUR 1.8 million) imposed by the Office of Electronic Communications."	right

mkkjrx	conservative	China Is Detaining Christians In Secret Facilities Forcing Them To Renounce Their Faith Or Be Tortured: Report	"The Chinese Communist Party is reportedly detaining Christians in secret facilities and forcing them to renounce their faith or face being tortured for months.

“A member of a Christian ‘house church’ in the southwestern province of Sichuan who asked to be identified by a pseudonym Li Yuese said he was held in a facility run by the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s United Front Work Department, working in tandem with the state security police, for 10 months after a raid on his church in 2018,” Radio Free Asia reported. “Another Christian who asked to remain anonymous told RFA that similar facilities are being used across China, not just for Protestants, but also for members of the underground Catholic church, and of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement, a target of authorities since 1999.”

Radio Free Asia is a non-profit broadcasting corporation funded through the U.S. Agency for Global Media, an independent federal government agency.

The communists reportedly focus mostly on targeting “house churches” that are not members of the CCP-backed Three-Self Patriotic Association, which teaches people a CCP-approved version of Christianity because it views Christianity as a national security threat.

“It was a mobile facility, that could just set up in some basement somewhere. It was staffed by people from several different government departments,” Li said. “It had its own (CCP) political and legal affairs committee working group, and they mainly target Christians who are members of house churches.”

“They use really underhand[ed] methods,” Li continued. “They threaten, insult and intimidate you. These were United Front officials, men, women, sometimes unidentified, usually in plain clothes. The police turn a blind eye to this. You have to accept the statement they prepare for you. If you refuse, you will be seen as having a bad attitude and they will keep you in detention and keep on beating you.”

Li said that the basement that he was kept in was in a secret location where he could not see outside and lost all concept of time. He also said that he tried to hurt himself and thought of suicide often because he said that it would have been better than what he was subjected to.

“I couldn’t sleep; after you’ve been in there a week, death starts to look better than staying there. I bashed myself against the wall to self-harm,” he said. “One time in there, I was groggy and was trying to open my eyes but I couldn’t. Four or five of them grabbed me by the arms and legs and pinned me to the ground. They they injected me with some drug, and brought me back to consciousness.”

Reports on China’s persecution of Christians are hardly new. The Daily Wire highlighted a report last summer about how communist officials in China were reportedly forcing Christians to renounce their faith and remove religious symbols from their homes, replacing them with portraits of Chairman Mao and President Xi Jinping, or face being cut off from all welfare services.

A lawyer in China who said that he had represented a large number of Catholics that had been detained and tortured by communist officials told RFA that after the religious officials were arrested, the communist officials “just disappeared them, sometimes for five, six or even 10 years at a stretch.”

kukm7q	conservative	Marriott, Blue Cross Blue Shield and Commerce Bancshare stop donations to all 147 Republicans who opposed Certifying Biden as President; Ford, Bank of America, CVS, Target, AT&T, Berkshire Hathaway and Exxon Mobil are also considering similar policies	"More big businesses continued a boycott on Sunday of Republican members of Congress who followed Donald Trump's demands and voted to overturn the election.

JPMorgan Chase said that it will pause all contributions from its political action committee for at least the next six months, saying 'the focus of business leaders, political leaders, civic leaders right now should be on governing and getting help to those who desperately need it most right now. There will be plenty of time for campaigning later.'

U.S. digital payments company Stripe is to also stop processing payments for Trump's campaign website following the riot, a company spokesperson said.

Trump was still fundraising after the November 3rd election, apparently to build a legal fund to be used for election challenges, but the money was also to be used for travel and political activities in the future, including a possible 2024 presidential run.

JPMorgan Chase said on Sunday that it will pause all contributions from its political action committee for at least the next six months

Citigroup gave $1,000 to campaign of Republican Senator Josh Hawley who was among those leading the charge against the certification of the Electoral College

Citigroup Inc said in a memo to employees that it had reviewed lawmakers who led the charge against the certification of the Electoral College results and found it gave $1,000 to the campaign of Republican Senator Josh Hawley because the senator represented Missouri where it has 'significant employee presence.'

'We want you to be assured that we will not support candidates who do not respect the rule of law,' wrote Candi Wolff, head of Citi's global government affairs.

'We intend to pause our contributions during the quarter as the country goes through the Presidential transition and hopefully emerges from these events stronger and more united.'

Hotel giant Marriott, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and Commerce Bancshare, the parent company of Commerce Bank and other community banks have all said they too are suspending donations to the group dubbed 'the treason caucus' by critics.

'We have taken the destructive events at the Capitol to undermine a legitimate and fair election into consideration and will be pausing political giving from our Political Action Committee to those who voted against certification of the election,' Marriott spokeswoman Connie Kim said.

Time to go: Demonstrators - including Jon Erblich - called for Josh Hawley to be removed from the Senate at a protest in St. Louis. The Missouri senator does not have a home in the state

A Walmart spokesman said it conducts a review after every election cycle to 'examine and adjust our political giving strategy. As we conduct our review over the coming months we will factor last week's events into our process.'

Ford, AT&T and Bank of America said they would consider lawmakers' actions when deciding on whether to donate, and CVS, Exxon Mobil, FedEx and Target said they are reviewing their political giving.

Berkshire Hathaway said the same. Its owner, Warren Buffett, is the country's most prominent investor and any boycott by his companies would set the tone for other investors.

Political action committees are able to pool employee donations and can give up to $5,000 to a candidate per election, as well as $15,000 annually to any national party committee.

Technology companies including Twitter, Facebook and Amazon have also made moves to limit the spread of disinformation that could incite more violence.

The moves came as the two most prominent Trump loyalists, Texas senator Ted Cruz and Hawley, both faced new demands to quit this weekend.

The Houston Chronicle, Texas' second-largest newspaper, told Cruz in an editorial that it was time to resign, saying: 'You have blood on your hands.'

Message: Demonstrators made clear their anger at Hawley who demanded the election result be overturned

Acolyte: Hawley followed Trump's demands to overturn the election and is now the focus of anger and losing his donors

Existential threat: Kevin McCarthy, the leader of the Republicans in the House (left) went all-in on Trump's fraud claims. He is now losing donors which could loosen his grip on the leadership. Among the other Trump loyalists were Matt Gaetz, who used a speech to claim violent protesters were actually 'antifa,' basing his speech on a facial recognition company being reported to have made the finding. It said he was wrong

And protesters in St. Louis, Missouri, held a public protest Saturday demanding Hawley quit.

It is unlikely he saw it in person; he does not have a home in the state he represents and used his sister's address for his voter registration.

But the donation boycott, first revealed by Popular Information, represents a threat to more than just the controversial senators.

In total eight senators and 139 members of the House voted to overturn the election results in Arizona or Pennsylvania or both - among them Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, and his number two, Steve Scalise.

Both men face an escalating threat to their futures with the number three, Wyoming's Liz Cheney, having vehemently opposed backing Trump, and a series of their caucus speaking up.

The latest was freshman Peter Meijer, of Michigan, who slammed those who voted to overturn the election on Saturday as cowards, liars and grifters.

And Adam Kinzinger, an outspoken anti-Trump voice, revealed a threat by a Trump loyalist radio host, David Webb, to force a primary against him for speaking out, tweeting: 'I know one thing I'm at peace with... I didn't cause an insurrection that killed 5 including a heroic Capitol Police officer beaten by a 'patriot' with a fire extinguisher.'

Marriott's move is the first sign that big business will cut off the cash spigot to those who voted to overturn the election.

In a statement it said: 'We have taken the destructive events at the Capitol to undermine a legitimate and fair election into consideration and will be pausing political giving from our Political Action Committee to those who voted against certification of the election.'

It had donated $1,000 directly to Hawley and $1,000 to his political action committee, and its political action committee donated almost $200,000 to Republicans in the 2020 election cycle.

The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association said in its statement: 'In light of this week's violent, shocking assault on the United States Capitol, and the votes of some members of Congress to subvert the results of November's election by challenging Electoral College results, BCBSA will suspend contributions to those lawmakers who voted to undermine our democracy.'

It had donated $500 to Hawley, but $10,000 to Tommy Tuberville, the new Alabama senator who voted to overturn the results even after other Republicans deserted the measure in the wake of the violence.

The former football coach is a political novice who thought his WWII veteran father helped liberate Paris from 'Communists' and said he would need six months to learn the rules of the Senate.

Another demand to go: Ted Cruz was told to resign by the Houston Chronicle as bog donors started deserting and more could follow. Among those reviewing donations in future are AT&T which is headquartered in Dallas

Pariahs: Joe Manchin, the moderate Democratic senator from West Virginia, said of Hawley and Cruz: 'I don't know how they live with themselves.'

All in this together: Matt Gaetz was one of the most recognizable House members of the 'treason caucus' and elbow-bumped Hawley during the joint session to ratify Joe Biden's victory

Trump phoned Tuberville when senators were being held in a secure area as the MAGA mob ran free to ask him to object to even more states' results when the Senate resumed election certification.

And Commerce Banschare told Popular Information: 'At this time, we have suspended all support for officials who have impeded the peaceful transfer of power.'

Its Commerce Bank is headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri, and has branches in the mid-west, Kansas, and Colorado.

It donated $5,000 to Roger Marshall, the new Kansas senator who voted to decertify both Arizona and Pennsylvania, and overall donated six times as much to Republicans as Democrats out of $113,000 in total donations.

Company PACs, which all three operate, are powerful tools because the companies' own executives and employees are likely to follow their example in how to donate to.

The Blue Cross Blue Shield's associations individual state members also look to the national association for political direction.

And candidates rely on corporate donations to be the backbone of the their operations.

They are much less costly to gather and process than those from individual voters and few politicians are successful at harvesting national small-dollar donations.

Among the two who were successful were Cruz and Hawley, who made text message appeals to their supporters for cash while the mob rampaged.

Three big-name companies deserting, and more reviewing could open the way for others to follow.

The biggest companies are represented by the Business Round Table, which is chaired by WalMart's Doug McMillon.

It has still to spell out a position on donations but slammed Trump's 'fiction' as being the reason for the MAGA riots.

On Friday it issued a statement which said: 'Yesterday's inexcusable violence and chaos at the Capitol makes clear that elected officials' perpetuation of the fiction of a fraudulent 2020 presidential election is not only reprehensible, but also a danger to our democracy, our society and our economy.'

Hawley is so far the biggest financial loser out of the Republicans, with two of his mega-donors slamming him.

David Humphreys, a CEO whose family have donated $6 million to Hawley, said the senator should be censured, and Sam Fox, another Missouri donor, said he would never give to Hawley.

He also lost his book deal with Simon & Schuster for a work on big tech censorship and responded saying he would sue the private company for breaching his First Amendment rights.

Inside the senate the two are now pariahs for Democrats and Republicans are barely more friendly.

Joe Manchin, the moderate Democrat from West Virginia, told CNN's State of the Union Sunday that he did not think the Senate had power to expel them but that they should be 'beaten by the American people' if they try to run for re-election.

'I don't know how they can live with themselves,' he said.

Chris Coons, a moderate Democrat who is both close to Joe Biden and known for his friendships across the aisle, however has called for an expulsion vote, saying that by voting to overturn the election results they had lost the right to serve.

Pat Toomey, the Republican from Pennsylvania, said the two 'would have a lot of soul searching' for their actions.

He told NBC's Meet the Press: 'That's going to haunt them for a very long time. They're going to pay a very heavy price.'

Senators - and congressmen - are not subject to recall elections and can only be expelled by two-thirds majority votes in their chambers.

In the House there is little danger of an expulsion vote given that 139 Republicans voted to overturn the vote.

But an escalating big business boycott would cripple McCarthy and Scalise's hold over their caucus.

It could also spread to a boycott of the Republican National Committee which voted after the violence to reinstate Ronna McDaniel as its chair.

She had been all-in on overturning the election, leading to questions over whether corporate donors could boycott her efforts too."	right
lawiuz	conservative	Jeff Bezos Loved Mail-In Voting For The 2020 Election, But Not For Amazon Unionization Efforts	"Bezos's opinion on vote-by-mail isn't about security, but political and personal expedience, as is proven by the many WaPo articles showing contradictions between the 2020 election and Amazon unionization.

Between his two major companies, Amazon and the Washington Post, Jeff Bezos does not hold consistent views on mail-in voting. When it could assist his preferred presidential candidate in reaching the White House, it was safe, and any questions to the contrary were mere attempts to undermine democracy. Yet now that his own employees at Amazon wish to use those same methods to vote for unionization, suddenly this wonderful format is not secure enough.

Amazon workers are voting to form a union to combat the shipping and tech giant’s notoriously poor working conditions, much to the company’s chagrin. Amazon has actively tried to prevent unions from gaining a foothold, creating a website detailing the benefits the company already provides and attempting to postpone the vote.

Employees at a fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama — which recently became the state with the highest COVID-19 positivity rate — out of fear of catching or spreading coronavirus, intended to have their election by mail. After all, for the past six months, the corporate press inundated readers and viewers with decrees that in contrast to deadly in-person voting during the pandemic, vote-by-mail was a perfectly safe alternative.

Amazon petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to postpone Bessemer’s election in order to prevent voting by mail. An exclusively in-person union vote could easily harm voter turn out, which could work to Amazon’s favor, and the corporate giant knows this. Its petition claims that the group of 5,800 employees is prohibitively large to organize voting by mail, an election format that has “serious and systemic flaws.” Amazon likewise told CNN that “the best approach to a valid, fair and successful election is one that is conducted manually, in-person.”

Bezos clearly does not want his employees to unionize. When you’re the wealthiest person in the world but treat your employees horribly, why would you possibly desire to provide them a recourse to demand changes you could easily afford to improve working conditions?

The Washington Post spent the last election cycle explaining why demands for in-person voting, the stance Amazon is now taking, is everything from “nonsense” to “racist.” Bezos himself celebrated the 2020 election, which heavily relied on voting by mail, posting on instagram, “By voting in record numbers, the American people proved again that our democracy is strong.”

If there were any ideological consistency on the left regarding election safety and security, neither Bezos nor his newspaper would approve of his treatment of Amazon employees. But their opinion on elections has nothing to do with actual security, but rather political and personal expedience, as is proven by the many articles that demonstrate the blatant contradictions.

‘Nearly Tamper-Proof’ Vote-by-Mail This article from July 2020 detailed Oregon’s vote-by-mail strategy in an effort to rebuke any concerns leveled by President Donald Trump and other Republicans. It explained how “convenient” and “nearly tamper-proof” the system was, as well as being safe during lockdowns. The open claim that mail-in ballots “work great” is a far cry from the new claim of “serious and systemic flaws.”

All the Voter Suppression

The very next day, the Washington Post published another piece that vehemently stood against any questions around mail-in ballots. Apparently, concerns that vote-by-mail systems could lead to increased fraud was a “racist” “dog whistle,” akin to support of the Confederacy or the KKK. The story mostly detailed historic examples of racially-motivated voter suppression, ascribing similar motives to conservatives. It’s interesting yet unsurprising that Amazon isn’t marked with the same accusations now."	right
l1xtsf	conservative	Marjorie Taylor Greene warns GOP the base is loyal to Trump — not the party	"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene warned fellow Republicans Wednesday the base of the party is “no longer loyal to the GOP.”

“Their loyalty now lies with Donald J Trump,” the Georgia Republican said on Twitter shortly after Mr. Trump left the White House for a final time as the nation’s 45th president.

Mr. Trump is not attending President-elect Joseph R. Biden’s swearing-in ceremony, breaking with recent tradition amid reports he’s considering starting a new political party.

GOP leaders, meanwhile, have said Mr. Trump bears some responsibility for the recent storming of the U.S. Capitol after feeding lies to his supporters that the election was stolen.

Ms. Greene, who has expressed support for QAnon conspiracy theories, has been a steadfast Trump supporter.

She backed his claims of widespread voter fraud — even after they flamed out in courts, and in her home state of Georgia, where Mr. Trump slammed GOP leaders for not backing his allegations.

Ms. Greene said Wednesday that numerous people have told her they will never vote, donate or volunteer for the party.

“They feel sold out by R’s who didn’t fight harder against the radical socialist agenda that Biden & Dems are bringing in,” Ms. Greene said. “It does not matter if we are in the minority.

“It does not matter if Dems have control,” she said. “All that matters is that every Republican fight for America First at all cost!”

ju092t	conservative	California Gov Newsom busted attending large dinner party against his own advice	"Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom has admitted it was probably not the best idea for him and his wife to join a large dinner party at one of the world's finest restaurants while he is discouraging the citizens of his state from gathering with folks outside their own households during the upcoming holiday season.

What are the details?

The San Francisco Chronicle first reported that Newsom and his wife, first partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom, attended a recent dinner with a dozen people, involving ""more households than California advises,"" at the French Laundry — known as one of the most exclusive restaurants in the world.

Politico reported that the celebration was for ""the 50th birthday of lobbyist Jason Kinney, a longtime friend.""

The Hill pointed out that ""California's current coronavirus guidelines prohibit gatherings that include more than three households,"" according to the Chronicle. ""Gatherings must also be held outside and should last no longer than two hours.""

But after the news broke, critics cried foul, claiming hypocrisy and pointing to Newsom warning against Californians getting together in large numbers. One of the governor's aides, Nathan Click, came to his defense, saying that Newsom and his wife ""followed public health guidelines and the restaurant's protocols — all in line with the state's rules for restaurant operation.""

Click added that restaurants in the state are only required to ""limit the number of patrons at a single table to a household unit or patrons who have asked to be seated together.""

Newsom himself also reached out to the Chronicle, conceding, ""While our family followed the restaurant's health protocols and took safety precautions, we should have modeled better behavior and not joined the dinner.""

Anything else?

Newsom was not the first California politician to get busted flouting his own coronavirus recommendations on Friday.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) took heat from across the political spectrum after defending her decision to allow the lower chamber to continue holding banquets for newly elected members while Americans are being discouraged from holding large family gatherings for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday.

Meals were reportedly packed up for attendees to take home at the Democratic caucus' celebration following public outrage.

Pelosi was lambasted a few months ago after she was caught maskless visiting a shuttered San Francisco salon that the city had forced to close for months as part of the municipality's stringent COVID-19 regulations."	right
m8bc8o	conservative	Vegan cafe that charged 18% ‘man tax’ goes out of business.	"A lesbian-owned, vegan restaurant that charged an 18% “man tax” has closed its doors after less than two years of business in Brunswick, Australia.

Handsome Her, a small restaurant billed as “a space by women, for women,” made international headlines in 2017 after announcing upon its opening that female customers would get priority seating and men would be charged an optional 18% tax “to reflect the gender pay gap.”

Less than two years later, the cafe’s owners announced that they would be closing up shop in order to continue their mission with more “hands-on work.”

“When we opened Handsome Her in 2017, we expected that perhaps we might make a stir through our brazen public discussions of structural inequality and oppression,” the cafe said in a Facebook post. “The man tax blew up the internet, an idea that we didn’t think was all too radical, yet the way the world responded showed us how fragile masculinity is and solidified the necessity for us to confront and dismantle patriarchy.

“While it is a shame to lose the physical space (and we understand how essential it is for women and lesbians to hold space), we leave knowing that the communities we have made transcend the trendy vegan café on Sydney Rd, Brunswick,” the cafe said. “We look forward to continuing Handsome Her in a variety of other, more creative ways and expanding our efforts to drive change with flexibility and mobility throughout Australia.”

While the cafe’s last day of business was on April 14, the owners are holding a farewell party with “story-telling, dancing, singing, eating and drinking” on Sunday.

Brave whistleblowers exposing lies & illegal actions in our government must be protected.



Join me and urge Congress: Pass my bipartisan legislation (HRes1162, HRes1175, HR8452) calling for charges against @snowden & Assange to be dropped & to reform the Espionage Act.#PassItOn pic.twitter.com/x4Oieu1YgH — Tulsi Gabbard 🌺 (@TulsiGabbard) October 6, 2020

Tulsi Gabbard Bipartisan Support?

The resolution introduced claims the prosecution against Assange is a hit to America’s constitutional right of freedom of the press, “newsgathering activities and news organizations ability to acquire and publish information are protected under the First Amendment.”

Edward Snowden has been unfairly villainized and persecuted for disclosing the true scope of illegal government surveillance. This is unjust, charges against Snowden should be dropped., Florida Congressman (R)Matt Gaetz giving his bipartisan support to drop charges against Edward Snowden

Gabbard has received support from the other side of the aisle from Republican congressmen Matt Gaetz of Florida and Thom Massie of Kentucky who have advocated that the government drop their extradition case to prosecute Julian Assange and Edward Snowden as it will create a slippery slope.

A government targeting people for what they don’t want exposed to the masses is dictator like and inhumane, when it’s the government who committed crimes not the men who brought the governments crimes to light.

The ongoing attempts to prosecute Julian Assange threaten our First Amendment rights, and should be opposed by all who wish to safeguard our constitutional rights now and in the years to come, I join my colleague, Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, in calling for an immediate end to all charges against Mr. Assange. Kentucky Congressman (R) Thomas Massie giving bipartisan support for dropping charges against Julian Assange

There has been zero support from congresswoman AOC who has primarily focused on the green new deal and climate change overall, I guess that’s what happens when the left refuse to speak about the U.S. military industrial complex.

The decision to extradite Assange will come after the election the judge has said."	right

U.S.—A recent report from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) revealed a huge spike in mental wellbeing among one segment of the American population—the tens of thousands of conservatives who were kicked off of Twitter last week. The report showed increases as high as 300% for those who are no longer engaging on the Orwellian social media platform.

“For years we knew Twitter wasn’t great for mental health, but we didn’t think it was this bad,” said NIMH Director Dr. Joshua Gordon. “Some of these people are showing levels of good mental health that we’ve never even seen before.”

Users whose accounts were shut down only took a few days to experience the benefits of their newfound freedom.

“At first I was upset,” said Chet Bradman, one of many right-leaning Americans de-platformed by Twitter. “But after a few days, I realized how much better my life was. The sun was brighter, the birds’ songs were more beautiful. I just wish Twitter would have overstepped its reach and shown its true colors on free speech years ago.”

While the NIMH report is available to the public, Twitter, Google, and Facebook are doing their best to suppress the information in an attempt to keep users under their control and keep Americans in a toxic state of mental health.

ksjmgb	conservative	A QAnon promoter stormed the Capitol. Now, he's upset people are saying he's 'antifa'	"Update: On Saturday, the man was arrested in Arizona and has been charged with violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.

---

A well-known QAnon promoter has learned first-hand what it feels like to be accused of being someone you are not.

Because of his flashy costume, the so-called Q Shaman has become a photogenic fixture of QAnon rallies — and he found himself an even bigger platform on Jan. 6 when images of him breaking into the U.S. Capitol were seen all over the world. Shirtless, face painted and sporting a furry hat, he is unmistakable.

Except, it appears, to the conspiracy theory ecosystem he is part of.

The Q Shaman is an Arizona man named Jake Angeli, who has been vocally and publicly in favor of President Donald Trump and a slew of far-right conspiracy theories for years. He's also, as his name indicates, a big QAnon believer. QAnon adherents believe a secret military operation is currently in play to take down the satanic, occasionally cannibalistic, group of pedophiles who make up the global elite. Although QAnon welcomes and incorporates almost any old-school conspiracy theory you can think of — anti-Semitic tropes, JFK conspiracy, anti-vax pseudoscience, etc. — its unifier is Trump, who believers insist is integral to taking down the deep state.

Angeli has sported his distinctive look in Arizona since at least 2019, when he hit the media's radar for appearing at pro-Trump and QAnon rallies. From the Arizona Republic:

""Angeli, in a 2020 interview with The Arizona Republic, said that he wears the fur bonnet, paints his face and walks around shirtless with ragged pants as a way to attract attention. Then, he said, he is able to speak to people about his beliefs about QAnon and other truths he says remain hidden.""

Win McNamee/TNS

Despite his well-documented history as a Trump supporter, on Wednesday night the right-wing media ecosystem turned on him. Lin Wood, the lawyer behind several failed suits to overrun the presidential election, tweeted a photo of Angeli and others who broke into the Capitol with the caption, ""Indisputable photographic evidence that antifa violently broke into Congress today."" The tweet is no longer available as Wood's Twitter account was banned.

The talking point was also picked up by Pastor Mark Burns, another big name on the pro-Trump social media circuit. ""This is NOT a Trump supporter...This is a staged #Antifa attack,"" he tweeted with a photo of Angeli posing on the Senate dais.

Angeli himself responded to the Wood tweet, trying to clarify that he is, in fact, pro-Trump.

""Mr. Wood. I am not antifa or blm,"" he wrote. ""I'm a Qanon & digital soldier. My name is Jake & I marched with the police & fought against BLM & ANTIFA in PHX. Look up OAN's coverage of July 4ths rally in PHX capital. I was standing against the BLM mob out numbered but unphased. Look it up...""

Tony Thai/Hearst Connecticut Media

Conspiracy theories about antifa, which is an ideology that opposes fascism not an organized group, have quickly gone mainstream on the right. By Wednesday evening, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., was already on the floor of Congress repeating it.

""Some of the people who breached the Capitol today were not Trump supporters,"" he said. ""They were masquerading as Trump supporters and in fact, were members of the violent terrorist group antifa.""

There is no evidence ""antifa"" infiltrators were part of the mob that broke into the Capitol. Accusing left-aligned groups of terrorism is a well-trod path for conspiracy theorists, who point to fictional ""false flags"" meant to discredit conservatives. The deflection is proactive as well as reactive; InfoWars host Alex Jones regularly warns his listeners that staged terrorist attacks are constantly on the horizon, planned by their enemies to pin on ""patriots.""

The unsubstantiated antifa claim was amplified last night by Fox News hosts Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, and on Thursday morning, Rep. Mo Brooks, an Alabama Republican, was tweeting it, too.

""Please, don’t be like #FakeNewsMedia, don’t rush to judgment on assault on Capitol. Wait for investigation,"" he wrote. ""All may not be (and likely is not) what appears. Evidence growing that fascist ANTIFA orchestrated Capitol attack with clever mob control tactics.""

In fact, there are thousands of videos and photos, many taken by the Trump supporters themselves, showing proud Trump fans wandering the building. Other well-known far-right personalities, like infamous alt-right troll Baked Alaska, were actually livestreamed from inside Senate offices."	right

ks9gfa	conservative	Biden’s Electoral College victory certified -- hours after Capitol chaos	"The U.S. Congress early Thursday certified the Electoral College vote that gave Democrat Joe Biden his presidential victory -- after a day in Washington that was marred by pro-Trump protesters storming the U.S. Capitol.

Vice President Mike Pence, who had announced he would not overturn the will of voters, confirmed the Biden victory at 3:41 a.m. ET.

Lawmakers had returned to the chamber in an act of defiance, with some Republicans who initially vowed to challenge states’ results due to voter fraud concerns announcing they'd instead vote to certify.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called the breach of the Capitol a ""failed insurrection."" He said those who ""tried to disrupt our democracy"" had not succeeded.

""The United States and the Senate will not be intimidated,"" he tweeted. ""We are back at our posts. We will discharge our duty under the Constitution for our nation. And we are going to do it tonight.""

McConnell announced earlier that once the Senate voted 92-7 to reject the Republican effort to overturn Pennsylvania's vote, the path would be clear for Biden to claim the White House on Jan. 20.

Despite growing support among Republicans to challenge the election result, the effort to overturn the election was always seen to have little chance to succeed.

PELOSI'S OFFICE STORMED DURING CHAOS

Dan Scavino, the White House deputy chief of staff, posted a statement from President Trump on Twitter that seemed to call for calm among Americans and demonstrate a functioning government for adversaries.

""Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th,"" the statement read. ""I have always said we would continue our fight to ensure that only legal votes were counted. While this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it’s only the beginning of our fight to Make America Great Again!""

The political fallout from Wednesday's mayhem seemed to cast serious doubt on Trump's future as leader of the Republican Party. Sen Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, addressed the Senate, saying Trump has been a ""consequential"" president over four years in office ""but today ... count me out. Enough is enough.""

Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who is projected to lose her runoff in Georgia against the Rev. Raphael Warnock, was among the senators who changed their minds about challenging Biden's win.

""When I arrived in Washington this morning, I fully intended to object to the certification of the electoral votes,"" Loeffler, R-Ga., said in remarks from the Senate floor. ""However, the events that have transpired today have forced me to reconsider and I cannot now, in good conscience, object.""

Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., also announced she would vote to certify the results.

There seemed to be a sense of melancholy among lawmakers later into the night. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., told reporters it was probably one of the saddest days he had experienced as an elected official.

""What normally would have been a tradition in the step towards the peaceful transition of power from one administration to another was marred by violence, thugs, misinformation and clearly should never have happened in the first place,"" he said.

COTTON CALLS ON TRUMP TO 'QUIT MISLEADING' SUPPORTERS

Detractors of the president criticized him for stoking anger among his supporters and said a violent incident was inevitable. They say the president has been pushing the false narrative about election interference for the past month and his presidency was bound to end in chaos.

Twitter, Facebook and Instagram temporarily suspended the president from posting on to their platforms. The Associated Press reported that it was the most aggressive action social media companies had yet taken against the president.

JONATHAN TURLEY: TRUMP'S LEGACY 'IN TATTERS' AFTER SUPPORTERS RIOT AT CAPITOL

Trump's supporters noted the president had called for calm. They say Trump never had his day in court and there were enough voting irregularities to warrant further inspection. They also criticized the media coverage of the unrest at the Capitol and criticized news outlets for essentially turning a blind eye to the violence that broke out in major cities last summer.

Donald Trump Jr. also called for calm in an earlier tweet.

""This is wrong and not who we are,"" he wrote. ""Be peaceful and use your 1st Amendment rights, but don’t start acting like the other side. We have a country to save and this doesn’t help anyone.""

Washington D.C. police said at a news conference late Wednesday that there were four deaths—including a woman who was fatally shot -- and at least 52 arrests during the day's disruption.

Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat who has clashed with Trump, ordered an extension of the public emergency that was already in place for the next 15 days, which will overlap with Biden’s inauguration.

The woman who was shot was Ashli Babbitt, a U.S. Air Force veteran from San Diego, Calif., a friend told Fox News. D.C. police confirmed she had been shot by one of their officers.

The other three deaths were medical-related, reports said.

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told Fox News last Sunday that the Supreme Court was a ""better forum"" than Congress for vetting election concerns but the court did not take the cases.

Cruz wanted a 10-day audit of the results by an electoral commission.

""Voter fraud has posed a persistent challenge in our elections, although its breadth and scope are disputed,"" lawmakers said Saturday in a statement. Cruz said the allegations of fraud in the 2020 election exceeded any in our lifetimes.

The senator condemned those who stormed the Capitol. He posted on Twitter that the Constitution ""protects peaceful protest, but violence — from Left or Right – is ALWAYS wrong.""

He issued a statement that called the incident a ""despicable act of terrorism and a shocking assault on our democratic system.""

Cruz said his intention was to give millions of Americans confidence in the election and was disappointed in the outcome in Congress. But he said he respected their positions on the issue.

""Debate in the two houses of Congress is the proper way to resolve our political differences, not through violent attacks,"" he said.

WASHINGTON, D.C.—In a genius move, Trump has stopped Kamala Harris from becoming the first female president by identifying as a female himself.

""I am now a WOMAN,"" Trump announced to reporters in the White House press room. ""My name is now Donna Trump and I am the first female president. I'm a very pretty lady-president. I win!""

Liberals are outraged that Donna Trump has outsmarted them by stealing this historic moment away from Kamala Harris. They responded by shouting and snarling and throwing their notebooks, enraged that Trump had owned them one last time.

""I -- I just can't,"" said Rachel Maddow on her show that evening. ""It doesn't matter how ravishingly beautiful the new Donna Trump is. I know she's attractive. But I feel like Trump is just messing with us at this point. Plus, I'm now confused about throwing America's first transgender president out of office!""

Feminists are also furious since they can no longer criticize Donna Trump for being loud, abrasive, bossy, and brash.

Unfortunately, liberals got the last laugh since, after Trump's announcement, his pay was immediately cut 30 percent."	right
kz6i6c	conservative	Trump slashed aid to China by 52 percent - The Spectator	"President Trump cut foreign aid to China in half in just one year, according to an Office of Management and Budget report obtained exclusively by The Spectator.

The report, which provides a full accounting of US spending on China and is the first of its kind, revealed several key trends that are sure to thrill China hawks. Direct aid to China fell from $62 million in Fiscal Year 2019 to $30 million in Fiscal Year 2020, a decrease of 52 percent. Spending on strategic competition with China jumped from $42.4 billion to $47.5 billion, a 12 percent increase. The US also imposed $60 billion worth of duties on imported Chinese goods.

Multiple China support programs saw major reductions in spending or were ceased entirely under the Trump administration. For example, in 2019, the Export-Import Bank provided $11 million in financing guarantees for Chinese transactions. In 2020, it provided none. The US Trade and Development Agency ended its operations in China, cutting $2 million worth of investments in Chinese infrastructure projects. The US also ended its Peace Corps program in China for good following the pandemic.

At the same time, the US increased spending on programs it deemed to be effective in curbing China’s global ascendency. In 2020, Congress appropriated $300 million for the brand new Countering Chinese Influence Fund, which the OMB says is used for ‘cybersecurity, government transparency, foreign military financing, efforts to counter Chinese propaganda, and many other strategically important activities.’

This budget crosscut was originally proposed by noted China hawk Michael Pillsbury in his book The Hundred Year Marathon. Bloomberg reported in September that the OMB had asked federal agencies to submit details of their China funding for this report.

OMB China Crosscut by Amber Athey

‘This is the first time that OMB has conducted a government-wide accounting of US spending in China and US spending that supports strategic competition with China,’ OMB director Russ Vought said in a letter to Sen. Rick Scott announcing the completion of the report. ‘I believe it’s especially important that we prevent US taxpayer funding from supporting our strategic adversaries.’

Trump’s aggressive actions against China in an attempt to counter the regime’s growing global economic influence and hold it accountable for a litany of misdeeds is one of the biggest foreign-policy shifts in decades. In contrast, past administrations normalized trade relations with the CCP and allowed it to play-act as a liberal regime in global institutions in the misguided hopes that a beneficial economic alliance would encourage China toward good behavior.

On Tuesday, Trump signed an executive order banning transactions with several Chinese apps. Previously, he pulled the US out of the World Health Organization after it helped cover up China’s mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic, implemented heavy tariffs on Chinese goods, sanctioned Chinese officials responsible for abuses in Hong Kong and purged pro-CCP education programs from American universities. The administration’s efforts highlighted in the OMB report to cut or divert taxpayers funds from aid to China are merely the latest, perhaps the last example of Trump’s determination to maintain his tough stance against China."	right
l3cjp6	conservative	Mitch McConnell Needs To Go	"The Senate Minority Leader no longer represents conservative voters.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has done very good service for the American people. His Merrick Garland gambit was one of the riskiest and best political plays in congressional history. He has seated an enormous amount of conservative judges. He deserves our thanks for that.

But he also has to sit down now and let the conservative movement grow into its new form — a form he seems completely opposed to.

McConnell is playing a ridiculous game of footsie with the idea of convicting Donald Trump in his absurd impeachment. It’s a bridge too far and an obvious power play, and he lacks the power to pull it off.

American conservatives know that after Democrats all but cheered on violence and rioting for months, the idea that Trump incited an insurrection is pure nonsense. It’s a lie and McConnell’s parroting of it is disqualifying for leadership.

So why is McConnell playing along with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s charade of impeachment? He thinks he can get the conservative movement back on his and the Chamber of Commerce’s team.

He can’t. If he pushes this impeachment conviction, as he seems to be, he should have no place in Republican leadership. It is nothing short of a betrayal of Republican voters.

I don’t know who McConnell thinks he is appealing to here. It is obvious that conservative voters have not abandoned Trump, even if he has. He seems to think that we will just go back to the pro-war, pro-corporate party he came up in. We won’t. That party was destroyed by Trump and good riddance.

And why did Cocaine Mitch get the opportunity to fill all these judgeships? Why did his Garland gambit pay off? Only because of Trump. Maybe he forgot but Mitt Romney, his buddy in dragging Trump, lost his bid for the presidency in 2012. But luckily for conservatives, Trump won. And yeah, we have a lot of judges to show for it — because of Trump.

McConnell has power, but he has no constituency. Nobody is lining up to watch him make a speech. Nobody is buying Mitch McConnell merch. That may seem petty, but it isn’t. McConnell represents a Republican Party willing to lose everything as long as big business does well. That’s over. Republican voters won’t have it anymore. They know we are in a culture war that he has no interest in fighting. We need Republican leaders who will.

Josh Hawley, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Tom Cotton will fight this fight. These are the leaders we need. McConnell’s GOP was destroyed by Trump, but McConnell still doesn’t know it. He’d rather throw in with those who prefer losing to fighting. No. We aren’t going back to McConnell’s losing coalition. Trump lost, but he brought a new group of people to the GOP.

That is the most important thing. A new working-class, diverse party is the future, not McConnell’s white guys at the Rotary Club. They are welcome to be a part of this new coalition, but if they try to kneecap it, as McConnell is, they can let the door hit them on the way out. Go be a Joe Biden Democrat.

Trump won an election and allowed McConnell to achieve his goals. Now Mitch wants to throw Trump under the bus. We see it. We won’t stand for it. There are better leaders for us in the Senate. Let’s have one. McConnell is so out of touch that a campfire couldn’t burn his fingers. They are insulated by his corporate connections. Let’s be done with that.

Its time for us to take up Trump’s call for a populist conservatism. We have the people, if not the media. But the media follows the people, not the other way around. It is time for new leadership. It is time for Republicans to select a new Senate leader, thank McConnell for his service, and show him the door."	right

Google has suspended the app from Google Play.

In a statement given to Politico, Google says that they have a longstanding policy in place that requires apps that have user-generated content to have a moderation policy and enforcement that removes anything egregious, like a post that could incite violence. Since Parler doesn’t have a moderation policy, and Google has apparently reminded them of that in recent months, with “continued posting in the Parler app that seeks to incite ongoing violence in the U.S.,” they have decided to suspend the app.

For those curious, Buzzfeed reports Apple has already given Parler a notice of 24 hours to comply with a similar rule to what Google just laid out. You have to wonder if they’ll give them that long, now that Donald Trump has been suspended by Twitter and could move over to Parler, where many of his supporters have already setup shop.

j3v8nv	conservative	Biden responds to Trumps' positive coronavirus tests: 'Jill and I send our thoughts... for a swift recovery'	"Joe Biden on Friday morning tweeted he and his wife, Jill, are sending their thoughts to President Trump and first lady Melania Trump and wishing ""for a swift recovery"" after the Trumps announced they'd tested positive for COVID-19.

The Associated Press reported that Biden has been tested for coronavirus, and is awaiting results. The Biden campaign told Fox News that Biden's running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, was tested Thursday, as part of the campaign's routine testing, and tested negative.

The Democratic presidential nominee in a tweet Friday said, ""We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family.""

Biden and Trump shared the same stage on Tuesday night in Cleveland, Ohio, as they debated for the first time in the presidential election. Debate moderator and 'Fox News Sunday' host Chris Wallace said Friday that the two candidates were standing approximately eight feet apart.

In August, the Biden campaign said that the former vice president and Harris would be tested regularly for COVID-19 and that the campaign would make results public if either candidate tested positive.

Biden was scheduled to campaign Friday in Michigan. There's no word yet if his schedule was being altered.

While the president has been holding large rallies with many of his supporters not wearing masks or socially distanced from each other, Biden's been holding small scale in-person events, with people attending wearing masks and socially distanced.

Harris took to Twitter Friday morning to say that she and her husband Doug Emhoff ""join Joe Biden and Dr. Biden in wishing President Trump and the First Lady a full and speedy recovery. We're keeping them and the entire Trump family in our thoughts.""

Harris is scheduled to face off with Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday, Oct. 7, at a vice presidential debate in Salt Lake City, Utah.

lin9t1	conservative	Disney Fired Gina Carano Over A Nazi Comparison But Has No Problem With Chinese Concentration Camps -- According to Disney, making Holocaust analogies on social media is a fireable offense, but profiting off an ongoing modern-day genocide is A-OK.	"According to the Walt Disney Company, making Holocaust analogies on social media is a fireable offense, but profiting off an ongoing modern-day genocide is A-OK. Disney-owned Lucasfilm fired “The Mandalorian” actress Gina Carano this week for posting a Nazi comparison on her Instagram.

“Jews were beaten in the streets, not by Nazi soldiers but by their neighbors … even by children,” Carano wrote. “Most people today don’t realize that to get to the point where Nazi soldiers could easily round up thousands of Jews, the government first made their own neighbors hate them simply for being Jews. How is that any different from hating someone for their political views.”

Lucasfilm told Variety Magazine that “her social media posts denigrating people based on their cultural and religious identities are abhorrent and unacceptable.” Yet the actual ongoing rounding up of people based on cultural and religious identities, not just words about it, has yet to be denounced by Lucasfilm’s parent organization.

The Disney company has remained silent when called out for filming its live-action “Mulan” movie in the same region that the Chinese Communist government is holding at least 1 million Uighurs, members of ethnic minorities, in concentration camps, according to the U.S. State Department. Disney even went as far as thanking the CCP and their propaganda departments in the credits of the film.

The Chinese agencies given a special shout-out from Disney are the very same bureaucracies telling the international press and the family members of enslaved Uighurs that they are merely being held in “training centers.” Multiple reports and Uighur activists have alleged that what actually happens in these “training centers” is not just indoctrination but detention, mass surveillance, forced sterilization, and even systemic rape, according to the BBC.

One woman interviewed by the BBC who was detained for 18 months in Xinjiang, the same region where several scenes in “Mulan” were filmed, described how she was forced to strip Uighur women naked and handcuff them.

“My job was to remove their clothes above the waist and handcuff them so they cannot move,” said Gulzira Auelkhan. “Then I would leave the women in the room and a man would enter — some Chinese man from outside or policeman. I sat silently next to the door, and when the man left the room I took the woman for a shower.”

This is just one example of numerous horrific reports to come out of the Xinjiang region. Other recent stories include U.S. Customs and Border Protection seizing 13 tons of beauty products made from prisoners’ hair and Uighur men blindfolded and handcuffed awaiting transport at a train station.

Apparently, these types of human rights violations are not a problem for Disney. There is too much money to be made in Chinese markets to offend the CCP. But should an outspoken conservative actress liken political speech censorship to what happened in Nazi Germany, well, that is where they draw the line."	right

""As bad as last week was ... let's not confuse 5,000 people with 74 million,"" Maher began his monologue. ""Yes, even supporting the insurrection in spirit is, well, deplorable. But there's a difference between holding illiberal beliefs and acting violently on them. At least that's what they always told me about Islamic terrorism.""

""I've preached, and still do, that you can hate Trump, but not all the people who like him,"" Maher said. ""And as counterintuitive as it may seem, you can like something run by a------s without being one yourself.""

kn7g9y	conservative	Greedy Health Care Providers Must Disclose Prices In 2021 Thanks To Trump’s Executive Order	"Starting in January 2021, hospitals will be required to disclose their pricing negotiations to better inform consumers.

The new rule, which mandates that health care systems and insurance companies reveal costs for tests, procedures, and treatments, follows a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to uphold President Donald Trump’s executive order calling for health care price transparency.

While the American Hospital Association and others attempted to challenge the 2019 order, claiming it would be expensive, reduce competition, and potentially redirect certain resources, the judges sided with the administration, citing the benefits for consumers and potential for lower costs.

Under the current system, hospitals and insurance companies privately negotiate the pricing for certain procedures and treatments, allowing for an increase in health care prices with little-to-no accountability.

Many of these are the same hospitals who, despite collecting millions from the taxpayer-funded Federal Emergency Management Agency COVID-19 disaster aid, are still sitting on potentially billions of dollars in “cash reserves and investments” just waiting to be used. Studies indicate that 25 percent of this total health care spending is waste in the form of billions of dollars.

Now with more publicly available information, consumers, journalists, and others can make health care providers and insurers answer to rising costs, a move that longtime patient-rights advocate Cynthia Fisher says turns the power of choice over to patients, with the hopes of creating more affordable care.

“The courts have spoken in favor of pro-consumer and pro-competition in health care, and it’s going to be a huge shift because we have not been able to know prices,” Fisher said, noting it is a largely nonpartisan issue. “We’ve been blind, we’ve been blindfolded, and we’ve been blindsided by bills that don’t match our experiences and are many times overcharged.”

“This actually shifts the power between the hospitals and the insurance companies, and all the middle players that have been capitalizing on our American patients’ misfortune,” she continued. “Now for the first time, patients will be in charge of their health decisions and will be able to shop.”

The system revamp designed to create accountability will officially be enforced beginning Jan. 1, 2021, for hospitals and in 2022 for insurers.

Avik Roy, president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, said that while patients might not notice any changes at the beginning of implementation, the use of external tools will provide returns in the form of higher paychecks that won’t suffer from high health insurance premiums.

“The real value of this transparency is that it’s going to allow for an explosion of new tools and new analytical approaches to identifying who the lowest-cost, highest-quality providers and one particular health care service are,” Roy said, likening the process to searching Expedia for flights instead of checking every airline website. “All of a sudden, you have a system of accountability where hospitals are not going to be able to get away with high prices in competitive markets,” he added.

These tools, Roy continued “allow you to have the lowest cost health insurance plan that still again makes sure that you’re actually covering people with higher quality services.” According to Roy, even people located in rural areas under the control of regional hospitals will be allowed to explore the pros and cons of leaving the area for cheaper, higher quality care.

While the implementation could take time, Roy said the next 10 years of health care will inevitably change for the better with this executive order and ruling. “This is arguably the most significant health care plan in a generation,” Roy said."	right
jv6ihs	conservative	Trump laying groundwork for full US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan before leaving office	"‘ALL WARS MUST END’: In what was labeled as his initial message to all Defense Department employees, acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller walked a fine line, hinting that he may be ordered to oversee the withdrawal of the remaining U.S. troops in Afghanistan, something President Trump said in an Oct. 7 tweet should happen by Christmas.

“This fight has been long, our sacrifices have been enormous. and many are weary of war — I'm one of them — but this is the critical phase in which we transition our efforts from a leadership to supporting role,” wrote Miller, a former Green Beret. “We are not a people of perpetual war — it is the antithesis of everything for which we stand and for which our ancestors fought. All wars must end.”

‘THIS WAR ISN'T OVER’: At the same time, Miller admitted that al Qaeda has not yet been vanquished but was vague about whether defeating al Qaeda in Afghanistan would require a continued troop presence in the country, as advocated by President-elect Joe Biden.

“This war isn't over,” Miller wrote. “We are on the verge of defeating al Qaeda and its associates, but we must avoid our past strategic error of failing to see the fight through to the finish.”

ESPER OPPOSED HASTY WITHDRAWAL: By firing Mark Esper last week and installing retired Army Col. Douglas Macgregor as chief adviser to Miller, Trump swept away the civilian leaders who would resist a withdrawal before the Taliban makes good on its pledge to reduce violence and negotiate in good faith with the U.S.-backed Afghan government.

According to the Washington Post, Esper sent a classified memo to the White House this month expressing concerns about additional cuts. “Conditions on the ground were not yet right,” Esper reportedly argued, citing “the ongoing violence, possible dangers to the remaining troops in the event of a rapid pullout, potential damage to alliances and apprehension about undercutting the negotiations.”

Macgregor, a frequent Fox News contributor, is among those who argue its long past time for the U.S. to get out of Afghanistan after 19 years of war.

NO NEW DIRECTIVE: “There is no new mission directive — nothing has changed,” a senior White House official told the Washington Examiner’s Jerry Dunleavy. The official with knowledge of the recent moves at the Pentagon said the goal is to fulfill Trump’s longtime promises to kill bad guys, free American hostages held overseas, and wind down U.S. combat troop levels around the world, especially in Afghanistan.

“He wants to bring the troops home. He wants to end the wars,” the official said.

LOGISTICS, LOGISTICS, LOGISTICS: It’s an axiom of warfighting that battles are won by logistics, and the logistical problem of pulling 4,000 to 5,000 troops and their equipment out of Afghanistan in less than ten weeks may be the one thing that stymies Trump’s desire to complete the pullout before he leaves office.

“The president needs to recognize that battlefield reality doesn't often comport with a political calendar. If he wants troops out of Afghanistan, as I know most Americans do, we have to do it in a way that makes sense, in an orderly manner, and that comports with battlefield reality,” said former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson on ABC’s This Week. “And, you know, Donald Trump, the dealmaker, should also appreciate that in trying to strike a deal, you don't unilaterally surrender your greatest point of leverage by unilaterally withdrawing troops before the Afghan government and the Taliban have stuck a deal.”

FORMER COMMANDERS WEIGH IN: The prospect of U.S. troops making a hasty pre-inaugural departure from Afghanistan was met with alarm by some of America’s recently retired four-star commanders.

“Simply saying ‘everyone home by Christmas’ and pulling the last few thousand troops out of Afghan has emotional appeal, but makes no sense,” tweeted retired Adm. James Staviridis, former supreme NATO commander. “We are close to a peace agreement — cutting out now will crater it.”

“Nobody wants ‘Endless Wars.’ Including ‘the Generals’ (never met one who does, especially, those of us who have children serving this country),” tweeted former Special Operations Commander retired Gen. Tony Thomas. “The discussion (less cliche) should be is have we achieved the end state of sustainable security so that we never have another 9/11?”

LET THE TRANSITION BEGIN: The top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee is part of the chorus of Trump critics who argue that the president is harming national security by delaying cooperation with the Biden transition team.

“No one likes to lose, but President Trump is recklessly and pointlessly blocking the transition to protect his own ego,” said Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed in a statement. “The reality is Joe Biden won with a record-breaking number of votes and President Trump’s blockade on information and resources only makes the country less safe and puts more people’s health at risk.”

“President Trump’s baseless conspiracy theories and failure to recognize basic facts are further evidence of his lack of respect for our democracy and an insult to the American people,” Reed said. “President-elect Biden must be given access to high-level intelligence briefings and all the other transition resources he needs to ensure a smooth, complete, peaceful transition of power.”

‘I CONCEDE NOTHING’: As tens of thousands of Trump supporters rallied in Washington, Trump tweeted that Biden’s victory was a sham. “He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!”

Last week, a statement from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency called the Nov. 3 election “the most secure in American history.”

THE DEMISE OF AL QAEDA'S NO. 2: As first reported by the New York Times, and corroborated by other news organizations including the Associated Press, the United States and Israel worked together to assassinate Abu Mohammed al Masri, al Qaeda’s No. 2, in Tehran Aug. 7, the anniversary of the 1998 embassy attacks in Africa he was accused of plotting.

“Around 9:00 on a warm summer night, he was driving his white Renault L90 sedan with his daughter near his home when two gunmen on a motorcycle drew up beside him. Five shots were fired from a pistol fitted with a silencer. Four bullets entered the car through the driver’s side and a fifth hit a nearby car,” the New York Times reported.

In a 20-tweet long thread on Twitter, the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies’ Thomas Joscelyn, editor of the Long War Journal, lays out some of the background behind the killing of al Masri, who has long been on the FBI’s most wanted list.

“We've suspected that the U.S. increased its efforts to take out senior al-Qaeda leaders across multiple countries this year. Abu Muhammad al-Masri is one in a string of operatives to perish in recent months, but he was the most senior,” Joscelyn writes, noting, “On 9/17, Christopher Miller (then NCTC director, now acting SecDef) told Congress that ‘several’ of al-Qaeda's ‘remaining senior leaders continue to find safe haven in Iran, and will likely play a key role in the group’s efforts to reconstitute its leadership.’”

SPACE FORCE COMMANDER BACK: Space Force Gen. David Thompson, the vice chief of space operations, is back at work at the Pentagon after a two-week quarantine following a positive COVID-19 test.

Thompson was asymptomatic but tested positive after close contact with a family member. He returned to work Nov. 9, according to the Air Force.

MFO SOLDIERS ID’D: The Army has identified the five American soldiers who died in last week’s Black Hawk helicopter crash in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula.

All were serving as part of peacekeeping operations with the Multinational Force and Observers mission set up to monitor the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. They are:



Capt. Seth Vernon Vandekamp , 31, from Katy, Texas.

, 31, from Katy, Texas. Chief Warrant Officer 3 Dallas Gearld Garza , 34, from Fayetteville, N.C.

, 34, from Fayetteville, N.C. Chief Warrant Officer 2 Marwan Sameh Ghabour , 27, from Marlborough, Mass.

, 27, from Marlborough, Mass. Staff Sgt. Kyle Robert McKee , 35, from Painesville, Ohio.

lnozpp	conservative	AOC calls for ‘full investigation’ into Cuomo nursing home scandal	"New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Friday joined Republican and Democratic state lawmakers calling for a “full investigation” into Gov. Andrew Cuomo‘s treatment of COVID-19-positive nursing home patients and the underreporting of related deaths.

“I support our state’s return to co-equal governance and stand with our local officials calling for a full investigation of the Cuomo administration’s handling of nursing homes during COVID-19,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement.

“Thousands of vulnerable New Yorkers lost their lives in nursing homes throughout the pandemic,” she said. “Their loved ones and the public deserve answers and transparency from their elected leadership, and the secretary to the governor’s remarks warrant a full investigation.”

Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was referring to Melissa DeRosa, a top aide to Mr. Cuomo who revealed last week during a private virtual meeting with state lawmakers that the administration purposely withheld the state’s COVID-19 nursing home death toll out of fears it could be used against them politically.

The governor later admitted that he prioritized getting the data to the federal Department of Justice instead of to the state Legislature and the public, causing an informational “void” that was then filled by “conspiracy theories.”

Mr. Cuomo doubled down on his comments Friday, shortly before Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s statement, saying during a press conference, “I was not aggressive enough in knocking down the falsities. We were busy. We were doing our job. We’re trying to save lives. No excuses.”

The U.S. attorney in Brooklyn and the FBI have begun a preliminary investigation into the Cuomo administration’s treatment of nursing homes.

lb6xmo	conservative	CNN ratings plummet 44% in first week since Trump left office	"Left-wing networks CNN and MSNBC relied almost exclusively on anti-Trump content to attract viewership over the past four years and now that the Republican president has exited office, those same networks are witnessing their ratings nosedive at unprecedented levels.

What are the details?

In the first week since Trump left office, CNN's ratings during primetime hours (8 p.m. through 10 p.m. EST) plummeted by a whopping 44%, according to Variety Intelligence Platform's analysis of the viewership data. To determine the changes in viewership, Variety analyzed data across two key metrics — the target news demographic of people ages 25-54 and total audience.

During the same week, MSNBC's primetime ratings fell as well, though not as sharply as CNN's. The network's audience decreased nearly 20% during the 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. slots, and fell by 11% during the 9 p.m. slot.

Meanwhile, Fox News saw its primetime ratings decrease only slightly during the 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. slot and not at all at 8 p.m. when ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" is broadcast.

The program hit hardest, according to Variety, was ""Cuomo Prime Time"" airing at 9 p.m., which saw its audience of 25-54 year-olds fall by more than half.

Why does it matter?

It should be noted that CNN's fall was made more dramatic by the fact that the network performed so well in the month of January as Trump's term drew to a close. The network overtook ratings behemoth Fox News amid its coverage of the Capitol riot, impeachment proceedings, and then President Joe Biden's inauguration.

But for as much as CNN and MSNBC seemed to despise the Trump presidency, the networks may soon wish it were back if for no other reason than to drive business.

Variety acknowledged as much in its report, saying, ""While it's too early to conclude any longer-term direction for news ratings after just one week, the downturn could be interpreted as an indicator of what many industry observers had anticipated: With Biden in the White House, networks that have spent the last four years railing consistently against Trump have lost the main attraction that energized their audience bases, making it difficult to hold onto the elevated viewing levels.""

What else?

It remains to be seen if the low viewership for CNN and MSNBC remains, and if it does, how the networks will respond. But if you're expecting they will course-correct and begin leaning more conservatively, you shouldn't hold your breath, especially as the Senate's impeachment trial against Trump looms."	right

WASHINGTON, D.C.—President Trump has announced a ban of TikTok after his first video on the platform got zero views, sources confirmed Saturday.

Trump reportedly worked really hard at the video, recording over 70 takes until he found one he liked. In the video, Trump does an ""excellent performance"" of the Macarena. He was reportedly really proud of the video and so was crestfallen when he got no likes or views after a few minutes.

""It's obviously a dumb platform with only stupid people,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""My video was clearly the best on the platform, and if America doesn't get that, then America doesn't deserve to use TikTok. People on there were doing the dumbest dances: the Renegade. That dumb 'na na na' song. No one was doing the classics. Whatever happened to the YMCA?""

No matter the reason he banned the app, Trump's approval rating shot up thirty points on the announcement."	right
j6bjjt	conservative	Netflix Indicted for ‘Lewd Exhibition’ of Children in ‘Cuties’ Film by Texas Grand Jury	"A Tyler County Grand Jury has indicted Netflix for promoting the “lewd exhibition” of children.

After speaking out alongside other Texas politicians against the French Netflix film Cuties and asking the state attorney general’s office to investigate the film for violations, Texas Rep. Matt Schaefer (R-Tyler) tweeted a photo of the indictment this morning.

“Netflix, Inc… knowingly promote[d] visual material which depicts the lewd exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of a clothed or partially clothed child who was younger than 18 years of age at the time the visual material was created, which appeals to the prurient interest in sex,” the indictment reads.

The Texas Rangers served the indictment to Netflix.

Tyler County Criminal District Attorney Lucas Babin, who presented the indictment, said the wide distribution of the film spurs “more, not less” legal action on the part of legal officials as local as Texas.

“As a district attorney, I have to sift through countless cases and make calls every day on how to keep our communities safe… After hearing about the movie Cuties and watching it, I knew there was probable cause to believe it was criminal under Section 43.262 of the Texas Penal Code,” Babin wrote.

“The legislators of this state believe promoting certain lewd material of children has destructive consequences. If such material is distributed on a grand scale, isn’t the need to prosecute more, not less?”

The indictment fulfills Schaefer’s prediction that legal experts would classify the film as pornographic. Schaefer had also said the film could potentially face prosecution as “distribution of harmful material” for its inevitable exposure to young boys.

“If this is legal, then literally anybody with a camera can get an underage girl, very young girl, and have her do nearly anything as long as there is the thinnest piece of fabric covering her body,” Schaefer told The Texan last month. “Ultimately, we have to realize that this film is gonna be seen by a lot of 12, 13, 14, 15, 16-year old boys. How is that not material harmful to a minor?”

The controversial release of the fictional film, which follows a twelve-year-old girl’s foray into a provocative dance group, kindled outrage and prompted several Texas Republicans to action.

Senator Bob Hall (R-Canton) swore to file a bill that would outlaw pedophilia in the state constitution, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton joined two other state attorney generals in a letter asking Netflix to remove the film, and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) asked U.S. Attorney General William Barr to investigate the company for “the filming of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct.” State Rep. James White (R-Tyler) likewise wrote Paxton asking for an investigation into the film.

Editor’s note: The piece has been updated with information about the involvement of the Texas Rangers and with quotes from the Tyler County District Attorney.

lpo46b	conservative	Court Docs Show Facebook Played Much Bigger Part In Capitol Riot Than Parler, Yet No Consequences -- If any single platform can be fingered as the favorite of the rioters, it appears to be Facebook. Yet Facebook remains unmolested by app stores and untargeted by opportunistic politicians.	"If any single platform can be fingered as the favorite of the rioters, it appears to be Facebook. Yet Facebook remains unmolested by app stores and untargeted by opportunistic politicians.

It’s been more than a month since the app stores of Google and Apple joined forces with Amazon Web Services to knee-cap an upstart competitor, Parler. The stated reasoning was Parler’s lack of content moderation policies, which Apple, in particular, claimed led to Parler’s use as a forum to “plan, coordinate, and facilitate the illegal activities in Washington DC on January 6, 2021.”

This reasoning was confidently repeated across the corporate press. “The Capitol mob began organizing . . . on platforms like Parler and Gab,” Vox asserted. Planning for the “mob violence that descended on the U.S. Capitol . . . took place openly on websites popular with far-right conspiracy theorists,” National Public Radio proclaimed. Facebook shut down Stop the Steal groups, said The New York Times, so planning moved to Parler and Gab.

“These events were largely organized on platforms that don’t have our abilities to stop hate and don’t have our standards and don’t have our transparency,” sniffed Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer.

Based on such confident allegations, and the swift, collective action of Amazon, Google, and Apple, one is left with the impression that Parler—a platform that last month boasted 15 million total users, compared to Twitter’s 187 million daily users and Facebook’s mammoth 1.8 billion users a day—facilitated the entirety of the Jan. 6events.

Indeed, within days, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., dashed off a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, demanding the agency undertake a “robust examination” of Parler’s role in “the assault, including as a potential facilitator of planning and incitement related to the violence, as a repository of key evidence posted by users on its site, and as a potential conduit for foreign governments who may be financing civil unrest in the United States.”

Arbiters of Truth Push More Fake News

The problem with all of this is that it turned out to be mostly wrong. Yes, Parler was used, in some form, to promote and discuss the violent aspects of Jan. 6. But so too were other major social media platforms—and in a much larger way than Parler.

The Department of Justice has now charged 223 people for their participation in the events of Jan. 6. A comprehensive analysis of those charging documents performed by Forbes demonstrate that Parler’s role was minimal, compared to that of Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram.

Of the 223 charging documents, 73 reference posts on Facebook as evidence, 24 reference posts YouTube, 20 single out Instagram posts (owned by Facebook), and only eight highlight posts on Parler.

Was Parler involved? Yes. Was the platform the virtual Bat Cave of Incitement and Violence that Apple, Google, Amazon, and thoroughly un-critical press reporting made it out to be? Hardly. If any single platform can be fingered as the favorite of the rioters, it appears to be Facebook.

Yet Facebook remains unmolested by the respective app stores and is suffering no critiques from opportunistic politicians. Somehow, Facebook—which, in 2018, was used to facilitate a genocide in Myanmar, and still can’t manage to stop ISIS from circulating recruitment materials—is Teflon in the face of the same charges that take down competitors like Parler, one of the very few Big Tech alternatives that has managed to break through to mainstream status.

And that is because this issue is not really about content moderation policies. It’s about narrative control.

A Free Market Means Companies Control You?

Over the last two decades, Big Tech companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, and Amazon have amassed unchallenged dominance over the global flow of information—so much that should a user be banned across multiple platforms, he is effectively shut off from speaking with ease into the public square, which is now largely digital.

Sure, he could go post in some obscure corner of the Internet with only a few hundred users, but that misses the point of how Americans have always understood free speech. It’s not merely about the opportunity to speak; it’s also about who hears.

By selling the argument that speaking on Bitchute or Diaspora is somehow exactly the same as reaching billions of people on Facebook or Twitter, Big Tech has successfully convinced conservatives to accept de-platforming as just another function of the free market. Instead of identifying that argument as specious (Big Tech companies benefit from government largess in a handful of ways and are predatory monopolies), conservatives have acquiesced, meekly shuffling off to cluster in dusty corners of the Internet.

Threatening the Speech Cartel

Meanwhile, by working together to silence viewpoints and dissent across multiple platforms, Big Tech can effectively remove the ability of entire groups of people to engage and persuade in the public square.

That is, until Parler. Parler was able to do what no other alternative to Big Tech has been: achieve mainstream status as a viable competitor. By operating its platform in a more First Amendment-friendly way, Parler threatened to upend the Big Tech speech cartel.

That was never supposed to happen. This was obvious in the way the Big Tech-financed “build your own” crowd responded to Parler: first by mercilessly mocking its entrance to the market, then by nodding approvingly at the pretext used for its demise. It was also obvious when Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter, Parler’s most direct competitor, tweeted a heart emoji of thanks when Parler no longer appeared in Apple’s app store.

Big Tech doesn’t want market competition. But they also don’t want competition for information and narrative control. Conservatives reaching critical mass on another platform just cannot be allowed. Thus Jan. 6, for all of its horrible events, offered a convenient and successful excuse by which Big Tech could solve its Parler problem—even though the DOJ charging documents have now made clear that Parler’s role was minor.

No Banks For You

Perhaps even more disturbing, however, is that by colluding to axe Parler, Amazon, Apple, and Google didn’t just crush a speech platform, they killed a small business. That kind of power resonates far beyond an inability to access the public square.

Big Tech can shut down your speech, but also your ability to make money in America. They can ban you from the public square, as well as from the avenues and infrastructure of capitalism.

This type of collusive power was very much on display when every platform from the online retail service Shopify, to the credit card processing company Stripe, to email services, ad accounts, banks, and every major social media platform refused to work with President Trump or his campaign. The same was true with Parler, which was effectively rendered dead in the water when Google and Apple removed it from their app stores, choking the app from the oxygen it needs to survive, as well as the avenues it needs to access a mainstream audience.

Although Parler is clinging to life on a new web hosting service, the left is already protesting its limited resurrection, and it remains banned from any commercial reach in the app stores.

This Isn’t a Free Market At All

The lengths Big Tech will go to maintain both their market dominance and information control has unmasked how powerful they truly are, and how unafraid they are of any consequence. Far from being single private actors subject to the fierce winds of market competition, they are a dominant oligopoly that acts in concert to stamp out viewpoint diversity, dissent, and the free flow of information.

Equally as critically, they act together to rip the infrastructure of capitalism away from individuals and entitles when it suits them, or their masters in the Democratic Party. Mario Loyola, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, was correct when he characterized our present condition as a “dystopic market state” in which Big Tech acts as compliant pillars of one-party rule.

The contours of our democratic society are in a power struggle with corporate actors who are rivaling the state for control. There has never been a more urgent time for the people, acting through our self-government, to take back the power Big Tech has so eagerly usurped."	right

jvz66c	conservative	Trump orders Pentagon to pull 2,500 troops from Afghanistan and Iraq	"President Trump Donald TrumpTrump's Facebook ban to stay in place, board rules Trump allies launching nonprofit focused on voter fraud DOJ asks for outside lawyer to review Giuliani evidence MORE has ordered the Pentagon to pull 2,500 U.S. troops from Afghanistan and Iraq by mid-January, acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller announced Tuesday.

The Defense Department will cut the number of troops in Afghanistan from 4,500 to 2,500 and the number of forces in Iraq from 3,000 to 2,500 by Jan. 15, days before Trump is set to leave office.

“I am formally announcing that we will implement President Trump’s orders to continue our repositioning of forces” from Afghanistan and Iraq, Miller told reporters at the Pentagon.

ADVERTISEMENT

Miller also said that Trump’s decision “is based on continuous engagement with his national security Cabinet for the past several months, including ongoing discussions with me and my colleagues across the United States government.”

He added that he spoke with “key leaders in Congress as well as our allies and partners abroad to update them on these plans” earlier in the day.

Ahead of Miller's announcement, a senior Defense official told reporters that the drawdown was a “collaborative decision,"" but would not say which military leaders had recommended the plan.

The official also would not say which conditions had been met by the Taliban to warrant such a drawdown in Afghanistan, but insisted that U.S. national security will not be threatened and the troops remaining overseas will still be able to assist allies and partners in Afghanistan and Iraq.

The remaining 2,500 troops “can accomplish everything we have been doing,” the official said.

The drawdown order — which contradicts months of previous advice from top Defense officials — comes a week after Trump fired Defense Secretary Mark Esper Mark EsperCourt declines to dismiss Amazon challenge against JEDI decision Inspector general chose not to investigate Secret Service in clearing of Lafayette Square: report The paradox of US-India relations MORE and replaced him with Miller.

Esper’s ouster also set off a leadership purge at the Pentagon, with several of those positions now filled by Trump loyalists.

ADVERTISEMENT

The departures appeared to help clear the way for Trump to order the hasty drawdown, as the military has long argued against going below 4,500 troops in Afghanistan.

Conditions on the ground do not warrant a further drawdown, they have said, as the Taliban has failed to uphold its agreement with the United States for peace in the country.

Days before Trump fired Esper, for example, the Pentagon head sent a classified memo to the president advising that the conditions were not sufficient in Afghanistan for any further troop withdrawals, as it could possibly undermine peace talks, The Washington Post reported.

The senior Defense official on Tuesday would not address the document, telling reporters ""we’re not going to comment on any memo that you may or may not have in your possession.”

The official also insisted that ""there is no contradiction with the president and his national security Cabinet.”

The sentiment that a further drawdown wouldn't be prudent was repeated in a Pentagon watchdog report released only hours before Trump's order, which found that the Taliban has conducted a “small number” of attacks against U.S.-led coalition forces in Afghanistan, despite its February agreement with the administration banning such attacks.

The Operation Freedom’s Sentinel inspector general report marks the first official confirmation that the Taliban has launched attacks against coalition forces in violation of the U.S.-Taliban deal.

Further highlighting the discrepancy between Tuesday's announcement and previous military opinion, the Pentagon told the inspector general that once it reached 4,500 troops in Afghanistan, it would “pause troop reductions and assess the situation.”

National security adviser Robert O’Brien briefly addressed the drawdowns at the White House on Tuesday, telling reporters that the decision fulfilled Trump’s campaign promise to bring an end to America’s “endless wars.”

“Four years ago, President Trump ran on a promise to put a stop to America’s endless wars,” O’Brien said. “President Trump is keeping that promise to the American people.”

He confirmed the troop reduction by mid-January, with the remaining forces meant to defend embassies and other government facilities and diplomats, and deter foes.

“By May, it is President Trump's hope that they will all come home safely and in their entirety,” O’Brien said. “I want to reiterate that this policy is not new. This has been the president’s policy since he took office.”

O’Brien also said he had just spoken to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg regarding the alliance’s contributions to national security and security of overseas missions like those in Iraq and Afghanistan.

While Trump has long promised to return U.S. troops stateside, he announced early in his presidency that he would increase troop levels in Afghanistan from 8,600 to roughly 14,000 at the advice of military advisers.

ADVERTISEMENT

Since then, his administration has moved to lower that number and in February officials signed a conditional peace deal with the Taliban that calls for a full U.S. withdrawal by May if the group upholds certain commitments such as denying safe haven to al Qaeda.

Since the deal was signed, however, the Taliban has stepped up attacks against Afghan forces, which U.S. officials have repeatedly condemned as threatening the peace process. Officials have also warned that further drawdowns without a show from the Taliban that they are adhering to the agreement will weaken the U.S. position in peace talks.

The senior Defense official insisted on Tuesday that despite the drawdown, talks with the Taliban “are still very much ongoing. ... Our goal is the peace deal.""

Trump’s decision was met with swift condemnation from lawmakers in his own party, including House Armed Services Committee ranking member Mac Thornberry William (Mac) McClellan ThornberryUnnamed law enforcement banned under the new NDAA Lobbying world Senate poised to override Trump's defense bill veto MORE (R-Texas), who called the reductions “a mistake.”

""I believe that these additional reductions of American troops from terrorist areas are a mistake. Further reductions in Afghanistan will also undercut negotiations there; the Taliban has done nothing — met no condition — that would justify this cut,” Thornberry said in a statement. “As long as there are threats to Americans and American national security in the world, the U.S. must be vigilant, strong, and engaged in order to safeguard our people and fulfill our duty under the Constitution.”

And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellSchumer works to balance a divided caucus's demands Lobbying world The Memo: Biden moves into new phase of COVID-19 fight MORE (R-Ky.) warned Monday that only a ""small minority"" in Congress would support a rapid drawdown, which he said ""would hurt our allies and delight, delight, the people who wish us harm.""

Stoltenberg, meanwhile, has warned of a “very high” price if U.S. and allied forces leave Afghanistan too rapidly, cautioning that the region ""risks becoming once again a platform for international terrorists to plan and organize attacks on our homelands."" ADVERTISEMENT NATO leads the international security effort in Afghanistan where it trains and advises Afghan security forces. Of the roughly 12,000 troops that make up the joint counterterrorism mission, known as Resolute Support, more than half are non-U.S. soldiers. “We now face a difficult decision,” Stoletenberg said in a statement on Tuesday. “We have been in Afghanistan for almost 20 years, and no NATO ally wants to stay any longer than necessary. But at the same time, the price for leaving too soon or in an uncoordinated way could be very high.""

The United States has had forces in Afghanistan since October 2001 after the 9/11 terror attacks, seeking to oust al Qaeda militants who had planned the attack from there. Washington also sent its troops to invade Iraq in 2003 based on inaccurate intelligence that claimed then-President Saddam Hussein held weapons of mass destruction that were a threat to the United States.

jynr36	conservative	High family income, not SAT scores, is your real ticket to Harvard, Yale, and Princeton	"Text Size: A- A+

First, the SAT, it turns out, does not measure scholarly aptitude or native intelligence independent of social and educational background. To the contrary, SAT scores are highly correlated with wealth. The higher your family income, the higher your SAT score. At each successive rung on the income ladder, average SAT scores increase. For scores that put students in contention for the most selective colleges, the gap is especially stark. If you come from a family with an annual income greater than $200,000, your chance of scoring above 1400 (out of 1600) is one in five. If you come from a poor family (less than $20,000 per year), your chance is one in fifty. Those in high-scoring categories are also, overwhelmingly, children of parents with college degrees.

Beyond the general educational advantages well-off families can provide, the SAT scores of the privileged are boosted by the use of private test- prep courses and tutors. Some, in places like Manhattan, charge as much as $1,000 per hour for one-on-one tutoring. As meritocratic competition for college admission has intensified in recent decades, tutoring and test prep has become a billion-dollar industry.

For years, the College Board, which administers the SAT, insisted that its test measured aptitude and that scores were unaffected by tutoring. It recently dropped that pretense and entered a partnership with the Khan Academy to provide free online SAT practice to all test takers. Although this was a worthy undertaking, it did little to level the test-prep playing field, as College Board officials hoped and claimed it would. Unsurprisingly perhaps, students from families with higher incomes and education levels made greater use of the online help than did students from disadvantaged backgrounds, resulting in an even greater scoring gap between the privileged and the rest.

For James Bryant Conant, an American chemist and former president of Harvard University, a test of aptitude or IQ held promise as a democratic measure of academic ability, untainted by educational disadvantage and the vagaries of high school grades. This is why he opted for the SAT to choose his scholarship students. He would be surprised to learn that high school grades are better than SAT scores at identifying low-income students who are likely to succeed in college.

While high school grades are to some extent correlated with family income, SAT scores are more so. This is partly because, contrary to long-standing claims by the testing industry, the SAT is coachable. Private tutoring helps, and a profitable industry has arisen to teach high school students the gimmicks and tricks to boost their scores.

Meritocracy entrenches inequality

Second, the system of meritocratic admission that Conant promoted did not lead to the classless society he hoped it would produce. Inequalities of income and wealth have deepened since the 1940s and 1950s, and the social mobility that Conant saw as the remedy for a stratified society has not come about. The haves and have-nots have not been trading places from one generation to the next. As we have seen, relatively few children of the poor rise to affluence, and relatively few children of affluence fall below the ranks of the upper-middle class. Notwithstanding the American dream of rising from rags to riches, upward mobility is less common in the United States than in many European countries, and there is no evidence of improvement in recent decades.

The favoritism that Harvard, Yale, and Princeton long accorded young men from upper-class boarding schools receded in the 1960s and 1970s. So did the routine admission to Ivy League colleges of any minimally qualified son of an alumnus. Academic standards improved and median SAT scores increased. The best-endowed colleges and universities adopted need-blind admissions and generous financial-aid policies, removing a major financial barrier for promising students of modest means.

These are the undeniable achievements. And yet, the meritocratic revolution in higher education did not bring about the social mobility and broad opportunity that its early proponents expected and that educational leaders and politicians continue to promise. America’s selective colleges and universities ousted the complacent, entitled, hereditary elite that worried Conant. But this aristocracy of inherited privilege has given way to a meritocratic elite that is now as privileged and entrenched as the one it replaced.

Though far more inclusive in terms of gender, race, and ethnicity, this meritocratic elite has not produced a fluid, mobile society. Instead, today’s credentialed, professional classes have figured out how to pass their privileges on to their children, not by bequeathing them large estates but by equipping them with the advantages that determine success in a meritocratic society.

Notwithstanding its newfound role as the arbiter of opportunity and the engine of upward mobility, higher education has not provided a significant counterweight to the rising inequality of recent times. Consider the class composition of higher education today, especially in its most selective domains:

Most students at selective colleges and universities are from affluent families; very few are from low-income backgrounds. More than 70 percent of those who attend the hundred or so most competitive colleges in the United States come from the top quarter of the income scale; only 3 percent come from the bottom quarter.

The wealth gap in college enrollment is most acute at the top. At Ivy League colleges, Stanford, Duke, and other prestigious places, there are more students from the wealthiest 1 percent of families than from the entire bottom half of the country. At Yale and Princeton, only about one student in fifty comes from a poor family (bottom 20 percent).

If you come from a rich family (top 1 percent), your chances of attending an Ivy League school are 77 times greater than if you come from a poor family (bottom 20 percent). Most young people from the bottom half of the income scale attend a two-year college or none at all.

Over the last two decades, elite private colleges have offered more generous financial aid, and the federal government has increased college funding for students of modest means. Harvard and Stanford, for example, now provide free tuition, room, and board to any student whose family makes less than $65,000 per year. Despite these measures, however, the share of students from low-income families at selective colleges has changed little since 2000 and in some cases has drifted downward. The percentage of “first generation” students (the first in their families to attend college) at Harvard today is no higher than it was in 1960. Jerome Karabel, the author of a history of admissions policies at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, concludes that “the children of the working class and the poor are about as unlikely to attend the Big Three [Harvard, Yale, and Princeton] today as they were in 1954.”

Why elite colleges are not engines of mobility

The academic reputations, scientific contributions, and rich educational offerings of America’s leading colleges and universities are admired throughout the world. But these institutions are not effective engines of upward mobility. Recently, the economist Raj Chetty and a team of colleagues undertook a comprehensive study of the role of colleges in promoting intergenerational mobility, examining the economic trajectory of 30 million college students from 1999 to 2013. For each college in the United States, they calculated the proportion of its students who rose from the bottom rung on the income ladder to the top (i.e., from the bottom quintile to the top quintile). They asked, in other words, what proportion of students at each college came from a poor family but wound up earning enough to reach the top 20 percent. Their finding: higher education today does surprisingly little to promote upward mobility.

This is especially true at elite private colleges. Although attending a place like Harvard or Princeton does give a poor kid a good chance of rising, such places enroll so few poor kids to begin with that their mobility rate is low. Only 1.8 percent of Harvard students (and only 1.3 percent at Princeton) rise from the bottom to the top of the income scale.

One might expect things to be different at the major public universities. But they, too, enroll so many already-affluent students that they contribute little to upward mobility.

Taken together, the 1,800 colleges and universities Chetty studied—private and public, selective and non-selective—enabled fewer than 2 percent of their students to rise from the bottom fifth of the income scale to the top fifth. Some might ask whether propelling students, in one generation, from the bottom quintile ($20,000 family income or less) to the top ($110,000 income or more) is too demanding a test of mobility. But even more modest ascents are relatively rare. At elite private colleges and universities, only about one student in ten manages to rise even two rungs (two quintiles) on the income ladder.

American colleges and universities enable surprisingly few students to rise, despite the fact that attending such places does enhance one’s economic prospects. College graduates, especially from prestigious places, do have a major edge in landing lucrative jobs. But these schools have little impact on upward mobility, because most of their students are well-off in the first place. American higher education is like an elevator in a building that most people enter on the top floor.

In practice, most colleges and universities do less to expand opportunity than to consolidate privilege. For those who look to higher education as the primary vehicle of opportunity, this is sobering news. It calls into question an article of faith in contemporary politics—that the answer to rising inequality is greater mobility, and that the way to increase mobility is to send more people to college.

hvk5ie	conservative	Trump speaks on Ghislaine Maxwell: ‘I wish her well, frankly’	"President Trump said Tuesday that he wishes the best for Ghislaine Maxwell, who is jailed on charges she helped convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein procure underage girls.

“I don’t know, I haven’t really been following it too much. I just wish her well, frankly,” Trump said when asked whether he thinks she will use what she reportedly knows about other powerful men to get herself out of trouble.

“I’ve met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach and I guess they lived in Palm Beach, but I wish her well.”

The president told reporters he doesn’t know if Prince Andrew is guilty of misconduct.

“Whatever it is, I don’t know the situation with Prince Andrew, I just don’t know. I’m not aware of that,” Trump said.

Maxwell, 58, has denied any wrongdoing. She is expected to spend a year awaiting trial at the Brooklyn Detention Center, where she has been held since shortly after her July 2 arrest in New Hampshire.

Epstein was arrested for sex-trafficking by the same US Attorney’s Office last year — but committed suicide in his Lower Manhattan jail cell before he could face trial.

Trump condemned Epstein’s private Caribbean island as an “absolute cesspool” in a 2015 interview and implicated Andrew in misconduct there.

“Just ask Prince Andrew. He’ll tell you about it,” Trump said at the time.

The British royal denies underage rape allegations from Virginia Roberts, who says she was trafficked by Epstein and Maxwell. Former President Bill Clinton also reportedly visited the island near Saint Thomas in the US Virgin Islands.

Prince Andrew is refusing to cooperate with prosecutors and withdrew from royal duties last year after claiming in a disastrous interview that Roberts was lying in her account because he could not sweat.

Trump told reporters last year that he had a falling out with Epstein long ago, but didn’t say why.

“I knew him like everybody in Palm Beach knew him,” Trump told reporters. “He was a fixture of Palm Beach. I had a falling out with him a long time ago, I don’t think I’ve spoken to him for 15 years. I wasn’t a fan.”"	right

lbsdm7	conservative	Andrew Cuomo Announces Indoor Dining Can Resume Despite Coronavirus Being Worse Than When He Banned It	"Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Friday that indoor dining can resume in New York City on Valentine’s Day, despite nearly every coronavirus metric being worse than it was when he banned indoor dining in the first place.

When Cuomo announced Dec. 11 that indoor dining would be banned in New York City, the 7-day average of coronavirus cases per 100,000 people in the city was 40.2, according to data from the New York Times. When he announced Jan. 29 that indoor dining could resume, that number was 66.1 – 64% higher than the average per-capita case counts in December.

As the governor spoke on Friday, citing the “current trajectory” of cases as his reasoning for reopening, average per-capita case counts in New York City were 64% higher than when he announced the ban in December. https://t.co/wq2vGtvEjg pic.twitter.com/Td37O4OiyW — The New York Times (@nytimes) February 2, 2021

Average hospitalizations per 100,000 people also rose from December to January. There was a 7-day average of 209 coronavirus hospitalizations per 100,000 people on Dec. 11, and on Jan. 28, the 7-day average was 335 hospitalizations, according to the New York Times. The 7-day average test positivity rate was 4.0% when the ban was announced, and 5.3% when it was announced that the ban would be lifted. (RELATED: ‘Wildly Irresponsible’: CNN’s Tapper, Gupta Slam Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s Latest Statement On Pandemic)

Average Covid-19 hospitalizations in the city, while trending downward, were still 60% higher late last week than they were when Mr. Cuomo closed the restaurants. https://t.co/wq2vGtvEjg pic.twitter.com/TGrYF1DNwM — The New York Times (@nytimes) February 2, 2021

Out of the four metrics that Cuomo said are used to determine reopening plans – new case numbers, hospitalizations, the test positivity rate, and the infection rate – the last metric is the only one that has improved. The rate at which people are infecting each other is now between 1.03 and 0.95, meaning each person who gets coronavirus will infect approximately one other person, state officials said according to the New York Times.

Gareth Rhodes, a member of Cuomo’s COVID task force and a deputy superintendent at the state Department of Financial Services, said that what matters is how the metrics are trending, not where the numbers are. He told the New York Times that in both the state and the city, each metric is trending downward, but in December, case numbers and hospitalizations were trending upward. In May, Rhodes said, the economy also began reopening despite over 6,000 hospitalizations because the metrics were trending downwards.

During his press briefing Friday, Cuomo presented numbers that were not reflective of the true trend in coronavirus case positivity rates, a New York Times analysis of data shows. Cuomo displayed a chart showing the positivity rate dropping from 7.1% on Jan. 5 to 4.9% on Jan. 28, but the governor picked the highest and lowest numbers from the month to show the drop rather than looking at the overall trend.

Cuomo’s chart showed an over 30% drop in test positivity rate, but the 7-day average – which accounts for day-to-day fluctuations – showed that from Jan. 5 to Jan. 28, positivity rates fell from 6.4% to 4.9%. That’s still a decrease, but it’s a 17% drop rather than Cuomo’s 30% drop, according to the New York Times data.

The chart Cuomo presented during Friday’s press briefing also did not label the vertical axis, which didn’t begin at zero, according to the Times. That gives the illusion that the numbers were closer to zero than they actually were."	right

jscxk7	conservative	A Portland politician pushing to defund the police, claiming that most calls are not real crimes, recently called 911 herself — over an argument with a Lyft driver who refused to close his window.	"A Portland politician pushing to defund the police, claiming that most calls are not real crimes, recently called 911 herself — over an argument with a Lyft driver who refused to close his window.

City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty — who also oversees Portland’s emergency dispatch system — has repeatedly campaigned to cut police budgets and shift money elsewhere, arguing that the force is inundated with unnecessary calls that don’t involve crimes, according to The Oregonian.

She again called for an $18 million cut last Thursday — four days after she dialed 911 over a ride-share driver who was following Lyft’s coronavirus safety guidelines to keep a window open, the paper said.

Her 911 calls, first obtained by The Oregonian, show her repeatedly demanding the force send out officers — even though the dispatcher insisted no crime had been committed.

“I paid for a ride. He says he canceled it,” Hardesty told the dispatcher, who told her it was the driver’s right to do so. “So I’m going to sit here until he sends me another ride,” she said, with the dispatcher patiently telling her that only she could order one.

When two officers finally arrived in a squad car, the city commissioner got out of the Lyft — and into another ride-share car that pulled up at the same time as the officers, the paper said.

Hardesty later told the Portland Tribune that she “proactively” called police because as a black woman, she feared having officers called on her “would put me in danger.”

“I don’t call 911 lightly, but I certainly am not going to do anything that would put my personal safety at risk,” she said. “It’s a lot harder when you are black or brown in America to make that decision.”

“I am very aware of how unsafe it is for a single woman to be traveling anywhere, especially in this very racially tense time,” she told the paper. “People recognize me everywhere … I just was not going to take that chance.”

However, driver Richmond Frost, 63, told The Oregonian that Hardesty “wasn’t happy” as soon as he picked her up at a casino Sunday night — and flipped when he refused to fully close his window, despite him telling her, “It’s for my safety and your safety.”

“But that was like pouring gas on her fire,” Frost told the paper. “She demanded that I close that window right now. She was kind of ballistic at that point.”

He decided to cancel the ride — charging no money — and pulled into a gas station that he claimed was safely “lit up like a football field.”

When she refused to get out of his four-door Hyundai Ioniq, Frost said he would call the police — with the politician beating him to it.

“I’m not getting out of the car, in the dark, at a filling station, not happening — all because I asked him to put the window up. I’m not leaving,” she told the dispatcher, the calls show.

“He says I’ve got to get out of his car, or he would call the police, so I decided to call for him,” she continued.

Frost — a Lyft driver for four years who has handled more than 18,000 rides — didn’t realize his unruly passenger was a politician, he said.

“That has nothing to do with her political position as a Portland council person,” he told The Oregonian.

“She was very disrespectful to me, made me uncomfortable. I don’t feel like I have to sit in a car for anyone to have to argue unrelentingly and be rude and abusive, telling me what I have to do in my own vehicle.”

After Hardesty complained to Lyft, the company reminded her that “drivers are free to end a ride for any reason” — and warned that “future reports of this nature may lead to additional action being taken on your account.”"	right

kaufki	conservative	Reps. Tulsi Gabbard And Markwayne Mullin Introduce Bill That Would Allow Only Biological Females In Women’s Sports	"Democratic Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Republican Oklahoma Rep. Markwayne Mullin introduced legislation that would clarify Title IX protections for female athletes as based on biological sex, a press release said Thursday.

The “Protect Women’s Sports Act” recognizes the different abilities conferred by biological sex, the statement says. Title IX protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive federal funding.

“Title IX was a historic provision championed by Hawaii’s own Congresswoman Patsy Mink in order to provide equal opportunity for women and girls in high school and college sports,” Gabbard said in the statement. “It led to a generational shift that impacted countless women, creating life-changing opportunities for girls and women that never existed before.”

“However, Title IX is being weakened by some states who are misinterpreting Title IX, creating uncertainty, undue hardship and lost opportunities for female athletes. Our legislation protects Title IX’s original intent which was based on the general biological distinction between men and women athletes based on sex,”

The Supreme Court determined in June that discrimination on the basis of gender identity also constitutes sex discrimination within the meaning of VII of the Civil Rights Act. Weeks prior, the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights decided in a complaint involving Connecticut high school sports that permitting transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports violates the civil rights of female athletes.

Twenty-eight Congressional Democrats signed a letter in June condemning the Department of Education for its ruling, accusing the department of discrimination “against transgender youth” by restricting women’s sports to biological females.

“Title IX was designed to give women and girls an equal chance to succeed, including in sports,” Mullin said. “Allowing biological males to compete in women’s sports diminishes that equality and takes away from the original intent of Title IX.” (RELATED: Connecticut Policy Allowing Transgender Athletes In Sports Found To Violate Female Civil Rights)

“As the father of three girls involved in athletics, I want them to be able to compete on a level playing field. I am proud to lead this bill that will safeguard the integrity of women’s sports and ensure female athletes can compete fairly,” he continued.

Attorney General William Barr became involved in the Connecticut lawsuit in March, when he signed a statement of interest arguing the policy allowing transgender athletes to compete in high school sports “deprives those women of the single-sex athletic competitions that are one of the marquee accomplishments of Title IX.”

“It is critical that the legacy of Title IX continues to ensure women and girls in sports have the opportunity to compete and excel on a level playing field,” Gabbard said in the statement."	right
i3ozke	conservative	This is ‘the cognitive test Trump didn’t pass’: Internet reacts to president’s ‘shocking’ Axios interview	"Last week, Axios political reporter Jonathan Swan teased his HBO interview with President Trump as “one of the most shocking exchanges” he’s ever had with him.

Now, with the whole thing having aired, what had been the signal “shock” moment — Trump’s claiming the intelligence that Russia was funding Taliban targeting of U.S. troops in Afghanistan never reached his desk — just seems to blend in with all the other stuff.

The exchange that gained the most traction on social media, where the chat went viral overnight, finds Trump talking about how his administration has done an “incredible” job of navigating the pandemic and how the outbreak is “under control” despite surging infection numbers.

Swan kicked off the interview by asking whether Trump was employing “wishful thinking” when it comes to a public health crisis that has left more than 155,000 in the U.S. dead.

“I think you have to have a positive outlook — otherwise you would have nothing,” Trump said, pointing again to the travel restrictions he says saved perhaps millions of lives. “Those people that really understand it, that really understand it, they said it’s incredible the job that we’ve done.”

Swan asked how Trump could claim that the outbreak is “under control” when the average daily number of deaths is again more than 1,000.

“They are dying — that’s true. And it is what it is,” Trump said. “But that doesn’t mean we aren’t doing everything we can. It’s under control, as much as you can control it.”

This moment, in particular, was splashed across Twitter TWTR, -1.54% :

Later, the topic shifted to the legacy of late civil-rights hero John Lewis, and Trump wouldn’t budge when it came to joining those across the political spectrum praising Lewis’s impact.

“I don’t know. I don’t know John Lewis. He chose not to come to my inauguration,” Trump said after being asked how he thought Lewis would be remembered. “I never met John Lewis, actually.”

Key Words (January 2017):House veteran John Lewis says Trump won’t be a legitimate president

Swan pushed ahead, asking if Trump found Lewis, who rose to prominence in the civil-rights movement in his early 20s and went on to represent his Atlanta-area district in Congress for more than three decades, to be an impressive figure.

“I can’t say one way or the other. I find a lot of people impressive. I find many people not impressive, but, no, he didn’t come to my inauguration,” Trump said, adding that he’s done more for Black Americans than another other president. “He should’ve come. I think he made a big mistake.”

And when given the chance to perhaps adjust his earlier well-wishes for Ghislaine Maxwell, the former confidante of Jeffrey Epstein who has been charged with trafficking underage girls, Trump maintained his show of support and stoked the flames of a conspiracy theory.

“Her boyfriend died in jail, and people are still trying to figure out how did it happen, was it suicide, was he killed?” he said. “I do wish her well. I’m not looking for anything bad for her.”

hjn9y7	conservative	"The Harvard graduate who said in a TikTok video that she would “stab” anyone who told her “All Lives Matter” lost her job today. “The job that I’d worked really hard to get and meant a lot to me has called me and fired me"""	"The Harvard graduate who said in a TikTok video that she would “stab” anyone who told her “All Lives Matter” revealed in a new pair of recordings that she has lost her job over the perceived threats and ensuing furor.

“Standing up for Black Lives Matter put me in a place online to be seen by millions of people,” a teary Claira Janover said in a new video posted Wednesday afternoon. “The job that I’d worked really hard to get and meant a lot to me has called me and fired me because of everything.”

Janover’s LinkedIn account lists her as an “incoming government and public business service analyst” at Deloitte, a UK-based accounting firm.

During the video, Janover gestured to what appears to be a page from the company’s website, and noted that she was axed “even though they claim to stand against systematic bias, racism and unequal treatment.”

Janover — who graduated from Harvard in May with a degree in government and psychology — went viral after posting a video to the platform railing against people with “the nerve, the sheer entitled Caucasity to say ‘All Lives Matter.’”

“I’ma stab you,” the Connecticut native said in the video, zooming in tight on her face.

“I’ma stab you, and while you’re struggling and bleeding out, I’ma show you my paper cut and say, ‘My cut matters, too.'”

Janover, who contended that the message was an analogy rather than a serious threat, has since received a deluge of threats against her own life and safety.

In her new videos, she blamed supporters of President Trump for going after her job.

“Trump supporters took my job away from me,” she said in another new video posted Wednesday. “I have gotten death threats, rape threats, violent threats. It was OK, but now my future’s entirely compromised because Trump supporters have decided to come for my life.”

Through tears, a defiant Janover vowed not to back down.

“I’m too strong for you. I’m too strong for any of you ‘All Lives Matter,’ racist Trump supporters,” she said. “It sucks. But it doesn’t suck as much as systemic racism. And I’m not going to stop using my platform to advocate for it.”

She also took a parting shot at Deloitte.

“I’m sorry, Deloitte, that you can’t see that,” she said. “That you were cowardice [sic] enough to fight somebody who’s going to make an indelible change in the world and is going to have an impact.”

Deloitte did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment."	right

gyx2jw	conservative	People are calling out Terry Crews for saying that leaving white people out of conversations about race can create 'black supremacy'	"Actor Terry Crews came under fire on Sunday for tweeting about the concept of ""black supremacy.""

""Defeating white supremacy without white people creates black supremacy,"" the actor tweeted.

Twitter users were quick to point out that while Crews' tweet likely had good intentions, black supremacy does not exist in the US, and tweeting about it detracts from the messages of the Black Lives Matter movement.

Terry Crews came under fire on Sunday for a tweet he made about ""black supremacy.""

Terry Crews caught heat on Sunday night after he tweeted that ""defeating White supremacy without White people creates Black supremacy.""

The ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" actor and ""America's Got Talent"" host has been vocal in his support of the Black Lives Matter protests, and Crews was among the members of the ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" cast to donate money to bail funds for protesters.

But fans hit back at Crews' most recent tweet about racism in America.

""Defeating White supremacy without White people creates Black supremacy,"" Crews wrote in his tweet. ""Equality is the truth. Like it or not, we are all in this together.""

Although Crews appeared to be calling for unity during protests, Twitter users said his message was flawed because he compared ""black supremacy"" — an idea that can also be called reversed racism — to white supremacy.

Mic journalist Phillip Lewis explained in 2016 that black supremacy and reverse racism don't exist in the US. According to Lewis, power is integral to the existence of racism, as it creates a system in which people are at a societal disadvantage because of their race.

Historically, white people have held much of the economic and political power in the US, while laws like Jim Crow have advanced segregation and disenfranchisement of black Americans.

Reverse racism is a myth.

This power imbalance may help explain why black Americans have been impacted by police brutality at alarming rates and may account for why black Americans are being disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.

Many Twitter users pointed out that the historical suffering of black people makes Crews' statement inaccurate.

""Our people are tired of white people who put on a good face a claim they ""arnt racist"" while operating and benefiting from the privilege of a clearly racist system,"" Williams wrote. ""We're not trying to do this alone. We KNOW we can't. But we refuse to have allies who won't go the distance.""

""I understand, Tyler,"" Crews responded. ""I was not saying Black supremacy exists, because it doesn't. I am saying if both Black and Whites don't continue to work together — bad attitudes and resentments can create a dangerous self-righteousness. That's all.""

Representatives for Crews did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

Crews previously received backlash for not supporting Gabrielle Union after she reportedly spoke out against instances of racism while she was a judge at America's Got Talent in 2019.

As other celebrities voiced their support of Union, Crews stayed silent. He then went on the Today Show and said Union's experience didn't reflect his own, which many saw as him invalidating Union's testimony.

Crews apologized to Union for his statement on Twitter. He recently apologized a second time, tweeting that George Floyd's death had made him rethink his own male privilege.

""We write regarding your letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray requesting an FBI 'examination' of the social media site Parler and any role it may have played in the January 6 breach of the U.S. Capitol Building. Like you, we were disturbed and angered by the riot and we believe those responsible should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. But casting blame on a single social media company know for its conservative userbase while simply ignoring other social media companies known for sympathizing with liberal causes is blatantly and overtly partisan. Moreover, your letter is additional evidence of the growing alliance between Big Tech and Democrats to muzzle certain viewpoints, opinions, and perspectives,"" the letter states. ""Rather than limiting its investigation to Parler, then, perhaps the Committee should include Facebook and other social media companies in its request for an investigation into the antecedents of the January 6 Capitol riot.""

""Though your letter highlights several examples of disturbing, malignant posts made by extremists on Parler, it conveniently ignores messages sent on Facebook instructing people to 'seal...in' Members of Congress in the tunnels below the Capitol and to 'turn [the] gas on' -- horrendous tactics reminiscent of humanity's darkest time. In one of the only conspiracy cases charged thus far stemming from the January 6 riot, the underlying facts show weeks fusing Facebook to plan for the January 6 event,"" it continues. ""A search of Twitter immediately after the riot found that accounts related to the QAnon conspiracy theory had referred to the January 6 date roughly 20,800 times prior to the attacks...both Facebook and Twitter appear to have profited off of the January 6 riot, as 'political turmoil drives increased engagement on social media'...that generates more revenue for Facebook and Twitter.""

ku3rdi	conservative	Apple is removing Parler from the App Store	"Apple has removed Parler from the App Store, following accusations that the social media app was fostering calls to violence ahead of, and following, the raid on the US Capitol.

“We have always supported diverse points of view being represented on the App Store, but there is no place on our platform for threats of violence and illegal activity. Parler has not taken adequate measures to address the proliferation of these threats to people’s safety. We have suspended Parler from the App Store until they resolve these issues,” reads a statement from the company on Saturday evening.

Apple issued an ultimatum to Parler on Friday demanding that it remove content in violation with its policies and provide a plan on how it would moderate content moving forward, which was first reported by BuzzFeed News. Apple said Parler had 24 hours to make the changes or else it would be removed from the App Store.

Apparently, Parler did propose some changes, but Apple decided they weren’t sufficient, according to a statement Apple sent to Parler alongside its final decision to remove the app. It states that “the processes Parler has put in place to moderate or prevent the spread of dangerous and illegal content have proved insufficient,” and that Parler will not return to the App Store until it has “demonstrated your ability to effectively moderate and filter the dangerous and harmful content on your service.”

Here’s the full statement as provided by Apple:

To the developers of the Parler app, Thank you for your response regarding dangerous and harmful content on Parler. We have determined that the measures you describe are inadequate to address the proliferation of dangerous and objectionable content on your app. Parler has not upheld its commitment to moderate and remove harmful or dangerous content encouraging violence and illegal activity, and is not in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines. In your response, you referenced that Parler has been taking this content “very seriously for weeks.” However, the processes Parler has put in place to moderate or prevent the spread of dangerous and illegal content have proved insufficient. Specifically, we have continued to find direct threats of violence and calls to incite lawless action in violation of Guideline 1.1 - Safety - Objectionable Content. Your response also references a moderation plan “for the time being,” which does not meet the ongoing requirements in Guideline 1.2 - Safety - User Generated content. While there is no perfect system to prevent all dangerous or hateful user content, apps are required to have robust content moderation plans in place to proactively and effectively address these issues. A temporary “task force” is not a sufficient response given the widespread proliferation of harmful content. For these reasons, your app will be removed from the App Store until we receive an update that is compliant with the App Store Review Guidelines and you have demonstrated your ability to effectively moderate and filter the dangerous and harmful content on your service. Regards, App Review Board

The app was briefly still available on Apple’s store after we received the statement, but it disappeared from the store a number of minutes after we published this post. As TechCrunch reported earlier today, the app jumped up to #1 on the App Store and may have gained hundreds of thousands of users between the time Apple issued its 24-hour ultimatum and when the company pulled it down.

Google pulled Parler Friday evening. “We’re aware of continued posting in the Parler app that seeks to incite ongoing violence in the US,” Google said in a statement. “We recognize that there can be reasonable debate about content policies and that it can be difficult for apps to immediately remove all violative content, but for us to distribute an app through Google Play, we do require that apps implement robust moderation for egregious content. In light of this ongoing and urgent public safety threat, we are suspending the app’s listings from the Play Store until it addresses these issues.”

Both Apple and Google faced pressure on Friday to deplatform Parler, which is known for being conservative-friendly and having less stringent moderation than other social media platforms. The removal of both apps comes after a mob attack Wednesday on the US Capitol by pro-Trump rioters. On Friday, Amy Piekoff, head of policy at Parler, told Fox News a ban from the App Store would be “huge,” adding that if it Apple removed Parler “we’re toast.”

Parler did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday. CEO John Matze posted a statement on Parler accusing Apple of applying a “horrible double standard” in its decision.

“Apple, Google and the rest of the anti-competitive pack of big tech tyrants coordinate their moves and work together to stifle competition in the marketplace,” he wrote. Matze added more details would be coming soon about Parler’s plans “as we have many options.”

According to the survey, only 31 percent of voters think Pelosi should remain as Speaker of the House. 56 percent believe she shouldn’t.

President Trump never had numbers this bad — not in any reliable poll. And I’m pretty sure Majority Leader McConnell would poll considerably better than Pelosi did in the Politico/Morning Consult survey.

Throughout most of her time as Speaker, Pelosi was a gift to Republicans. With Pelosi as the villain, the GOP was able to raise massive amounts of money, energize its base, and score several impressive electoral victories.

However, things changed when Donald Trump entered office. Although probably never as unpopular as Pelosi, Trump dwarfed her on the national stage, making her seem irrelevant. This happened not just because of the office Trump held, but also because of the way he carried himself. Trump was a lightning rod.

Thus, the past two elections have been about him, not Pelosi. That’s a big reason why the same voters who would rather Pelosi not be the Speaker voted in ways that made her that.

But with Trump soon to be out of office, Pelosi will once again be front and center. If this isn’t another reason why Democrats feel gloomy about the state of play, it should be."	right

The former NFL player used his own words to caption a video of entertainer Nick Cannon spewing anti-white rhetoric, which Crews said was rooted in the kind of ideology he warned against.

“We have to include this white voice, this Hispanic voice, this Asian voice. We have to include it RIGHT NOW, because if we don’t […] it’s going to slip into something we are really not prepared for,” Crews posted, quoting himself. “Terry Crews ‘THE TALK interview’ June 16th, 2020,'” he added.

""We have to include this white voice, this Hispanic voice, this Asian voice. We have to include it RIGHT NOW, because if we don't… …it's going to slip into something we are really not prepared for."" – Terry Crews “THE TALK interview”

June 16th, 2020 https://t.co/BkC4yEmwgg — terry crews (@terrycrews) July 15, 2020

During a “Cannon’s Class” podcast that hit the internet this week, the 39-year-old former Nickelodeon star said whites are inferior to blacks, adding that white people are “savages,” the “only way that they can act is evil,” and they “have to rob, steal, rape, kill … in order to survive.”

“Melanin comes with compassion, melanin comes with soul,” Cannon said. “We call it soul. Soul brothers and sisters. That’s the melanin that connects us. So the people that don’t have it, and I’m going to say this carefully, are a little less.”

In reaction to Crews’ pointed tweet, one Twitter user told the actor “no black person” will have his back: “You going so hard against Nick Cannon, but when you fall, NO BLACK PERSON will have your back. Watch.”

“When I was young, I was never afraid of the KKK,” Crews responded. “It was people like you. The threats, the intimidation, discouraging free thought, and ‘the insult of acting white.’ My heart breaks because your behavior only reveals you don’t know how powerful you are.”

Crews has repeatedly criticized the far-left Black Lives Matter organization (which, as Crews noted, advocates for a host of left-wing causes, such as radical gender ideology and disruption of the nuclear family), mainly warning against anti-white ideology.

“Defeating White supremacy without White people creates Black supremacy,” Crews tweeted last month. “Equality is the truth. Like it or not, we are all in this together.”

The actor was swarmed with backlash from the Left over the warning.

In response, Crews posted, “I was not saying Black supremacy exists because it doesn’t. I am saying if both Black and Whites don’t continue to work together – bad attitudes and resentments can create a dangerous self-righteousness. That’s all.”

During his appearance on daytime talkshow “The Talk,” Crews reiterated his tweets and noted that he’s been shamed and called racist names like “Uncle Tom” for challenging the Left’s narrative on race as a black man.

“I’ve been called all kinds of things, like an Uncle Tom,” he said. “Simply because I’m successful, simply because I worked my way out of Flint, Michigan.”

Things really heated up when Crews appeared on CNN with host Don Lemon.

As noted by The Daily Wire, “Lemon repeatedly cut off actor Terry Crews during an interview on Monday as Crews tried to talk about the difference between saying that black lives do matter and supporting the Black Lives Matter organization, a far-left neo-Marxist group.”

""Thank you to all my friends and followers for all the prayers and kind wishes,"" Giuliani wrote. ""I’m getting great care and feeling good. Recovering quickly and keeping up with everything.""

Trump tweeted on Sunday that Giuliani had tested positive for ""the China Virus.""

The former New York City mayor has been leading the Trump campaign’s legal battle to overturn the 2020 election results in several states.

TRUMP PLANS TO OUTSHINE BIDEN ON INAUGURATION DAY

Giuliani, 76, is the latest official of Trump's orbit to become infected with the coronavirus over the course of the pandemic. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, senior adviser Hope Hicks, and chief of staff Mark Meadows are among other senior staffers who have tested positive for the virus and since recovered.

The news of Giuliani's diagnosis comes nearly two weeks after his son Andrew, also a White House staffer, tested positive for COVID-19. The senior Giuliani reportedly tested negative at the time.

Andrew confirmed the diagnosis on Twitter Sunday night, writing that his father is ""resting, getting great care and feeling well.""

An unnamed source who spoke with the New York Times said that Giuliani is reportedly undergoing treatment at the Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, D.C.

Giuliani appeared well in a ""Sunday Morning Futures"" interview where he joined host Maria Bartiromo via satellite to discuss the campaign's legal strategy. The president announced his positive diagnosis less than five hours later.

Trump campaign attorney Jenna Ellis said Sunday that the ""Trump Legal Team will continue our important work to fight for election integrity!"" She wished Giuliani a fast recovery but vowed to ""press on"" with the president's legal effort challenging the vote count in key states.

News of Giuliani's diagnosis caused the two chambers of the Arizona state legislature to suspend their work for the upcoming week, The Hill reported. Giuliani spent hours testifying in front of Republican legislators last week as part of the Trump campaign's legal effort to overturn the state’s election results.

mekrf9	conservative	Scarlett Johansson says actors should stick to acting and stop making political statements	"Hollywood actress Scarlett Johansson rejected the public compulsion to seek political statements from celebrities and said that actors should stick to acting instead.

Johansson made the comments during an interview with ""The Gentlewoman,"" a British magazine.

""I don't think actors have obligations to have a public role in society,"" said the star of the popular Avengers superhero movie franchise.

""Some people want to, but the idea that you're obligated to because you're in the public eye is unfair. You didn't choose to be a politician, you're an actor,"" she explained.

Johansson has faced her fair share of woke criticism in her career. She was accused of ""whitewashing"" in 2017 when she took on the lead role in ""Ghost In The Shell,"" a classic Japanese anime story. Later in 2018 she crossed the transgender lobby when she took the role of a transgender man in the movie, ""Rub and Tug."" She initially defended her decision but eventually withdrew from that film after public outrage.

She went on in the Gentlewoman interview to exhort other actors to stick to acting.

""Your job is to reflect our experience to ourselves; your job is to be a mirror for an audience, to be able to have an empathetic experience through art. That is what your job is,"" Johansson continued.

""Whatever my political views are, all that stuff, I feel most successful when people can sit in a theatre or at home and disappear into a story or a performance and see pieces of themselves, or are able to connect with themselves through this experience of watching this performance or story or interaction between actors or whatever it is,"" she added.

""And they're affected by it and they're thinking about it, and they feel something. You know? They have an emotional reaction to it – good, bad, uncomfortable, validating, whatever,"" Johansson explained.

""That's my job,"" she said. ""The other stuff is not my job.""

Johansson is starring in the latest Marvel superhero movie, ""Black Widow,"" which was scheduled be released in movie theaters and on Disney's streaming service on May 1, but was pushed back to July 9.

Here's the trailer from her latest movie:

lyp1y0	conservative	Enough is enough: It’s time to impose term limits on Congress	"One of the advantages of working from home during the pandemic is that it gives you the ability to watch TV while doing your work. Like many Americans, I was transfixed by the recent Trump impeachment hearings. Although I had watched events unfold on Jan. 6, leading to the awful attack on the Capitol, the frame-by-frame video presentation during the Senate trial of that assault and subsequent rioting was horrifying and disheartening.

Our work relies on the support of readers like you. Please consider supporting us at PayPal or Patreon , to help sustain our journalism.

I never would have believed that I would see such a sight in our nation’s capital. The House managers presented a cogent and overwhelmingly persuasive case that Donald Trump motivated people to come to Washington that day and incited them to march to the Capitol to do everything they could to disrupt congressional approval of the November vote by the Electoral College.

You can unsubscribe at any time.

House managers made only one mistake: They should have included a second charge that the former president was derelict in the oath he took to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. Guilt on that count would have been clear. There would have been no need to have argued the meaning and interrelation of Trump’s words at his Jan. 6 rally; there would be no doubt that he wasn’t protected by the First Amendment. It was overwhelmingly established that Trump knew of the violence and insurrection that was under way and waited a painfully long time before asking his supporters to stop their rioting.

Inside the Capitol, parts of the building were virtually torn apart and offices were ransacked. Worse, five people died in the violence perpetrated that day and 140 police officers were injured, some losing eyesight and limbs. Only by the grace of God did members of Congress, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and former Vice President Mike Pence avoid what could have been serious bodily injury or death. I will never forget how I felt when I heard the rioters chanting, “Hang Mike Pence!” and shouting, “Where is Nancy? Come out Nancy!”

There was no way even the most adept counsel could have argued that Trump’s failure to ask the rioters to stop, and his failure to immediately call out the National Guard or other reinforcements to assist the Capitol Police, were not a derelict of his constitutional duty.

The vote to acquit was shameful, but it became outright disgusting when Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other Republican senators relied on an argument that many conservative legal scholars said was hogwash — that you cannot convict a president who has left office even when he had been impeached while still serving.

Said McConnell:

“While a close call, I am persuaded that impeachments are a tool primarily of removal and we therefore lack jurisdiction. The Constitution makes perfectly clear that presidential criminal misconduct while in office can be prosecuted after the president has left office, which in my view alleviates the otherwise troubling ‘January exception’ argument raised by the House. … The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president, and having that belief was a foreseeable consequence of the growing crescendo of false statements, conspiracy theories and reckless hyperbole which the defeated president kept shouting into the largest megaphone on planet Earth. He did not do his job. He didn’t take steps so federal law could be faithfully executed and order restored.”

Okay, to Sen. McConnell and the 42 other gutless senators who voted to acquit: Enough is enough. Having run for office 11 times, I understand the fear of losing. If you want to make real changes that affect people’s lives in positive ways, and you believe you can, you don’t want to lose that opportunity. But it is apparent that a significant number of elected officials who populate Congress are so afraid of losing an election that they won’t do anything with which their constituents might disagree. They don’t act like leaders. They act like sheep waiting to be directed where to go.

Read: Without Unity, America Will Fall

This has become increasingly evident. Remember when legislation requiring a background check for a gun purchase failed in Congress even though most Americans favor the idea? Nothing seems to work with members of Congress; their fear of losing an election has become paralyzing and their ability to do anything that has the slightest opposition is almost nonexistent. Sensible term limits — six terms for House members and two terms for senators — would solve the problem. If you were a senator in your ninth year of service, the only thing you would risk in taking an unpopular vote would be an additional three years in office, not a career.

Although I admire Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) for being among the Republicans who voted to convict Trump, they did so with the freedom of having announced that they would not run for re-election. When I was governor of Pennsylvania, I proposed a tax increase to fund, in large part, early childhood education. I remember a veteran Democratic legislator saying to me: “I know you are right about kids needing early education, but I can’t vote your way because I need two more years to vest my pension and voting to raise taxes might jeopardize my reelection.”

The Framers of our Constitution contemplated that Congress would be filled with citizen soldiers, farmers, business owners, shopkeepers, accountants, lawyers and others who would come to Washington, serve for a few years, and then return to their hometowns. They never imagined that we would have members of Congress serve for decades upon decades. Congressional service has become a career and many elected officials who leave office don’t even return to their home states, choosing instead to remain in Washington. That’s no way to run the greatest legislative body in the world.

Term limits won’t be easy to impose. It will take the vote of three-fourths of state legislatures to approve a constitutional amendment (38 states). Naysayers believe that would be impossible to achieve, but I believe it could happen. The American public overwhelmingly supports term limits. For example, a recent poll in Pennsylvania showed that 79 percent of Pennsylvanians support term limits on Congress, including supermajorities of Republicans, Democrats and independents.

With such popular support, term limits could become a reality. It may be a hard-fought battle that takes a number of years, but the history of our country shows nothing worthwhile is ever achieved easily. As President John F. Kennedy said: “We choose to … do [these] things not because they are easy, but because they are hard.”

jxcf5f	conservative	Fox News’ Ratings Tank After Election Night, Down Nearly 40% | The Daily Wire	"The presidential election has been an absolute roller coaster ride—for us, for the candidates, and even for the media.

While no one was declared president on election night, the clear winner was Fox News. With 14.1 million viewers during primetime (compared to 9.4 million for CNN and 7.6 million for MSNBC), they swept the show.

Well, sort of…

Fox News did have a record night, but that’s only part of the story. The total number of viewers who tuned in over the course of the evening was 56.9 million, which is actually down 20% from the 71 million viewers who watched in 2016 and still below the 66.8 million who watched in 2012.

And that’s not the only thing that was down. After stirring controversy by calling Arizona for Biden far before any other outlet, and drawing the ire of many Trump supporters for other on-air decisions, Fox News has hemorrhaged viewers.

According to Nielsen TV ratings, several of Fox News’ core programs have shown a substantial drop in viewership since election night. Here’s the percentage of viewers each anchor lost from November 2nd to November 11th:

Neil Cavuto – 40%

Bret Baier – 40%

Martha MacCallum – 40%

Laura Ingraham – 36%

Sean Hannity – 33%

Tucker Carlson – 29%

Of course, Fox News is by no means imploding. Their year over year viewership has grown, they’ve surged among younger viewers, and they continue to lead CNN and MSNBC in primetime and both total viewers. And while certainly some of the decline could be attributed to fading interest in election coverage, the numbers show an unusually stark decline in viewership in such a short period of time. Does this prove the existence of a mass exodus of viewers away from mainstream media? Maybe. But there’s no doubt that trust in cable news coverage is only continuing to drop.

A Gallup poll shows the percentage of Americans who have a “Great deal/fair amount” of trust in mass media currently hovers around 40%. This is actually up from 2016’s all-time low of 32% but still down from the high of 45% in 2018. It’s no surprise also that the group with the lowest trust in the media was Republicans (32%).

We can debate which way the media trends all day long, but the examples of large media companies spewing one-sided propaganda are legion. The fault of the news isn’t the direction they’re trying to pull you. It’s that they’re trying to pull you at all.

The fact that viewers appear to be leaving Fox News in droves is likely a good thing. So much has been written about the media’s involvement in this year’s election results, and if that’s true, America may be better off listening to other sources.

kx8uav	conservative	Twitter, Facebook Lost $51 Billion in Market Value Since Trump Ban	"Twitter, Facebook: $51 Billion Combined Market Value Erased Since Trump Ban

Social media giants Facebook and Twitter have collectively seen $51.2 billion in combined market value wiped out over the last two trading sessions since they banned President Donald Trump from their platforms following the U.S. Capitol breach.

Large tech firms and a number of Democratic political figures have claimed Trump incited violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. The incident disrupted debates in both the House and Senate as lawmakers were forced to shelter in place while police and security attempted to regain control.

Trump took to Twitter following the outbreak of violence to call on protesters to “go home in peace.” He denounced the violence as a “heinous attack” that “defiled the seat of American democracy” on Jan. 7. It is unclear who instigated the breach of the building.

Last week, Twitter first placed restrictions on a video the president posted, then temporarily suspended his account. Facebook followed suit shortly thereafter. Twitter two days later permanently suspended Trump’s account, saying it was due to two Twitter posts having violated its policies.

A large number of pro-Trump accounts were also deleted by Twitter and Facebook.

As users attempted to flee to Parler and other social media websites, Amazon Web Services suspended its service with Parler on Jan. 11, triggering a lawsuit from the company hours later.

Most recently, Google’s YouTube removed new content from Trump’s account and suspended his channel for at least a week, saying that the channel violated its policies for “inciting violence.”

“After careful review, and in light of concerns about the ongoing potential for violence, we removed new content uploaded to the Donald J. Trump channel and issued a strike for violating our policies for inciting violence,” a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement to The Epoch Times.

“As a result, in accordance with our long-standing strikes system, the channel is now prevented from uploading new videos or livestreams for a minimum of seven days—which may be extended. We are also indefinitely disabling comments under videos on the channel, we’ve taken similar actions in the past for other cases involving safety concerns.”

Google didn’t have any further comment when asked about what aspects of the content on Trump’s channel had violated its policies.

The president has argued that companies such as Google, Twitter, and Facebook will fail due to censorship.

Big Tech is “doing a horrible thing to our country. … And I believe it’s going to be a catastrophic mistake for them,” Trump said.

lxzjv5	conservative	Dr. Suess Books to Remain on Shelves at New York Public Library: We Don’t Censor Books	"The New York Public Library is sticking by the First Amendment’s protection of free speech, even if institutions are falling in line behind the censorship of some of Theodor Geisel’s, or Dr. Seuss’s, books because they contain depictions of people that are “hurtful” and “wrong.”

“As with all public libraries the New York Public Library does not censor books,” library spokeswoman Angela Montefinise said in a New York Post report.

“In this case, the six titles in question are being pulled out of print by Dr. Seuss Enterprises, so the very few copies we have of these titles will continue to circulate until they are no longer in acceptable condition,” Montefinise said.

“In the meantime, librarians, who care deeply about serving their communities and ensuring accurate and diverse representation in our collections — especially children’s books — will certainly strongly consider this information when planning storytimes, displays, and recommendations,” she said.

The spokesperson said the books are also a part of the library’s historical research collection.

The Post reported on the iconic library and others who are not pulling books from shelves:

A spokesperson for the Brooklyn Public Library said Wednesday that the books also remain in circulation there. Officials at the Queens Public Library said they are weighing whether to move the books to its reference section but noted, “we stand firmly against censorship.” The half dozen books by Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, made news this week when the company that publishes the titles for Penguin Random House, said it would no longer publish them. The six books — “If I Ran the Zoo,” “And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street,” “McElligot’s Pool,” “On Beyond Zebra!,” “Scrambled Eggs Super!,” and “The Cat’s Quizzer” — have come under fire in recent years due to its stereotypical portrayal of different ethnic and racial groups.

The Post reported that the Denver Public Library is also keeping the six books in its collection.

jstr97	conservative	"""He plans to wreck Fox"": Trump eyes starting his own digital media empire"	"President Trump has told friends he wants to start a digital media company to clobber Fox News and undermine the conservative-friendly network, sources tell Axios.

The state of play: Some Trump advisers think Fox News made a mistake with an early call (seconded by AP) of President-elect Biden's win in Arizona. That enraged Trump, and gave him something tangible to use in his attacks on the network.

""He plans to wreck Fox. No doubt about it,"" said a source with detailed knowledge of Trump's intentions.

With loyal viewers and longtime dominance, Fox Corp. CEO Lachlan Murdoch said on a Nov. 3 earnings call:

""We love competition. We have always thrived with competition. ... Fox News has been the number one network, including broadcast networks, ... from Labor Day through to Election Day.""

Here's Trump's plan, according to the source:

There's been lots of speculation about Trump starting a cable channel. But getting carried on cable systems would be expensive and time-consuming.

Instead, Trump is considering a digital media channel that would stream online, which would be cheaper and quicker to start.

Trump's digital offering would likely charge a monthly fee to MAGA fans. Many are Fox News viewers, and he'd aim to replace the network — and the $5.99-a-month Fox Nation streaming service, which has an 85% conversion rate from free trials to paid subscribers — as their top destination.

Trump's database of email and cellphone contacts would be a huge head start.

Trump's lists are among the most valuable in politics — especially his extensive database of cellphone numbers for text messages.

Axios is told Trump may use vote-count rallies to undercut Fox.

""He's going to spend a lot of time slamming Fox,"" the source said.

Trump has increasingly complained that Fox News interviews more Democrats than it used to. He has needled the network by promoting other conservative outlets, including One America News and Newsmax."	right
invfxf	conservative	San Francisco gym owners livid after discovering gyms in government buildings have been opened for months	"Gyms within government buildings in San Francisco have been open for months, despite privately owned establishments being ordered to close due to the coronavirus.

“It’s shocking, it’s infuriating,” Daniele Rabkin, of Crossfit Golden Gate, told a local NBC station. “Even though they’re getting exposed, there are no repercussions, no ramifications? It’s shocking.”

The gyms that have been open for government employees include those for police officers, judges, lawyers, bailiffs, and paralegals, according to the report. One such gym, the Hall of Justice gym, has been open since July 1.

“It just demonstrates that there seems to be some kind of a double standard between what city employees are allowed to do and what the residents of San Francisco are allowed to do,” Dave Karraker, owner of MX3 Fitness in the Castro, said.

“What the city has unwillingly done is created this great case study that says that working out indoors is actually safe,” said Karraker. “So, at this point, we’re just demanding that they allow us to have the same workout privileges for the citizens of San Francisco that the employees of San Francisco have.”

The report comes after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was recorded in a San Francisco salon without a face mask, despite local orders mandating that such establishments be closed.

“It was a slap in the face that she went in, you know, that she feels that she can just go and get her stuff done while no one else can go in, and I can’t work,” salon owner Erica Kious told Fox News last week of Pelosi.

“We have been shut down for so long, not just me, but most of the small businesses, and I just can’t — it’s a feeling — a feeling of being deflated, helpless, and honestly, beaten down,” Kious said.

Pelosi addressed the video after it was released, calling it a “setup” and demanding an apology.

“I take responsibility for trusting the word of the neighborhood salon that I have been to many times,” Pelosi told reporters Wednesday. “When they said they could accommodate people one at a time, and we can set up that time, I trusted that.”

“As it turns out, it was a setup. So I take responsibility for falling for a setup,” she added. “The salon owes me an apology for setting me up.”"	right

'Have a Nice Life'	"Ice Cube is pushing back at critics who are “mad” that he worked with President Donald Trump’s administration on the Platinum Plan, which would create 3 million jobs for black Americans and would see $500 billion for economic, educational, and financial investments in black communities across the country.

“Let me get this straight, I get the president of the United States to agree to put over half a trillion dollars of capital in the Black Community (without an endorsement) and Niggas are mad at me?” Ice Cube said in a tweet on Thursday, adding “…have a nice life.”

Let me get this straight, I get the president of the United States to agree to put over half a trillion dollars of capital in the Black Community (without an endorsement) and Niggas are mad at me?😂😂😂…have a nice life. — Ice Cube (@icecube) November 5, 2020

The movie mogul and Big Three basketball league founder unveiled his Contract with Black America earlier this year. Last month, Ice Cube said the Biden campaign told him to wait until after the election to work with them on policy aimed at black Americans. He also said the Trump campaign reached out to him, and together they “made some adjustments” to the campaign’s “Platinum Plan.”

“Trump officials reached out to Ice Cube after he posted his Contract With Black America and incorporated some of his ideas and thoughts into the Platinum Plan,” Trump campaign senior adviser Katrina Pierson told Breitbart News, confirming Ice Cube’s claims.

The Friday and Ride Along star has faced heavy backlash, mostly on social media, for his decision to work with the Trump White House. Ice Cube has refused to back down.

“Fuck you SNL,” Ice Cube tweeted over the weekend, after the long-running NBC sketch comedy show mocked him for praising President Trump’s Platinum Plan. “Trying to reduce me to greed.”

😂😂😂…fuck you SNL…trying to reduce me to greed. https://t.co/pObFAkOvcq — Ice Cube (@icecube) November 1, 2020

Last week, Ice Cube told Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo that he likes the fact that the president’s plan ‘is aimed towards black Americans. “You know, that’s the key. I just think whatever we do got to be aimed toward black Americans.”

kvrqgt	conservative	'Our souls are dead': how I survived a Chinese 're-education' camp for Uighurs	"The man on the phone said he worked for the oil company, “In accounting, actually”. His voice was unfamiliar to me. At first, I couldn’t make sense of what he was calling about. It was November 2016, and I had been on unpaid leave from the company since I left China and moved to France 10 years earlier. There was static on the line; I had a hard time hearing him.

“You must come back to Karamay to sign documents concerning your forthcoming retirement, Madame Haitiwaji,” he said. Karamay was the city in the western Chinese province of Xinjiang where I’d worked for the oil company for more than 20 years.

“In that case, I’d like to grant power of attorney,” I said. “A friend of mine in Karamay takes care of my administrative affairs. Why should I come back for some paperwork? Why go all that way for such a trifle? Why now?”

The man had no answers for me. He simply said he would call me back in two days after looking into the possibility of letting my friend act on my behalf.

My husband, Kerim, had left Xinjiang in 2002 to look for work. He tried first in Kazakhstan, but came back disillusioned after a year. Then in Norway. Then France, where he had applied for asylum. Once he was settled there, our two girls and I would join him.

Kerim had always known he would leave Xinjiang. The idea had taken root even before we were hired by the oil company. We had met as students in Urumqi, the largest city in Xinjiang province, and, as new graduates, had begun looking for work. This was in 1988. In the job ads in the newspapers, there was often a little phrase in small print: No Uighurs. This never left him. While I tried to overlook the evidence of discrimination that followed us everywhere, with Kerim, it became an obsession.

After graduation, we were offered jobs as engineers at the oil company in Karamay. We were lucky. But then there was the red envelope episode. At lunar new year, when the boss handed out the annual bonuses, the red envelopes given to Uighur workers contained less than those given to our colleagues who belonged to China’s dominant ethnic group, the Han. Soon after, all the Uighurs were transferred out of the central office and moved to the outskirts of town. A small group objected, but I didn’t dare. A few months later, when a senior position came up, Kerim applied. He had the right qualifications and the seniority. There was no reason he shouldn’t get the position. But the post went to an employee who belonged to a Han worker who didn’t even have an engineering degree. One night in 2000, Kerim came home and announced that he had quit. “I’ve had enough,” he said.

What my husband was experiencing was all too familiar. Since 1955, when communist China annexed Xinjiang as an “autonomous region”, we Uighurs have been seen as a thorn in the side of the Middle Kingdom. Xinjiang is a strategic corridor and far too valuable for China’s ruling Communist party to risk losing control of it. The party has invested too much in the “new silk road”, the infrastructure project designed to link China to Europe via central Asia, of which our region is an important axis. Xinjiang is essential to President Xi Jinping’s great plan – that is, a peaceful Xinjiang, open for business, cleansed of its separatist tendencies and its ethnic tensions. In short, Xinjiang without Uighurs.

My daughters and I fled to France to join my husband in May 2006, just before Xinjiang entered an unprecedented period of repression. My daughters, 13 and 8 at the time, were given refugee status, as was their father. In seeking asylum, my husband had made a clean break with the past. Obtaining a French passport in effect stripped him of his Chinese nationality. For me, the prospect of turning in my passport held a terrible implication: I would never be able to return to Xinjiang. How could I ever say goodbye to my roots, to the loved ones I’d left behind – my parents, my brothers and sisters, their children? I imagined my mother, getting on in years, dying alone in her village in the northern mountains. Giving up my Chinese nationality meant giving up on her, too. I couldn’t bring myself to do it. So instead, I’d applied for a residence permit that was renewable every 10 years.

After the phone call, my head was buzzing with questions as I looked around the quiet living room of our apartment in Boulogne. Why did that man want me to go back to Karamay? Was it a ploy so the police could interrogate me? Nothing like this had happened to any of the other Uighurs I knew in France.

The man called back two days later. “Granting power of attorney will not be possible, Madame Haitiwaji. You must come to Karamay in person.” I gave in. After all, it was only a matter of a few documents.

“Fine. I’ll be there as soon as I can,” I said.

When I hung up, a shiver ran down my spine. I dreaded going back to Xinjiang. Kerim had been doing his best to reassure me for two days now, but I had a bad feeling about it. At this time of year, Karamay city was in the grip of a brutal winter. Gusts of icy wind howled down the avenues, between the shops, houses and apartment buildings. A few bundled-up figures braved the elements, hugging the walls, but on the whole, there was not a soul to be seen. But what I feared most of all were the ever-stricter measures regulating Xinjiang. Anyone who set foot outside their home could be arrested for no reason at all.

That wasn’t new, but the despotism had become more pronounced since the Urumqi riots in 2009, an explosion of violence between the city’s Uighur and Han populations, which left 197 people dead. The event marked a turning point in the recent history of the region. Later, the Chinese Communist party would blame the entire ethnic group for these horrible acts, justifying its repressive policies by claiming that Uighur households were a hotbed of radical Islam and separatism.

The summer of 2016 saw the entrance of a significant new player in the long struggle between our ethnic group and the Communist party. Chen Quanguo, who had made his reputation imposing draconian surveillance measures in Tibet, was named head of Xinjiang province. With his arrival, the repression of Uighurs escalated dramatically. Thousands were sent to “schools” built almost overnight on the edge of desert settlements. These were known as “transformation through education” camps. Detainees were sent there to be brainwashed – and worse.

I didn’t want to go back, but all the same, I decided Kerim was right: there was no reason for me to worry. The trip would only take a few weeks. “They’ll definitely pull you in for questioning, but don’t panic. That’s completely normal,” he reassured me.

A few days after I landed in China, on the morning of 30 November 2016, I went to the oil company office in Karamay to sign the vaunted documents related to my upcoming retirement. In the office with its flaking walls sat the accountant, a sour-voiced Han, and his secretary, hunched behind a screen.

The next stage took place in Kunlun police station, a 10-minute drive from the company head office. On the way, I prepared my answers to the questions I was likely to be asked. I tried to steel myself. After leaving my belongings at the front desk, I was led to a narrow, soulless room: the interrogation room. I’d never been in one before. A table separated the policemen’s two chairs from my own. The quiet hum of the heater, the poorly cleaned whiteboard, the pallid lighting: these set the scene. We discussed the reasons I left for France, my jobs at a bakery and a cafeteria in the business district of Paris, La Défense.

Then one of the officers shoved a photo under my nose. It made my blood boil. It was a face I knew as well as my own – those full cheeks, that slender nose. It was my daughter Gulhumar. She was posing in front of the Place du Trocadéro in Paris, bundled up in her black coat, the one I’d given her. In the photo, she was smiling, a miniature East Turkestan flag in her hand, a flag the Chinese government had banned. To Uighurs, that flag symbolises the region’s independence movement. The occasion was one of the demonstrations organised by the French branch of the World Uighur Congress, which represents Uighurs in exile and speaks out against Chinese repression in Xinjiang.

Whether you’re politicised or not, such gatherings in France are above all a chance for the community to get together, much like birthdays, Eid and the spring festival of Nowruz. You can go to protest repression in Xinjiang, but also, as Gulhumar did, to see friends and catch up with the community of exiles. At the time, Kerim was a frequent attender. The girls went once or twice. I never did. Politics isn’t my thing. Since leaving Xinjiang, I’d only grown less interested.

Suddenly, the officer slammed his fist on the table.

“You know her, don’t you?”

“Yes. She’s my daughter.”

“Your daughter’s a terrorist!”

“No. I don’t know why she was at that demonstration.”

I kept repeating, “I don’t know, I don’t know what she was doing there, she wasn’t doing anything wrong, I swear! My daughter is not a terrorist! Neither is my husband!”

I can’t remember the rest of the interrogation. All I remember is that photo, their aggressive questions, and my futile replies. I don’t know how long it went on for. I remember that when it was over, I said, irritably: “Can I go now? Are we done here?” Then one of them said: “No, Gulbahar Haitiwaji, we’re not done.”

‘Right! Left! At ease!” There were 40 of us in the room, all women, wearing blue pyjamas. It was a nondescript rectangular classroom. A big metal shutter, perforated with tiny holes that let the light in, hid the outside world from us. Eleven hours a day, the world was reduced to this room. Our slippers squeaked on linoleum. Two Han soldiers relentlessly kept time as we marched up and down the room. This was called “physical education”. In reality, it was tantamount to military training.

Our exhausted bodies moved through the space in unison, back and forth, side to side, corner to corner. When the soldier bellowed “At ease!” in Mandarin, our regiment of prisoners froze. He ordered us to remain still. This could last half an hour, or just as often a whole hour, or even more. When it did, our legs began to prickle all over with pins and needles. Our bodies, still warm and restless, struggled not to sway in the moist heat. We could smell our own foul breath. We were panting like cattle. Sometimes, one or another of us would faint. If she didn’t come round, a guard would yank her to her feet and slap her awake. If she collapsed again, he would drag her out of the room, and we’d never see her again. Ever. At first, this shocked me, but now I was used to it. You can get used to anything, even horror.

It was now June 2017, and I’d been here for three days. After almost five months in the Karamay police cells, between interrogations and random acts of cruelty – at one stage I was chained to my bed for 20 days as punishment, though I never knew what for – I was told I would be going to “school”. I had never heard of these mysterious schools, or the courses they offered. The government has built them to “correct” Uighurs, I was told. The women who shared my cell said it would be like a normal school, with Han teachers. She said that once we had passed, the students would be free to go home.

This “school” was in Baijiantan, a district on the outskirts of Karamay. After leaving the police cells, that was all the information I’d managed to glean, from a sign stuck in a dried ditch where a few empty plastic bags were drifting about. Apparently, the training was to last a fortnight. After that, the classes on theory would begin. I didn’t know how I was going to hold out. How had I not broken down already? Baijiantan was a no man’s land from which three buildings rose, each the size of a small airport. Beyond the barbed-wire fence, there was nothing but desert as far as the eye could see.

On my first day, female guards led me to a dormitory full of beds, mere planks of numbered wood. There was already another woman there: Nadira, Bunk No 8. I was assigned Bunk No 9.

Nadira showed me around the dormitory, which had the heady smell of fresh paint: the bucket for doing your business, which she kicked wrathfully; the window with its metal shutter always closed; the two cameras panning back and forth in high corners of the room. That was it. No mattress. No furniture. No toilet paper. No sheets. No sink. Just two of us in the gloom and the bang of heavy cell doors slamming shut.

This was no school. It was a re-education camp, with military rules, and a clear desire to break us. Silence was enforced, but, physically taxed to the limit, we no longer felt like talking anyway. Over time, our conversations dwindled. Our days were punctuated by the screech of whistles on waking, at mealtime, at bedtime. Guards always had an eye on us; there was no way to escape their watchfulness, no way to whisper, wipe your mouth, or yawn for fear of being accused of praying. It was against the rules to turn down food, for fear of being called an “Islamist terrorist”. The wardens claimed our food was halal.

At night, I collapsed on my bunk in a stupor. I had lost all sense of time. There was no clock. I guessed at the time of day from how cold or hot it felt. The guards terrified me. We hadn’t seen daylight since we arrived – all the windows were blocked by those damned metal shutters. Though one of the policemen had promised I’d be given a phone, I hadn’t been. Who knew I was being held here? Had my sister been notified, or Kerim and Gulhumar? It was a waking nightmare. Beneath the impassive gaze of the security cameras, I couldn’t even open up to my fellow detainees. I was tired, so tired. I couldn’t even think any more.

The camp was a labyrinth where guards led us around in groups by dormitory. To go to the showers, the bathroom, the classroom, or the canteen, we were escorted down a series of endless fluorescent-lit hallways. Even a moment’s privacy was impossible. At either end of the hallways, automatic security doors sealed off the maze like airlocks. One thing was for sure: everything here was new. The reek of paint from the spotless walls was a constant reminder. It seemed like the premises of a factory (I would later find out that it was a remodelled police compound), but I didn’t yet have a handle on just how big it was.

The sheer number of guards and other female prisoners we passed as we were moved around led me to believe this camp was massive. Every day, I saw new faces, zombie-like, with bags under the eyes. By the end of the first day, there had been seven of us in our cell; after three days there were 12. A little quick maths: I’ve counted 16 cell groups, including mine, each with 12 bunks, full up … that made for almost 200 detainees at Baijiantan. Two hundred women torn from their families. Two hundred lives locked up until further notice. And the camp just kept filling up.

You could tell the new arrivals from their distraught faces. They still tried to meet your eyes in the hallway. The ones who’d been there longer looked down at their feet. They shuffled around in close ranks, like robots. They snapped to attention without batting an eye, when a whistle ordered them to. Good God, what had been done to make them that way?

I’d thought the theory classes would bring us a bit of relief from the physical training, but they were even worse. The teacher was always watching us, and slapped us every chance she got. One day, one of my classmates, a woman in her 60s, shut her eyes, surely from exhaustion or fear. The teacher gave her a brutal slap. “Think I don’t see you praying? You’ll be punished!” The guards dragged her violently from the room. An hour later, she came back with something she had written: her self-criticism. The teacher made her read it out loud to us. She obeyed, ashen-faced, then sat down again. All she’d done was shut her eyes.

After a few days, I understood what people meant by “brainwashing”. Every morning, a Uighur instructor would come into our silent classroom. A woman of our own ethnicity, teaching us how to be Chinese. She treated us like wayward citizens that the party had to re-educate. I wondered what she thought of all this. Did she think anything at all? Where was she from? How had she ended up here? Had she herself been re-educated before doing this work?

At her signal, we all stood up as one. “Lao shi hao!” This greeting to the teacher kicked off 11 hours of daily teaching. We recited a kind of pledge of allegiance to China: “Thank you to our great country. Thank you to our party. Thank you to our dear President Xi Jinping.” In the evening, a similar version ended the lesson: “I wish for my great country to develop and have a bright future. I wish for all ethnicities to form a single great nation. I wish good health to President Xi Jinping. Long live President Xi Jinping.”

Glued to our chairs, we repeated our lessons like parrots. They taught us the glorious history of China – a sanitised version, cleansed of abuses. On the cover of the manual we were given was inscribed “re-education programme”. It contained nothing but stories of the powerful dynasties and their glorious conquests, and the great achievements of the Communist party. It was even more politicised and biased than the teaching at Chinese universities. In the early days, it made me laugh. Did they really think they were going to break us with a few pages of propaganda?

But as the days went by, fatigue set in like an old enemy. I was exhausted, and my firm resolve to resist was on permanent hold. I tried not to give in, but school went steamrolling on. It rolled right over our aching bodies. So this was brainwashing – whole days spent repeating the same idiotic phrases. As if that weren’t enough, we had to do an hour of extra study after dinner in the evening before going to bed. We would review our endlessly repeated lessons one last time. Every Friday, we had an oral and written test. By turns, beneath the wary eye of the camp leaders, we would recite the communist stew we’d been served up.

In this way, our short-term memory became both our greatest ally and our worst enemy. It enabled us to absorb and regurgitate volumes of history and declarations of loyal citizenship, so we could avoid the public humiliation dished out by the teacher. But at the same time, it weakened our critical abilities. It took away the memories and thoughts that bind us to life. After a while I could no longer picture clearly the faces of Kerim and my daughters. We were worked until we were nothing more than dumb animals. No one told us how long this would go on.

How even to begin the story of what I went through in Xinjiang? How to tell my loved ones that I lived at the mercy of police violence, of Uighurs like me who, because of the status their uniforms gave them, could do as they wished with us, our bodies and souls? Of men and women whose brains had been thoroughly washed – robots stripped of humanity, zealously enforcing orders, petty bureaucrats working under a system in which those who do not denounce others are themselves denounced, and those who do not punish others are themselves punished. Persuaded that we were enemies to be beaten down – traitors and terrorists – they took away our freedom. They locked us up like animals somewhere away from the rest of the world, out of time: in camps.

In the “transformation-through-education” camps, life and death do not mean the same thing as they do elsewhere. A hundred times over I thought, when the footfalls of guards woke us in the night, that our time had come to be executed. When a hand viciously pushed clippers across my skull, and other hands snatched away the tufts of hair that fell on my shoulders, I shut my eyes, blurred with tears, thinking my end was near, that I was being readied for the scaffold, the electric chair, drowning. Death lurked in every corner. When the nurses grabbed my arm to “vaccinate” me, I thought they were poisoning me. In reality, they were sterilising us. That was when I understood the method of the camps, the strategy being implemented: not to kill us in cold blood, but to make us slowly disappear. So slowly that no one would notice.

We were ordered to deny who we were. To spit on our own traditions, our beliefs. To criticise our language. To insult our own people. Women like me, who emerged from the camps, are no longer who we once were. We are shadows; our souls are dead. I was made to believe that my loved ones, my husband and my daughter, were terrorists. I was so far away, so alone, so exhausted and alienated, that I almost ended up believing it. My husband, Kerim, my daughters Gulhumar and Gulnigar – I denounced your “crimes”. I begged forgiveness from the Communist party for atrocities that neither you nor I committed. I regret everything I said that dishonoured you. Today I am alive, and I want to proclaim the truth. I don’t know if you will accept me, I don’t know if you’ll forgive me.

How can I begin to tell you what happened here?

I was held in Baijiantan for two years. During that time, everyone around me – the police officers who came to interrogate prisoners, plus the guards, teachers and tutors – tried to make me believe the massive lie without which China could not have justified its re-education project: that Uighurs are terrorists, and thus that I, Gulbahar, as a Uighur who had been living in exile in France for 10 years, was a terrorist. Wave after wave of propaganda crashed down upon me, and as the months went by, I began to lose part of my sanity. Bits of my soul shattered and broke off. I will never recover them.

During violent interrogations by the police, I kowtowed under the blows – so much so that I even made false confessions. They managed to convince me that the sooner I owned up to my crimes, the sooner I’d be able to leave. Exhausted, I finally gave in. I had no other choice. No one can fight against themselves for ever. No matter how tirelessly you battle brainwashing, it does its insidious work. All desire and passion desert you. What options do you have left? A slow, painful descent into death, or submission. If you play at submission, if you feign losing your psychological power struggle against the police, then at least, despite it all, you hang on to the shard of lucidity that reminds you who you are.

I didn’t believe a word of what I was saying to them. I simply did my best to be a good actor.

On 2 August 2019, after a short trial, before an audience of just a few people, a judge from Karamay pronounced me innocent. I barely heard his words. I listened to the sentence as if it were nothing to do with me. I was thinking about all the times I had asserted my innocence, all those nights I had tossed and turned on my bunk, enraged that no one would believe me. And I was thinking about all those other times when I had admitted the things they accused me of, all the fake confessions I had made, all those lies.

They had sentenced me to seven years of re-education. They had tortured my body and brought my mind to the edge of madness. And now, after reviewing my case, a judge had decided that no, in actual fact, I was innocent. I was free to go.

irdc0y	conservative	Tulsi Gabbard Condemns Netflix for Releasing 'Cuties': 'Child Porn' That 'Will Whet the Appetite of Pedophiles & Fuel Child Sex Trafficking'	"Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) is condemning Netflix for releasing the controversial Cuties, calling the movie “child porn” and telling the streamer that it is “complicit” in encouraging pedophiles and helping to fuel the child sex trafficking trade. Her condemnation adds to the growing Congressional scrutiny of Netflix over its decision to distribute the sexually charged movie.

In a blistering tweet posted late Friday, the former Democratic presidential candidate blasted Netflix, citing the fact that 1 in 4 victims of sex trafficking are children.

“Child porn Cuties will certainly whet the appetite of pedophiles & help fuel the child sex trafficking trade,” Gabbard wrote. “1 in 4 victims of trafficking are children. It happened to my friend’s 13 year old daughter. Netflix, you are now complicit.”

The congresswoman also used the hashtag #CancelNetflix.

Rep. Gabbard added that trafficking isn’t taken seriously enough. “Most people think it’s not a serious issue or that it just happens to some people in other places. It is rampant and happening in our own communities,” she tweeted.

I agree. Most people think it's not a serious issue or that it just happens to some people in other places. It is rampant and happening in our own communities. — Tulsi Gabbard 🌺 (@TulsiGabbard) September 12, 2020

She also tweeted that she has cancelled her Netflix subscription.

Me too. — Tulsi Gabbard 🌺 (@TulsiGabbard) September 12, 2020

Cuties, which was released this week on the streaming service, tells the story of an 11-year-old French girl who joins a twerking troupe as a way to find freedom from her oppressive Senegalese Muslim family. The movie features an extended dance sequence showing the underage girls gyrating erotically on stage while performing simulated masturbation.

Netflix has defended the movie, saying in a statement Thursday that the movie provides “social commentary against the sexualization of young children.” The streamer has previously apologized for the movie’s trailer and poster, which highlighted moments from the lewd dance sequence.

Rep. Gabbard is the first Congressional Democrat to speak out against Cuties. Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) have sent separate letters to Netflix demanding that the streamer explain why it chose to release the movie.

l1dlf1	conservative	QAnon Is Destroying the GOP From Within	"Eugene Goodman is an American hero. At a pivotal moment on January 6, the veteran United States Capitol Police officer single-handedly prevented untold bloodshed. Staring down an angry, advancing mob, he retreated up a marble staircase, calmly wielding his baton to delay his pursuers while calling out their position to his fellow officers. At the top of the steps, still alone and standing just a few yards from the chamber where senators and Vice President Mike Pence had been certifying the Electoral College’s vote, Goodman strategically lured dozens of the mayhem-minded away from an unguarded door to the Senate floor.

The leader of that flank of the mob, later identified by the FBI as Douglas Jensen, wore a T-shirt emblazoned with a red-white-and-blue Q—the insignia of the delusional QAnon conspiracy theory. Its supporters believe that a righteous Donald Trump is leading them in a historic quest to expose the U.S. government’s capture by a global network of cannibalistic pedophiles: not just “deep state” actors in the intelligence community, but Chief Justice John Roberts and a dozen-plus senators, including me. Now Trump’s own vice president is supposedly in on it, too. According to the FBI, Jensen “wanted to have his T-shirt seen on video so that ‘Q’ could ‘get the credit.’”

January 6 is a new red-letter day in U.S. history, not just because it was the first time that the Capitol had been ransacked since the War of 1812, but because a subset of the invaders apparently were attempting to disrupt a constitutionally mandated meeting of Congress, kidnap the vice president, and somehow force him to declare Trump the victor in an election he lost. En route, the mob ultimately injured scores of law-enforcement officers. The attack led to the deaths of two officers and four other Americans. But the toll could have been much worse: Police located pipe bombs at the headquarters of both the Republican and Democratic National Committees. Investigators discovered a vehicle fully loaded with weaponry and what prosecutors are calling“homemade napalm bombs.”

The violence that Americans witnessed—and that might recur in the coming days—is not a protest gone awry or the work of “a few bad apples.” It is the blossoming of a rotten seed that took root in the Republican Party some time ago and has been nourished by treachery, poor political judgment, and cowardice. When Trump leaves office, my party faces a choice: We can dedicate ourselves to defending the Constitution and perpetuating our best American institutions and traditions, or we can be a party of conspiracy theories, cable-news fantasies, and the ruin that comes with them. We can be the party of Eisenhower, or the party of the conspiracist Alex Jones. We can applaud Officer Goodman or side with the mob he outwitted. We cannot do both.

If and when the House sends its article of impeachment against Trump to the Senate, I will be a juror in his trial, and thus what I can say in advance is limited. But no matter what happens in that trial, the Republican Party faces a separate reckoning. Until last week, many party leaders and consultants thought they could preach the Constitution while winking at QAnon. They can’t. The GOP must reject conspiracy theories or be consumed by them. Now is the time to decide what this party is about.

The newly elected Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs. She once ranted that “there’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles out, and I think we have the president to do it.” During her campaign, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy had a choice: disavow her campaign and potentially lose a Republican seat, or welcome her into his caucus and try to keep a lid on her ludicrous ideas. McCarthy failed the leadership test and sat on the sidelines. Now in Congress, Greene isn’t going to just back McCarthy as leader and stay quiet. She’s already announced plans to try to impeach Joe Biden on his first full day as president. She’ll keep making fools out of herself, her constituents, and the Republican Party.

If the GOP is to have a future outside the fever dreams of internet trolls, we have to call out falsehoods and conspiracy theories unequivocally. We have to repudiate people who peddle those lies.

We also have to show a healthier path forward. The frustrations that caused so many people to turn in desperate directions for a political voice are not going away when Trump leaves the White House for Mar-a-Lago, because deception and demagoguery are the inevitable consequences of a politics that is profoundly, systemically dysfunctional. We must begin by asking how we got to such a discontented place, where we are mired in lies, rage, and now violence. In this essay, I am focusing on the maladies of the right, but Americans across the political spectrum are falling prey to the siren song of conspiracism. Here are three reasons.

America’s junk-food media diet

The way Americans are consuming and producing news—or what passes for it these days—is driving us mad. This has been said many times, but the problem has worsened in the past five years. On the supply side, media outlets have discovered that dialing up the rhetoric increases clicks, eyeballs, and revenue. On the demand side, readers and viewers like to see their opinions affirmed, rather than challenged. When everybody’s outraged, everybody wins—at least in the short term.

This is not a problem only on the right or only on obscure blogs. The underlying economics that drive Fox News and upstarts such as One America News to cultivate and serve ideologically distinct audiences also drive MSNBC, CNN, and The New York Times. More and more fiercely, media outlets rally their audience behind the latest cause du jour, whether it’s battling supposed election fraud or abolishing local police departments.

The conservative swaths of this media landscape were primed for Trump’s “Stop the steal” lie, which lit the fuse for the January 6 riot. For nine weeks, the president consistently lied that he had “won in a landslide.” Despite the fact that his lawyers and allies were laughed out of court more than 60 times, he spread one conspiracy theory after another across television, radio, and the web. For anyone who wanted to hear that Trump won, a machine of grifters was turning clicks into cash by telling their audiences what they wanted to hear. The liars got rich, their marks got angry, and things got out of control.

America’s institutional collapse

Traditional media outlets are only some of the long-standing institutions collapsing as the digital revolution erodes geographic communities in favor of placeless ones. Many people who yell at strangers on Twitter don’t know their own local officials or even their neighbors across the street. The loss of rootedness and institutional authority has created an opening for populists on the right and the left. It’s not a coincidence that in 2016, millions of Republicans threw in their lot behind a man who for almost all of his life had been a Democratic voter and donor, and millions of Democrats wanted as their nominee a senator who staunchly refused to join their party. On both sides, conventional politicians were being told they had lost the thread.

The anger being directed today at major internet platforms—Twitter, Facebook, and Google, especially—is, in part, a consequence of the fading of traditional political authority. Sometimes intentionally, sometimes inadvertently, Americans have outsourced key parts of political life to Silicon Valley behemoths that were not designed to, and are not competent to, execute functions traditionally in the province of the government. The failure of our traditional political institutions and our traditional media to function as spaces for genuine political conversation has created a vacuum now filled by the social-media giants—who are even worse at the job.

Civic authority has ebbed in other ways. Political incompetence and malpractice around the COVID-19 pandemic have only deepened suspicions that some politicians will never let a crisis go to waste. The decisions in California to keep churches closed but to keep open strip clubs and marijuana dispensaries baffle Main Street. Similarly, the jolting juxtaposition of a media-addict mayor breaking up Hasidic funerals while marching in Black Lives Matter protests not only deepens the cynicism of many Americans, but it indisputably undermined institutions of public health that should have been cautiously protecting their standing.

America’s loss of meaning

Our political sickness has a third cause. At least since World War II, sociologists and political scientists have been tracing the erosion of the institutions and habits that joined neighbors together in bonds of friendship and mutual responsibility. Little Leagues were not just pastimes; soup kitchens were not just service organizations; they were also venues in which people found shared purpose. Today, in many places, those bonds have been severed.

In 1922, G. K. Chesterton called America “a nation with the soul of a church.” But according to a recent study of dozens of countries, none has ditched religious belief faster since 2007 than the U.S. Without going into the causes, we can at least acknowledge one cost: For generations, most Americans understood themselves as children of a loving God, and all had a role to play in loving their neighbors. But today, many Americans have no role in any common story.

Conspiracy theories are a substitute. Support Donald Trump and you are not merely participating in a mundane political process—that’s boring. Rather, you are waging war on a global sex-trafficking conspiracy! No one should be surprised that QAnon has found a partner in the empty, hypocritical, made-for-TV deviant strain of evangelicalism that runs on dopey apocalypse-mongering. (I still consider myself an evangelical, even though so many of my nominal co-religionists have emptied the term of all historic and theological meaning.) A conspiracy theory offers its devotees a way of inserting themselves into a cosmic battle pitting good against evil. This sense of vocation that makes it dangerous is also precisely what makes it attractive in our era of isolated, alienated consumerism.

Whatever the Republican Party does, it faces an ugly fight. The fracture that so many politicians on the right have been trying desperately to avoid may soon happen. But if the party has any hope of playing a constructive, rather than destructive, part in America’s future, it must do two things.

First, Republicans must repudiate the nonsense that has set our party on fire. Putting it out will take courage—and I don’t mean merely political courage. This week, after realizing that some Capitol insurrectionists wanted to capture the vice president, several Republican House members said privately that they believed a vote to impeach the president would put their lives, or the lives of their families, at risk. That is not the “constituent engagement” that elected officials are duty-bound to deal with on a daily basis. That is simply tyranny, just from the bottom up, instead of the top down. When arsonists are inside our house, can we just stand by and hope that they’ll depart quietly?

Second, the party has to rebuild itself. It must offer a genuine answer to the frustrations of the past decade. Other than by indulging Trump’s fantasies about building iPhones in America, Republicans have not figured out how to address Americans’ anger about community erosion, massive dislocations in the labor force, or Big Tech’s historically unprecedented role in governing de facto public squares.

Sensing a chance at tribal expansion, some on the left are thrilled by the chaos on the right, and they’re eager to seize the moment to banish from polite society not just those who participated and encouraged violence, but anyone with an R next to his or her name. Already on Twitter, a conservative position as long-standing as opposition to abortion has been recast as “domestic terrorism.” An MSNBC host talked about the “de-Baathification” of the GOP, comparing rank-and-file Republicans to supporters of Saddam Hussein. In an exchange on CNN, a host accused Republican voters of making common cause with Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan. Yet the exploitative overreaction by the left should not allow an underreaction by the right.

The past four years have wounded our country in grievous, long-lasting ways. The mob that rushed the Capitol had been fed a steady diet of lies and conspiracy theories. It is very possible that the QAnon devotee Douglas Jensen believed the junk he’d been sold—that he was a valued foot soldier in Trump’s war against shadowy forces of darkness. So, according to the FBI, he put on his Q T-shirt and acted like a foot soldier. Right up until he ran into Officer Goodman.

In a standoff between the Constitution and madness, both men picked a side. It’s the GOP’s turn to do the same.

The tweets seem to have been prompted by a recent change to Facebook’s privacy policy. As reported by The Hacker News, the new updates allow more sharing of data between Facebook and its partner company WhatsApp, including the sharing of phone numbers, interactions on the platform, information about mobile devices used to access the service, and IP addresses. If WhatsApp users do not agree to the data sharing, their accounts are disabled.

Musk has been vocally critical of Facebook in the past, saying that he chose to delete Facebook accounts for SpaceX and Tesla in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. He has also had spats with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally, the two of them having sniped at each other over Twitter and other social media platforms several times in the past.

Facebook’s series of privacy issues has lead to increasing criticism of the company, including from prominent figures in the tech sphere. The app Musk suggested people use instead, Signal, is an encrypted messaging app that is more of an alternative to WhatsApp than to Facebook. It is for sharing messages securely between users or groups rather than a public social network.

As messages sent on Signal are encrypted, they remain private even if someone’s phone is stolen or confiscated by the police. This has made it popular among those organizing demonstrations such as the Black Lives Matter protests following the murder of George Floyd by police last summer.

However, Signal has not been without its security issues. A vulnerability in the app discovered last year could have allowed hackers to track users’ locations just by calling their Signal phone number, even if the hacker didn’t have the user’s contact information. The vulnerability was patched but did lead to concerns over how much users could trust the app to be secure.

If you want to learn more about Signal, we have details on what it is and how to use it, and we named it one of the best encrypted messaging apps for iOS and Android.

khsg4x	conservative	Newsmax Airs Clarification Of Election Fraud Claims After Legal Threat	"Newsmax on Monday followed Fox News in running an extensive fact check of claims of election rigging against President Donald Trump, after one of the targets of the conspiracy theories, election tech company Smartmatic, threatened legal action.

Smartmatic has fired off legal threats to Fox News, Newsmax and One America News Network, demanding repeated retractions after on-air personalities and guests floated claims that its election software was rigged, that it had ties to the Venezuelan government and George Soros. In fact, Smartmatic said that it provided support only for one locality in the recent presidential election, Los Angeles County.

Another company, Dominion Voting Systems, has issued lengthy rebuttals in response to disinformation, and has also issued legal demands to Sidney Powell, a Newsmax guest who has represented the Trump campaign in its legal challenges.

Newsmax’s John Tabacco read a statement on air, telling the audience that “Newsmax would like to clarify its news coverage and note that it has not reported as true certain claims made about these companies. There are several facts our viewers and readers should be aware of. Newsmax has found no evidence either Dominion or Smartmatic owns the other, or has any business association with each other.”

The statement refuted a list of claims that had been made on air since the election. Newsmax has seen a spike in ratings as it on-air figures have pushed Trump’s claims that the election was stolen from him.

Tabacco went on to say that “no evidence has been offered that Dominion or Smartmatic used software or reprogrammed software that manipulated votes in the 2020 election.”

“Dominion has stated its company has no ownership, relationship with the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s family, Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s family, the Clinton family, Hugo Chavez, or the government of Venezuela.

“Neither Dominion nor Smartmatic has any relationship with George Soros.

“Smartmatic is a U.S. company and not owned by the Venezuelan government, Hugo Chavez or any foreign official or entity.”

Newsmax also posted the statement to its website.

lidkoi	conservative	North Dakota House passes bill banning trans athletes from competing on school sports teams of their preferred gender identity	"North Dakota's state House of Representatives passed a bill on Thursday banning student athletes from participating on sports teams based on their preferred gender identity.

The bill, HB 1298, passed the state's lower chamber with a vote of 65-26.

The bill will now move to the state's Senate for consideration.

What are the details?

North Dakota state Rep. Ben Koppelman (R), who sponsored the bill, argued, ""Some have said this bill just doesn't follow the science. We've got science going back well before the United States that backs this. This isn't new science. Men and women didn't just cease to exist. They've existed for a long time, and we've been able to recognize the differences.""

North Dakota state Rep. Kathy Skroch (R), who co-sponsored the bill, told Grand Forks Herald that the bill is important for protecting the integrity of girls' and women's sports.

""This is about girls competing with girls, ensuring equal opportunity, and keeping a level playing field in girls' sports,"" Skroch said. ""It upholds 50 years of progress and protecting women against discrimination and advocates for the preservation of biological standards.""

North Dakota state House Minority Leader Josh Boschee (D) said that the bill will disappoint kids.

""It's about learning about yourself, being part of a team, solving problems, figuring out life,"" Boschee said. ""But we're gonna tell some kids you can't. ... And even though most of those kids aren't gonna go up for high school athletics because it's not within their skillset or desirability, they're gonna see the action made by this body and it's going to play into some unfortunate other decisions that they'll make.""

North Dakota state Rep. Greg Westlind (R) told KYFR-TV that he has concerns about the bill potentially opening the door for potential litigation and more.

Similar bills are progressing through approximately 12 other state governments across the country.

HB 1298 also bans sporting events from receiving public funding if they allow trans athletes to play on a team based on their preferred gender identity.

ktf7yo	conservative	FBI Says There Is ‘No Indication’ That Antifa Took Part in U.S. Capitol Riot	"The FBI said Friday that there was no indication that individuals associated with antifa disguised themselves among pro-Trump supporters in order to provoke the mob at the U.S. Capitol.

Earlier this week, Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz, Mo Brooks and Paul Gosar had suggested that the left-wing extremist group tried to frame Trump supporters.

WASHINGTON — The FBI said Friday that there was no indication that individuals associated with antifa disguised themselves as pro-Trump supporters in order to provoke the mob at the U.S. Capitol, a claim repeated by several Republican lawmakers.

When asked if the FBI had uncovered such efforts, Assistant Director Steven D'Antuono told reporters on a call, ""We have no indication of that, at this time.""

Earlier this week, Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz of Florida, Mo Brooks of Alabama and Paul Gosar of Arizona suggested that the left-wing extremist group tried to frame Trump supporters by intensifying the events that unfolded at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday after President Donald Trump's ""Save America"" rally.

Hours after the crowd descended on the Capitol in an effort to derail congressional proceedings to tally electors' votes and confirm Biden's win in the Nov. 3 election, Gaetz told the House floor that he had read ""compelling evidence"" that some of the rioters were from antifa.

""The Washington Times has just reported some pretty compelling evidence from a facial recognition company showing that some of the people who breached the Capitol today were not Trump supporters, they were masquerading as Trump supporters and in fact were members of the violent terrorist group Antifa,"" Gaetz said.

The Washington Times article has since been removed from the publication's website.

In a four-part tweet on Thursday, Brooks wrote that ""evidence growing that fascist ANTIFA orchestrated Capitol attack.""

""Evidence, much public, surfacing that many Capitol assaulters were fascist ANTIFAs, not Trump supporters,"" Brooks wrote.

Please, don’t be like #FakeNewsMedia, don’t rush to judgment on assault on Capitol. Wait for investigation. All may not be (and likely is not) what appears. Evidence growing that fascist ANTIFA orchestrated Capitol attack with clever mob control tactics.



Evidence follows: — Mo Brooks (@RepMoBrooks) January 7, 2021

jp8diz	conservative	Trump Campaign Says It Has Evidence of Voter Fraud — It's Time to Put up or Shut Up	"The Decision Desk HQ (prematurely) called the 2020 presidential election for Joe Biden on Friday. The Trump campaign is alleging all kinds of voter fraud, but short of some bad behavior, like messing with poll watchers and telling them where they can stand, we haven’t seen any hard evidence. We sure feel like we know what happened here and it would be nice to have the proof. But proof is hard to come by when it’s election fraud.

Once the mail-in and absentee ballots are separated from their envelopes, there’s no way to know where they came from. Voter fraud has been happening for a very long time, but it’s not “widespread.” Texas got all its 11 million votes counted and its returns submitted with no problems whatsoever. So did most of the country. What we do have is a system that ensures people who want to cheat can do it rather easily while there’s no proof it was done. It’s genius.

We’ve confused our voting system so badly with early voting and several different ways to vote (computer, ballot harvesting, paper ballot, punch cards, mail-in) that there is ample opportunity for individual counties in important swing states to increase the number of votes substantially without anyone knowing or being able to prove it.

But Trump should have seen this coming. We’ve been watching the blatant irregularities for years. Remember Brenda Snipes in Broward County? The Sun Sentinal does. You only need a few precincts like this to sway an election your way. It doesn’t have to be widespread. We can identify the worst suspects right now: Clark County, Nev., Broward County, Fla. (which was not a problem this year but should still be audited), Cook County, Ill., Detroit, Mich., Phoenix, Ariz., and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I may have missed a couple but off the top of my head, those are places we know have had problems in the past but no one ever does anything about it.

The fake news Word of the Day Is ""widespread,"" as in ""There is no evidence of WIDESPREAD fraud."" (Fraud only needed to happen in a few places to matter.) — Scott Adams (@ScottAdamsSays) November 6, 2020

And the main reason no one ever does anything is that voter fraud is really hard to prove. We all see the secretive and weird behavior of ballot counters, we question where all these new ballots are coming from days after the election when the whole damn country has already turned in all their votes, we see poll watchers being thrown out of polling places, but nothing is ever done. None of these places are ever investigated. Congress has made no laws strengthening our election process. If you know this is happening but you do nothing about it, how am I supposed to be upset for you? There’s no excuse. Our election process hasn’t been reformed in all these many years that this has been going on. Our leaders must want it like this and I’m including the GOP. They had control of the House and the Senate in the ’90s and could have fixed this. They didn’t. They did nothing.

Uncover it now, today or this thing is over. If there is proof then show it and do it fast. You have every network calling you a liar because you aren't showing the evidence. Put it up or this thing is over. https://t.co/5GlSDGQlbn — Megan Fox (@MeganFoxWriter) November 6, 2020

If the Trump campaign does not have hard evidence they can kiss it goodbye. What are they waiting for if they have it: Biden’s second term? If you have it, release it and let’s get this sorted out. But if there is no evidence, you just got rolled by the Democrats…knowing they would do this. Winners get evidence. And frankly, if Republicans are too stupid to have set up safeguards, put insiders in these places, or had any plan to stop the usual shenanigans then they deserve to lose.

All I’ve seen so far are irregularities and bad behavior. I can’t determine what happened or if anything can be done about it now. No one is going to care about it except Republicans. There are some things that can and should be litigated such as a judge allowing votes to be counted for three more days in Pennsylvania when the legislature is supposed to legislate election law but the courts decided to do it for them. But is that fraud? Or is that just another blow to our election processes, like early voting and not verifying voters with photo ID, both of which were done through legal means? Court decisions are the definition of legal means. (That’s not to say courts can’t act illegally and that’s why it can and will be litigated.)

Any place where vote tallies are within the margin for a recount should be recounted. We should use all available means to make sure that the votes were legally cast. But I don’t like hearing Trump and his campaign shouting “fraud” from the rooftops without providing the evidence.

Also, videos of random election place activities are not evidence of fraud. Yes, it appears that some people are sitting at a table and filling out ballots. But we don’t know what they are doing. They could be duplicating damaged ballots or those might not even be ballots. So if someone is going to allege that they were filling out ballots illegally, then show the evidence. I’m getting increasingly annoyed by the minute that the Trump campaign is not coming out with substantial evidence to shut up Brian Williams, who is repeatedly calling Trump a liar, as are all the other news media people like Jim Acosta.

If you could shut this down with evidence you would, wouldn’t you? What are you waiting for? I don’t doubt that fraud happened in this election as it does in every election. But without proof, it won’t matter.

MSNBC is the first network to pull away from Trump's speech after he says ""if you count the legal votes, I easily win."" Brian Williams: ""There are no illegal votes that we know of. There has been no Trump victory that we know of."" pic.twitter.com/SNZHlR8VFJ — Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona) November 5, 2020

The game the media and Democrats are playing is working. They aren’t wrong to demand evidence of voter fraud if that’s what you are alleging. Rumors and unexplained videos aren’t going to cut it. The media will not report any credible allegations of fraud even if it exists. They’re going to continue denying it until enough people in the country believe them. The media have proven they can suppress valid stories even when there is a mountain of evidence showing their veracity, such as the Hunter Biden laptop story, or they can amplify any fake stories such as the “Fine People Hoax” and make you believe it’s true. They own the narrative. It’s going to take some kind of nuclear bomb of evidence to break that hold. A fight between poll watchers and poll workers in one precinct isn’t going to be that bomb.

I strongly encourage the GOP to come out with their dossier showing the evidence that there was election fraud. Without that, this thing is over and we should move forward without putting the country through more agony. And no matter what outcome we have here, we need to address the failings in our voting system immediately and without delay or there will be no point in ever voting in such an illegitimate system again."	right

MONTPELIER, VT—In an address from one of his homes, Bernie Sanders condemned BLM co-founder Patrisse Cullors for getting rich off politics and buying four homes.

After it came out that the co-founder of the movement had purchased multiple large homes, Sanders quickly held a press conference condemning her ""callous and unfair profiteering.""

""No one in politics should be able to profit off their followers and buy four homes,"" Sanders said as he looked out at the quaint Vermont lake near one of his many, many houses. ""Four homes? That's ridiculous. Who needs four homes!? No one, that's who. Three homes, now, fine, you might have an argument. I could see needing a home near your office, a home in your hometown, and maybe a quiet retreat up in the mountains. Near a lake perhaps. That makes sense. Any politician could use three houses. You're practically still poor at that point.""

""But four? People who own four homes are the problem with this country.""

Sanders then said he was proposing legislation that anyone who owns four homes be banished to Toledo, Ohio for the rest of their days, while people who own just three homes have statues erected in their honor for their brave fight against capitalism and injustice.

kv34ok	conservative	70TB of Parler users’ data leaked by security researchers	"Parler, a social network used to plan the storming of the U.S. Capitol last week, has been hit by a massive data scrape. Security researchers collected swaths of user data before the network went dark Monday morning after Amazon, Google, and Apple booted the platform.

The scrape includes user profile data, user information, and which users had administration rights for specific groups within the social network. Twitter user @donk_enby, who first announced about the scrape, claims that over a million video URLs, some deleted and private, were taken.

“These are original, unprocessed, raw files as uploaded to Parler with all associated metadata,” claims one of the authors.

Security researchers claim that the scraped posts are linked to accounts that posted them, and some of the video and image data have geolocation information. That is said also to include data from Parler’s “Verified Citizens,” users of the network who verified their identity by uploading photographs of government-issued IDs, such as a driver’s license.

However, after the news about the data scrape went global, the author of the hack @donk_enby explained in a tweet that neither her nor others have collected any personal data that Parler users did not make public themselves.

CyberNews pro tip Each year, billions of personal data records are leaked or stolen. Learn how to minimize your footprint on the internet and stay secure.

Protect your data now

“Only things that were available publicly via the web were archived. I don’t have you e-mail address, phone or credit card number. unless you posted it yourself on Parler,” she stated on Twitter.

The data might prove valuable to law enforcement since many who participated in the riots deleted their posts and videos afterward. The data scrape includes deleted posts, meaning that Parler stored user data after users deleted it.

Parler, a far-right friendly site, was among the key candidates to host President Donald Trump’s social media presence as Twitter and Facebook suspended his accounts for instigating violence.

Parler, which claims to have over 10 million users, has lax rules over content, making the platform very attractive to far-right groups. Google and Apple removed Parler’s smartphone app from their app stores, claiming that the platform allowed posting that seeks to “incite ongoing violence in the U.S..” Amazon took similar measures, removing Parler from its hosting service.

Reddit users claim that the scrape was made possible due Twilio, an American cloud communications platform that provided the platform with phone number verification services, cutting ties with Parler.

In a press release announcing the decision, Twilio revealed which services Parler was using. This information allowed hackers to deduce that it was possible to create users and verified accounts without actual verification.

With this type of access, newly minted users were able to get behind the login box API used for content delivery. That allowed them to see which users had moderator rights and this in turn allowed them to reset passwords of existing users with simple “forgot password” function. Since Twilio no longer authenticated emails, hackers were able to access admin accounts with ease.

Twilio, however, distanced themselves from the accusations on revealing information about Parler’s services in a press release. The company’s head of corporate communications, Cris Paden, reached out to CyberNews in an article comment claiming that Twilio’s security experts found no evidence that Parlers’ security issues were related to their services.

“On Friday, January 8th, we sent Parler a letter informing them they were in violation of our Acceptable Use Policy and notifying them that we would suspend their account if they did not make efforts to remediate multiple calls for violence on their platform,” Mr. Paden explained in a comment.

He claims that shortly after, Parler informed the company they had already turned off their navigation with Twilio and therefore any security issues were unrelated to Twilio.

How was the scrape done?

First and foremost, the Parler data scrape was not a hack in the conventional sense. According to Matt Warner, CTO at Blumira, a cybersecurity provider of automated threat detection and response technology, recent events could be considered a significant “hacktivism movement.”

“There has not been any proof that Parler itself was “hacked,” but rather, the platform was inherently insecure and was leveraged in a group effort before being taken down,” he explained.

His team estimates that at least 15 offensive parties took part in the data scrape, and hackers collected at least 60 terabytes of data. The breach itself can be attributed to poor engineering and lack of testing on the Parler’s side that allowed a mass collection of archived data.

“This was due to an unprotected API call that was sequentially numbered, therefore allowing any attacker to iterate continuously over the endpoint and take all information available,” Mr. Warner explained.

There has not been any proof that Parler itself was “hacked,” but rather, the platform was inherently insecure and was leveraged in a group effort before being taken down, Matt Warner.

The CTO noted that Twilio’s move to pull out allowed potential users to create Parler accounts without verifying their email. According to him, Parler allowed for an IDOR attach, which enumerates across all data available.

“In the case of Parler, this was URLs that looked like https://par.pw/v1/photo?id= and the ID could be sequentially increased to gather information from the API without direct knowledge,” he explained.

A question of ethics

Even though the stated purpose of the data scrape is to keep proof of wrongdoing, a question remains: do the ends justify the means?



On the one hand, some of the people whose data got scraped actively planned acts of violence. On the other, some people joined Parler only out of curiosity or professional obligation, such as journalists. However, the data scrape was universal, without hackers paying attention to the real intentions of account holders.

“From what I‘m reading, these weren‘t hacking in a sense we think about state-sponsored hacking, involving phishing or active deception, or anything like that. There was a glaring gap in the security of the platform, and @donk_enby and a few others noticed it and used it,” Ali Alkhatib, data ethicist and a research fellow at the Center for Applied Data Ethics, explained to CyberNews.

Since @donk_enby did not carry out the data scrape secretively, there’s little to worry about from an ethics perspective. However, Alkhatib agrees that if the data scrape was targeted towards minority groups, there’d be a lot more to worry about.

“To me, this is a little more like the Ashley Madison debacle, but for white supremacists,” he explained.

Afraid your online presence was compromised? Check if your data has been leaked.

kkknds	conservative	Instead of opposing marijuana legalization Republicans should have pushed for a free market in weed	"When the effort to legalize marijuana in New Jersey passed the state Senate last week it did so without Republican votes.

Aren’t Republicans supposed to believe in free markets?

I fear the Grand Old Party is a bit confused on this issue.

The confusion traces back to the Reagan administration. Back then, the government made great efforts to crack down on the black market in marijuana.

But at the same time the administration was attacking the socialist governments of places like Cuba and Nicaragua for their insistence on shutting down their own black markets, often in necessities such as food and clothing. Consider this passage from a 1985 New York Times article:

“Even as the guerrilla war on Nicaragua’s borders intensifies, the Nicaraguan Government is aiming its sights at what it views as an equally dangerous enemy: the peddlers and small shopkeepers it has classified as ‘speculators, profiteers and hoarders.’’'

Now ask yourself how that differs from the current practice of clamping down on the speculators, profiteers and hoarders in the marijuana trade.

All that ends on New Year’s Day. That’s when the constitutional amendment to legalize marijuana takes effect.

But what happens then? That was a key question that remained unanswered as the Senate passed by a 23-17 margin a legalization bill passed earlier that day by the Assembly.

In the debate before the vote, state Sen. Nia Gill gave the best explanation of the problem. The Democrat from Montclair, who is a lawyer in real life, said the bill will cause confusion among both the police and the potheads.

“It is a misrepresentation to say people on January 2 can purchase marijuana legally,” said Gill. “They cannot.”

As Gill said, the bill does indeed legalize “possessing, purchasing, or transporting … one ounce or less of usable cannabis.”

But you can’t legally purchase that pot until the state-regulated dispensaries open up.

“Under this bill, that one ounce of marijuana cannot be legally purchased until we designate those stores where you can purchase this,” said Gill. “That could be well into 18 month.”

It could indeed. The Cannabis Regulatory Commission set up under the bill could take six months just to write the regulations before those merchants can even apply for licenses.

Then a network of state-sanctioned growers must be set up to grow the weed - sort of like the way the commies used to regulate corn farmers.

In the meantime, who’s going to sort this all out? Gill said that task will fall to the judiciary.

“I’m gonna vote for it so we can get some clarity,” Gill said, adding

“The Legislature’s not gonna do it but hopefully the courts will.”

This is where a good, old-fashioned free-market Republican could have contributed some insight. When he served in the state Assembly, Mike Carroll of Morris County offered a simple proposal for marijuana legalization: Strike the criminal code of any reference to marijuana. Treat it like tomatoes or any other crop.

That’s not the bill that passed after a couple years of intense debate. That bill features 240 pages of regulation.

The prime sponsor, state Sen. Nick Scutari of Union County, couldn’t have shepherded it through the Legislature without adding vast amounts of verbiage.

Scutari, who is also a lawyer, said he would expedite the approval of dispensaries and he called on police to leave potheads alone in the interim.

When I discussed this with Amol Sinha, the executive director of the state chapter of the ACLU, he agreed that the courts will have to sort things out for now.

But Sinha said the simplest approach would be for the regulatory commission to grant licenses to those already selling pot on what he termed “the legacy market.”

That has a nice ring to it compared to “the black market.”

“I think that people that are in the legacy market, as we call it, should be able to get a license in the regulated market,” Sinha said. “We need to create incentives and opportunities for people to enter the regulated market, and it shouldn’t be restricted to people with millions of dollars.”

People are already doing that, said one marketer who’s got quite a legacy. That’s Ed “NJ Weedman” Forchion.

Just after the bill passed, I called the Weedman at the coffeehouse on State Street in Trenton where he has been selling weed openly. He’s no longer the only member of the legacy market to go public, he said. Another outlet just opened on Broad Street and there are plenty more ready to take advantage of legalization, said Forchion.

“These places are popping up everywhere and they’re gonna sell weed on the First,” he said. “People are ingenious.”

Yes, they are.

As for politicians, not so much."	right

h79h8o	conservative	"Rand Paul introduces Justice for Breonna Taylor Act to ban ""no-knock"" warrants"	"Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) introduced a bill on Thursday that would prohibit federal law enforcement and local police that receive federal funding from entering homes without warning through a ""no-knock"" warrant, which was reportedly obtained by the officers that shot Louisville resident Breonna Taylor in her home on March 13.

Why it matters: In the wake of nationwide protests against the killing of George Floyd, there's now a bipartisan consensus that police reform is necessary.

Senate Republicans led by Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) are planning a package that would require states to provide data on the use of no-knock warrants, but Paul's proposal goes even further.

House Democrats, meanwhile, have proposed their own bill that would reform police training, make lynching a federal crime, and ban chokeholds and the use of no-knock warrants in drug cases.

The backdrop: Police who entered Taylor's home were reportedly investigating two men they believed to be selling drugs out of a house far from her house, according to the Louisville Courier Journal. They used a battering ram to break down her door and shot Taylor at least eight times after her boyfriend fired his gun at an officer in self-defense.

What he's saying: “After talking with Breonna Taylor’s family, I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s long past time to get rid of no-knock warrants. This bill will effectively end no-knock raids in the United States,” Paul said.

Cult of Trump: The 64-year-old said: 'And the question is how are we going to really almost deprogram these people who have signed up for the cult of Trump' (pictured in February, 2020)

Cause for concern: A source told Page Six: 'Katie's comments so soon after she was announced as a host are very concerning to the producers. They are worried there will be a backlash against her. There has already been some complaints' (pictured in April, 2019)

With an audience whose average age is 64.2 years old, the demographic has traditionally skewed conservative, and the show has made an effort to avoid politics.

A source told Page Six: 'Katie's comments so soon after she was announced as a host are very concerning to the producers. They are worried there will be a backlash against her. There has already been some complaints.

'Jeopardy viewers are quite a traditional bunch, and there's fears she might be too polarizing after this. At the very least, she already appears to have ruled herself out of becoming the permanent host of the show.'

Fox News contributor Joe Concha, who's firmly positioned himself against 'cancel culture', has recently spoken out against Couric.

He argued: 'This sort of rhetoric from Couric — which comes across as so condescending and elitist — underscores the divide between our media, which primarily resides in New York and Washington, and the rest of the country, which is moderate to center-right per multiple polls. And it's why the industry is so mistrusted and frowned upon.'

Following the death of beloved host Alex Trebek back in November, the show is taking on a series of guest hosts, including Mayim Bialik and Aaron Rodgers.

Trebek has commented on the need to be unoffensive in the past, telling Vulture in November of 2018: 'But one reason why a host can succeed for a long time is by not offending. You saw it with Johnny Carson. He was bright enough to cover almost any potentially offensive moment with his wit.'

Going for gold: Ken Jennings, 46, the record-holder for the show's longest winning streak, has also been serving as a guest host on Jeopardy!, and he's the rumored frontrunner to permanently fill the position

Public apology: He previously took to Twitter with an ambiguous apology for past statements that might have offended his followers, which some took for a smart move in securing his spot on the show (pictured in January, 2020)

Diva behavior: The Page Six source added: 'Ken Jennings apologizes for a tweet he posted nearly four years ago, weeks before hosting Jeopardy! Katie will be under huge pressure to apologize also. Time will tell if she does, but Jeopardy! producers are expecting her to be a diva about it' (pictured in March, 2019)

Granted, he made his opinion about Trump known in the same interview: 'I wouldn't say that [Trump] makes jokes. He picks on people.'

The Canadian gem also theorized on Trump's chances as a contestant: 'He might not agree that any of the correct responses are correct.'

Ken Jennings, 46, the record-holder for the show's longest winning streak, has also been serving as a guest host on Jeopardy!, and he's the rumored frontrunner to permanently fill the position.

He previously took to Twitter with an ambiguous apology for past statements that might have offended his followers, which some took for a smart move in securing his spot on the show.

The Planet Funny author has been known to make a joke or two about Trump, including once after comedienne Kathy Griffin posed for a now infamous 2017 photo with a fake severed head featuring the disgraced president's likeness.

Jennings jokingly commented about reports that Trump's youngest son Barron, now 14, saw the photo and thought it was real: 'Barron saw a very long necktie and a heap of expired deli meat in a dumpster. He thought it was his dad & his little heart is breaking.'

hpjj7v	conservative	Trump denies Minnesota governor's request for $500M to repair damage from riots	"President Trump has denied a request from Minnesota’s governor for money to rebuild parts of Minneapolis that were destroyed during the riots following the death of George Floyd.

“The Governor is disappointed that the federal government declined his request for financial support,” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's office said in a statement. “As we navigate one of the most difficult periods in our state’s history, we look for support from our federal government to help us through.”

Walz, a Democrat, asked that Trump declare Minnesota a “major disaster” zone in a request to the Federal Emergency Management Agency on July 2 after more than 1,500 buildings were damaged by looting and rioting in the wake of Floyd’s death, totaling over $500 million in damages.

At least one Republican in the state had lobbied the Trump administration in opposition to the request, arguing that the state’s response to the unrest should be thoroughly reviewed.

“If the federal government is expected to assist in the clean-up of these unfortunate weeks, it has an obligation to every American — prior to the release of funding — to fully understand the events which allowed for this level of destruction to occur and ensure it never happens again,” Rep. Tom Emmer wrote to the Trump administration in a letter .

Another congressman, Rep. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina, praised the Trump administration’s decision to reject Minnesota’s request, placing blame on the local officials who told the police to stand down during the rioting.

“Great news! @realDonaldTrump has DENIED Minnesota's disaster request to repair half a billion dollars in damage from the riots,” Duncan tweeted. “Governors and Mayors who ordered police to stand down and watch their cities burn shouldn't get a penny in taxpayer aid!”

Totally expected but still, you’d think by now they’d have learned that things always swing back the other way.

Not to mention the same big tech authoritarians who took down Parler may someday come for them.

Elon Musk spelled it out in one short but sweet tweet.

A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 11, 2021

jyvyjh	conservative	China now blaming Italy for starting Wuhan coronavirus pandemic	"Now that the election is over, and the media is portraying Biden as the “President Elect” despite looming legal challenges by President Donald Trump, China appears to be looking to lay blame elsewhere for the coronavirus pandemic.

That way, the nation can come in and resume its American-prosperity-draining relationship with what the Chinese hope to be a more friendly administration without the taint of initiating a series of biological release response actions to a new pathogen that guaranteed the virus would circuit the globe.

Reports indicate that China is using a new “study” about the an alleged “hidden spread” of coronavirus, naming Italy as the birthplace of the Wuhan coronavirus.

Officials in Beijing are pushing a new study that suggests the contagion may have been spreading in the European nation as early as September — three months before it was confirmed to be spreading in the long-assumed epicenter in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Times of London noted. The Asian nation has also previously questioned Spain about the origins of the pandemic, as well as the US military, claiming it brought the virus to Wuhan in October last year during the Military World Games, the report said. Chinese state media have now been strongly pushing the idea that the new study by the National Cancer Institute proves that the contagion likely started in Italy, not China, according to the UK paper.

The World Health Organization officially reports that the new coronavirus and Covid-19, the respiratory disease it causes, were unknown before the first cases were reported in Wuhan, in central China, in December, 2019. We began covering the outbreaks in January of this year. Italy’s first Covid-19 patient was first officially recorded in February.

However, the Italian research team looked at samples from patients in a lung cancer screening program and determined the first exposure to the coronavirus likely occurred in September of 2019.

A further specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies test was carried out by the University of Siena for the same research titled “Unexpected detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the pre-pandemic period in Italy”. It showed that four cases dated back to the first week of October were also positive for antibodies neutralizing the virus, meaning they had got infected in September, Giovanni Apolone, a co-author of the study, told Reuters. “This is the main finding: people with no symptoms not only were positive after the serological tests but had also antibodies able to kill the virus,” Apolone said. “It means that the new coronavirus can circulate among the population for long and with a low rate of lethality not because it is disappearing but only to surge again,” he added.

However, what the study revealed was that the virus was spreading beyond China earlier than originally thought.

“We know that China delayed announcing its outbreak. “So there is no telling when it started there, and China has very strong commercial links with northern Italy,” said Giovanni Apolone, at Milan’s National Cancer Institute.

klcblg	conservative	Two Korean-American women elected to Congress for the first time and not a peep from the national news. Guess what political party they're a part of?	"When Young Kim and Michelle Steel met up for family vacations more than 30 years ago, cooking meals and changing their daughters’ diapers as their husbands talked politics, neither had any idea that someday they would be the ones climbing the steps of the United States Capitol building.

But next year is someday. And early next month, Kim and Steel will be among the first Korean American women sworn into Congress.

The significance and the weight of that distinction isn’t lost on them.

“We were talking in front of the Capitol and I said, ‘Oh my God, I came (to the United States) when I was 19 and now I am working in that building,’” said Steel, 65, of Seal Beach, who last month defeated Rep. Harley Rouda to win the county’s coastal 48th District.

Kim and Steel were part of a notable GOP backflip. Their November wins — along with a win by David Valadao in the Central Valley — marked the first time California Republicans had taken out an incumbent House member since 1994.

The pair also are part of the largest cohort of women Republicans have ever sent to Congress. And they are the first women to represent their respective geographic districts.

“As a mother of four, I feel like I’ve naturally learned the negotiating skills to bring some win-win results,” said Kim, 58, of La Habra, who beat Rep. Gil Cisneros in the three-county 39th District. “I love to tell my story and share how important it is to have a woman’s voice.”

All of those distinctions contributed to the pair being named among the Orange County Register’s 100 Most Influential People of 2020.

Those distinctions also already landed the two women their first political mission, two weeks before they’ve even taken office. The Congressmembers-elect were invited to travel to Georgia together over the weekend to campaign for GOP Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler and to rally Asian American voters to turn out for the Jan. 5 runoff election that will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate.

“I think it’s a testament to the recognition of our growing voices at the national level,” Kim said.

During the campaign, Kim drew headlines for being one of a handful of Republicans to publicly criticize President Donald Trump, when she objected to his reference to the pandemic as the “kung flu” as being anti-Asian. While some on the right balked at her comments, others praised her for being willing to stand up for what she believes in even if it goes against her party’s leadership.

“We believe she will be an inspiring idol for future generations of Asian and other minority women to take up public service,” said Amit Desai, outreach director for the local chapter of Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh, a nonprofit that supports Hindus living outside India.

Along with winning her race, Steel also served this year as chair of the Orange County Board of Supervisors during the early waves of the coronavirus pandemic. Steel called for an early emergency declaration and helped oversee county health orders and the distribution of a half-billion dollars in federal funding allocated to the county to fight the virus.

Steel also initially questioned the efficacy of wearing a mask to slow spread of the virus, even as public health officials said masks were important. And she has championed reopening businesses, pushing back against health-focused mandates from Gov. Gavin Newsom. Those stances helped turn masks and lockdowns into political issues at a time when public health was deteriorating, but they also made her a hero to a vocal group of county residents who oppose masks and lockdowns. And the popularity of that argument helped secure Orange County’s reputation as a place that stands against government-mandated efforts to control the pandemic, according to Jodi Balma, political science professor at Fullerton College.

Steel said she’s proud of the work she did as board chair during the virus, saying she worked with the best information she had at the time.

Steel and Kim’s parents actually taught together in South Korea before they immigrated to the United States.

Steel’s father was a diplomat and his job took her family from South Korea to Japan, where Steel grew up and become fluent in Japanese. She came to the United States at 19 to attend Pepperdine University and soon married Shawn Steel, who’d go on to become chair of the California Republican Party.

Steel won a seat on the California State Board of Equalization in 2006 and then was elected to the Board of Supervisors in 2014. She beat Rouda in the CA-48 race this November by 8,376 votes, or 2.2 percentage points, declaring victory just a few days before Kim.

Kim moved with her family to the U.S. territory of Guam in 1975, then lived in Hawaii before moving to California. She worked in finance before starting her own small business in the women’s clothing industry. She also worked as a district aide for Rep. Ed Royce in CA-39 for more than two decades, heading up the office’s community outreach.

In 2014, she became the first Korean-American Republican woman elected to California’s Assembly, representing AD-65. She lost her reelection bid in 2016, then narrowly lost a 2018 challenge for CA-39 to Cisneros before winning the seat from him this year by 4,109 votes, or 1.2 percentage points.

Kim and Steel’s success in this election will have influence beyond their own party, Balma said, pushing Democrats to also focus on recruiting and supporting Asian American candidates.

Susan Lew, president of Asian Americans in Action, which advocates for progressive policies and candidates in Orange County, said she’s confident that having conservatives such as Steel and Kim in Congress “sends a message to the mainstream that there is no single, monolithic ‘Asian American Vote.’” And despite their political differences, Lew said, “I am hopeful that they will bring voice to issues affecting the AAPI community. After all, issues like health disparities, hunger, poverty, and anti-Asian racism, are not partisan.”

Kim said she does feel the weight of being the first Korean American woman in Congress along with Steel and Congresswoman-elect Marilyn Strickland, D-WA. She also knows that it can be challenging to make waves as a freshman member of the minority party.

“I do hope that my voice can be heard,” she said, “and that I can represent not only my district but also represent the underserved and underheard communities like the Asian American voice.”"	right
kgtkia	conservative	"Microsoft discovers SECOND hacking team dubbed ""Supernova"" installed backdoor in SolarWinds software in March - as Feds say first Russian ""act of war"" cyber attack struck at least 200 firms and US federal agencies now"	"Microsoft researchers say a second unidentified hacking team installed a backdoor in the same SolarWinds network software that facilitated a massive cyber espionage campaign, as the number of victims in the attack rose to 200.

The second backdoor, dubbed SUPERNOVA by security experts, appears distinct from the SUNBURST attack that has been attributed to Russia, raising the possibility that multiple adversaries were attempting parallel attacks, perhaps unbeknownst to each other.

It comes after President Donald Trump contradicted members of his own administration to suggest that China may be behind the sprawling attack, which compromised key federal agencies.

'The investigation of the whole SolarWinds compromise led to the discovery of an additional malware that also affects the SolarWinds Orion product but has been determined to be likely unrelated to this compromise and used by a different threat actor,' Microsoft said in a security blog on Friday.

The second backdoor is a piece of malware that imitates SolarWinds' Orion product but it is not 'digitally signed' like the other attack, suggesting this second group of hackers did not share the same access to the network management company's internal systems.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping is seen with Russian President Vladimir Putin. There is now evidence two adversaries compromised SolarWinds products, after Trump contradicted his own secretary of state to suggest China, rather than Russia was to blame

Microsoft's headquarters is seen above. The company says a second a second unidentified hacking team installed a backdoor in the same SolarWinds network software that facilitated a massive cyber espionage campaign

Microsoft identified the types of targets compromised in the attack in the above graphic

It is unclear whether SUPERNOVA has been deployed against any targets, such as customers of SolarWinds. The malware appears to have been created in late March, based on a review of the file's compile times.

The SUNBURST backdoor was first deployed in March, though the same group behind it appears to have tampered with SolarWinds products as early as October 2019.

In past breaches, security researchers have found evidence that more than one suspected Russian hacking group penetrated the same system, duplicating their efforts in a way that suggested each did not know what the other was doing.

One such case was the breach of the Democratic National Committee's servers in 2016, when CrowdStrike researchers found evidence that Russian hacking groups dubbed Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear had both broken into the system.

It's also possible that the SUPERNOVA and SUNBURST attacks represent the actions of separate nations attempting to use SolarWinds products to penetrate other high-value U.S. targets.

In a statement, a SolarWinds spokesman did not address SUPERNOVA, but said the company 'remains focused on collaborating with customers and experts to share information and work to better understand this issue.'

'It remains early days of the investigation,' the spokesman said.

Hackers used malicious code inserted into legitimate products from SolarWinds to target hundreds of high-value targets. Above, the company's Texas headquarters is seen

A graphic shows how the SUNBURST attack unfolded in networks that were compromised

Meanwhile, cybersecurity firm Recorded Future says it has identified 198 victims of the attack who were actively compromised through the backdoor, though the final number could rise further, according to Bloomberg.

Though compromised network software from SolarWinds Corp was downloaded by nearly 18,000 customers since March, the hackers only activated their Trojan horse backdoor, dubbed SUNBURST, on a handful of high-value targets.

The researchers did not name the victims, though experts at Microsoft have said most victims were government agencies, defense contractors, and technology providers. The departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Treasury, Commerce, Energy and State are known to be among the compromised victims.

Though Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday attributed the SUNBURST attack to Russia, President Donald Trump on Saturday broke his lengthy silence about the breach to suggest that China may be responsible.

'Russia, Russia, Russia is the priority chant when anything happens because Lamestream is, for mostly financial reasons, petrified of discussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!),' Trump said in a tweet.

Trump's assertion that China may be behind the hacking spree, runs counter to comments by Pompeo and multiple lawmakers briefed on the matter.

'We can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity,' said Pompeo on Friday in an interview. Russia has denied involvement in the attack.

Republican lawmaker Mitt Romney in a tweet on Thursday said the hack was 'like Russian bombers have been repeatedly flying undetected over our entire country.'

Donald Trump has broken his silence over the huge suspected Russian cyber attack claiming that China could be behind the attack

Trump tweeted claiming that China could be behind the attack, despite Secretary of State Mike Pompeo publicly blaming Russia the day before

Experts say that attribution of a skilled cyber breach can be difficult to pin down, and note that the tools used in the SUNBURST attack have never been seen before.

'Cyber attribution is exceptionally complex and relies on analysis not only of the tools and techniques used, but also the possible motivations,' Brett Callow, a threat analyst with cybersecurity firm Emsisoft, told DailyMail.com.

'What evidence the US government has that points to the attack being carried out by Russia - or, for that matter, China - is unclear at this point,' he added.

The hack first came into view last week, when U.S. cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc disclosed that it had itself been a victim of the very kind of cyberattack that clients pay it to prevent.

Publicly, the incident initially seemed mostly like an embarrassment for FireEye. But hacks of security firms are especially dangerous because their tools often reach deeply into the computer systems of their clients.

Days before the hack was revealed, FireEye researchers knew something troubling was afoot and contacted Microsoft Corp and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, three people involved in those communications told Reuters. Microsoft and the FBI declined to comment.

Their message: FireEye has been hit by an extraordinarily sophisticated cyber-espionage campaign carried out by a nation-state, and its own problems were likely just the tip of the iceberg.

A heatmap shows the locations of known victims of the breach identified by Microsoft

About half a dozen researchers from FireEye and Microsoft, set about investigating, said two sources familiar with the response effort.

At the root of the problem, they found, was something that strikes dread in cybersecurity professionals: so-called supply-chain compromises, which in this case involved using software updates to install malware that can spy on systems, exfiltrate information and potentially wreak other types of havoc.

In 2017, Russian operatives used the technique to knock out private and government computer systems across Ukraine, after hiding a piece of malware known as NotPetya in a widely used accountancy program. Russia has denied that it was involved. The malware quickly infected computers in scores of other countries, crippling businesses and causing hundreds of millions of dollars of damage.

The latest U.S. hack employed a similar technique: SolarWinds said its software updates had been compromised and used to surreptitiously install malicious code in nearly 18,000 customer systems. Its Orion network management software is used by hundreds of thousands of organizations.

Once downloaded, the program signaled back to its operators where it had landed. In some cases where access was especially valuable, the hackers used it to deploy more active malicious software to spread across its host.

In some of the attacks, the intruders combined the administrator privileges granted to SolarWinds with Microsoft´s Azure cloud platform - which stores customers´ data online - to forge authentication 'tokens.' Those gave them far longer and wider access to emails and documents than many organizations thought was possible.

The Pentagon was among the SolarWinds customers who received the malicious updates. Teams are now searching DoD networks for evidence of intrusion and backdoors

Los Alamos National Laboratory, which conducts the nation's most advanced nuclear research, was also a target in the massive cyber espionage campaign

Hackers could then steal documents through Microsoft's Office 365, the online version of its most popular business software, the NSA said on Thursday in an unusual technical public advisory. Also on Thursday, Microsoft announced it found malicious code in its systems.

'This is powerful tradecraft, and needs to be understood to defend important networks,' Rob Joyce, a senior NSA cybersecurity adviser, said on Twitter.

It is unknown how or when SolarWinds was first compromised. According to researchers at Microsoft and other firms that have investigated the hack, intruders first began tampering with SolarWinds' code as early as October 2019, a few months before it was in a position to launch an attack."	right

For my money, there are few more entertaining onscreen personalities than the 51-year-old Michigan native. The actor’s proven himself as both an action man and a comedian — a very hard-to-pull-off combo.

He’s a guy who likes to mix it up — the same applies, apparently, where race is concerned.

Last week, I covered Terry’s June 30th tweet:

“If you are a child of God, you are my brother and sister. I have family of every race, creed and ideology. We must ensure #blacklivesmatter doesn’t morph into #blacklivesbetter.”

As it turns out, he’s doubling down.

Here’s Crews on Independence Day:

“Are all white people bad? No. Are all black people good? No. Knowing this reality — I stand on my decision to unite with good people, no matter the race, creed or ideology.”

And that wasn’t all:

“Given the number of threats against this decision — I also decide to die on this hill.”

Sounds like a man who’s made up his mind.

A backlash against the notion of racial equality seems a surprising turn we’ve taken.

Not long ago, Equality and Unity were things championed by all — on both sides of the political aisle. In fact, some on the Left seemed to, at times, attempt to claim such an idea as theirs alone.

But now, it appears, unity is the enemy.

If that’s the adversary, who — or what — is the protagonist in our hero’s journey to utopia? Is it segregation, and we’re back at the same place as 70 years ago?

We’re already dividing the races similarly once more — according to the latest terminology, there are “people of color” and there are white people. So whites, and non-whites. To where are we on our way? And what does it tell us about the future, if we won’t be arriving there together?

Regardless, Terry Crews wants to get to the other side of today with good people.

I hope we can all choose the same. And that we can be those good people for one other.

gvkpub	conservative	Black Police Chief killed by looters in St. Louis while attempting to defend Pawn Shop	"An officer in Las Vegas reportedly was on life support after being shot.

A retired St. Louis police captain who became a small-town police chief was found fatally shot early Tuesday outside a pawn shop that was looted after protests over the death of George Floyd turned violent.

David Dorn, 77, was discovered on the sidewalk in front of Lee's Pawn & Jewelry in St. Louis around 2:30 a.m., said Police Commissioner John Hayden. He said Dorn, who retired from the St. Louis Police Department in 2007 and had been serving as police chief of Moline Acres, Missouri, since 2008, was killed when he apparently tried to stop the looting of the shop.

""David Dorn was exercising law enforcement training that he learned here,"" Hayden said. No further details were immediately released.

His widow, Ann Marie Dorn, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that her husband was a friend of the pawn shop's owner and frequently checked on the business when alarms went off.

The death came on a brutal night for police across the country.

A Las Vegas police officer on life support was last listed in critical condition after being shot Monday night attempting to disperse a large crowd of protesters outside a casino, authorities said.

An officer was attacked in New York City, and four cops were shot in St. Louis as demonstrations across the nation in the aftermath of George Floyd's death have turned increasingly violent for both protesters and police.

At least five deaths have occurred during the widespread unrest, according to The New York Times.

Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Officer Shay Mikalonis, 29, was critically wounded engaging with violent protesters outside the Circus Circus Hotel & Casino on the famed Las Vegas Strip. Separately, police fatally shot a heavily armed man who appeared to be wearing body armor outside a federal courthouse nearby.

""This is a sad night for LVMPD family and a tragic night for our community,"" LVMPD Sheriff Joe Lombardo said at a news conference. ""With these protests, which are leading to riots, one tragedy is only leading to another.""

Lombardo said his officers were being pelted with rocks and bottles.

""Our officers were attempting to get some of the protesters in custody when a shot rang out and our officer went down,"" he added.

Mikalonis was taken to Las Vegas University Medical Center, where he was in ""extremely critical condition."" Police officials said he underwent surgery to remove a bullet from his neck.

A suspect was arrested by a SWAT team, but that person's name wasn't immediately released, Lombardo added.

While LVMPD officers were investigating the shooting, officers guarding the Foley Federal Building were confronted by an armed man around 11:22 p.m., Lombardo said. That suspect, who appeared to be wearing body armor, had multiple firearms.

""During the interaction, the subject reached for his firearm and our officers engaged him,"" Lombardo said. The suspect, who hasn't yet been identified, died at the hospital. It's unclear whether that individual had been among the protesters, Lombardo added.

The four officers wounded in St. Louis on Monday night were shot near police headquarters, where clashes with rioters lasted well into the night.

""They were standing near a line and all of a sudden they felt pain,"" Police Commissioner Hayden said during a news conference Tuesday morning. ""They were just standing there. So some coward fired shots at officers, and now we have four in the hospital ... and thank God they're alive. Can we make some sense out of this? ... This is horrible.""

The officers, ranging in age from 28 to 52, suffered non-life-threatening injuries. Before the shootings, demonstrators hurled rocks and fireworks at police, and some officers had gasoline dumped on them, Hayden added.

Meanwhile in New York City, video emerged that appeared to show an officer being attacked with a heavy object by a group of men in the Bronx. The New York Police Department said it made nearly 700 arrests Monday night as looting and vandalism targets included stores at Rockefeller Center and some in the Upper East Side. A curfew of 11 p.m. had been put in effect.

""We saw stuff last night that we will not accept. And we can fight back, and we will fight back,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference on Tuesday. ""I have confidence in the people of New York City, I have confidence in the leaders in communities, I have confidence in the NYPD.

""There's a lot of people trying to express fear, a lot of people trying to tear down, a lot of people say they don't believe in the people of this city, they don't believe in people in our communities, they don't believe in our police officers. To hell with all of them. I don't care if they're left or right or center -- I am sick of people attacking New York City.""

Floyd died May 25 in Minneapolis. His final moments were captured in a searing video of a white officer with his knee on Floyd's black neck as he pleaded for his life. ""I can't breathe,"" Floyd said."	right

U.S.—The Babylon Bee has been the world's best satire site for thousands of years, spawning dozens of secular knock-offs that just aren't quite as good.

The Bee announced a new acquisition this week, one that immediately made it the largest satirical site on the planet: a purchase of competing satire outlet CNN for $12 billion. The move more than quadrupled the site's catalog of hilarious, satirical articles.

""We've long admired CNN's ability to parody leftist media organizations so effortlessly, and we're thrilled to have them under The Babylon Bee's umbrella,"" said site CEO Seth Dillon. ""When you can't compete with hilarious satire like CNN, you obviously look for ways to get them on your team, and an acquisition seemed to make the most sense.""

The new conglomerate organization will be called BNN. CNN writers and hosts will be instructed to simply keep doing what they're doing.

""We don't want them to change anything since you don't try to fix satirical content that's already incredible,"" Dillon said. ""They'll just keep churning out incredibly skewed content in order to satirize the leftist media's inability to report anything without bias or prejudice.""

Brian Stelter will produce satirical videos for The Babylon Bee, moving the site into the realm of video content for the first time. Again, though, his show's content will remain unchanged.

CNN will also benefit, as their content will now be clearly labeled satire, protecting them from getting sued to high heaven for their skewed coverage.

Site founder Adam Ford was against the move, but nobody listens to him anymore."	right

i30f6f	conservative	Trump signs order banning federal agencies from firing U.S. citizens to replace them with foreigners	"President Trump on Monday signed an executive order banning federal agencies — with particular attention on the technology sector — from firing U.S. citizens or green card holders only to replace them with foreigners.

The order, which the White House is calling the Executive Order on Hiring American, challenges federal contractors' use of H-1B visas to bring in temporary foreign labor for high-skilled jobs rather than relying on American workers

""This Executive Order follows his Buy American, Hire American Executive Order from April 2017 and takes further action to prevent Americans from being displaced by foreign workers,"" the White House said in a statement released Monday. ""Under President Trump’s leadership, the firing of hardworking Americans in the pursuit of cheap foreign labor will not be tolerated.""

Trump's action was in part to prevent the outsourcing of jobs at the Tennessee Valley Authority, the federally owned corporation created by congressional charter in 1933 to provide electricity, economic development and other essential services to the region.

At the White House signing ceremony Monday, Trump said he's pushing for the removal of authority CEO Jeff Lyash and called on its board to make sure Lyash ""does not receive a lavish compensation package upon his departure too.""

""He gets $8 million a year, so that was just a succession of deep swamp things happening, and it's a disgrace,"" Trump said. ""So let this serve as a warning to any federally appointed board. If you betray American workers, then you will hear two simple words, 'You're fired.'""

Lyash almost immediately after the order signing contacted the White House, saying he wanted to settle the labor dispute. But Trump nevertheless fired Lyash, according to the Associated Press.

In June, Trump also signed an executive order extending foreign-worker restrictions through Dec. 31, citing the high unemployment rate among Americans. That order prohibited visas for most guest workers who come to the U.S. for temporary or seasonal work but exempts farm workers and some within the food service industry.

In April, Trump issued an executive order temporarily suspending immigration due to coronavirus, saying it would be 60-day pause and impact only those seeking permanent residency, also known as a green card, not temporary employment.

The policy change follows a lawsuit Monday by 17 states and the District of Columbia challenging the policy change. The suit was originally filed by several colleges including Harvard and MIT."	right

WASHINGTON, D.C.—Journalists are praising Joe Biden after he announced that every bomb he drops in the Middle East from now on will be purchased from a black-owned business.

President Biden made the announcement in front of a huge crowd of white journalists on Zoom, who cheered so loud after hearing the news that President Biden had to adjust his earpiece.

""Hey, folks-- here's the deal: we gotta drop some bombs. We just do. That's how things are,"" said Biden. ""We have all these extra bombs lying around collecting dust and we have to drop them on those people over there who -- as intelligence is telling us -- are bad people. They're bad people folks!

""But we're gonna purchase all our future bombs from some clean, articulate black business owners who make bombs. It's just the right thing to do,"" he continued.

Unfortunately, it was later discovered that there are no black business owners in the country who make bombs for the U.S. military. ""Ah man-- that's too bad,"" said Biden, before canceling his meeting with Al Sharpton.

ATLANTA, GA—A CDC scientist has called on the nation to cancel Thanksgiving, but many are suspicious of the announcement, since the scientist looks remarkably like a turkey wearing a lab coat and sciency-looking glasses.

""We must cancel Thanksgiving this year. It is completely off the table,"" the scientist, Dr. Peck N. Gobble, said.

The scientist also said we should cancel Christmas gatherings, especially ones where poultry is traditionally served.

lrdqbu	conservative	DNA test said a California man was 4 percent black. Now he wants to qualify as a minority business owner.	"By Antonia Noori Farzan | The Washington Post

When Ralph Taylor was born in Sacramento in 1963, his birth certificate indicated that he and his parents were Caucasian. But, like many white Americans, he grew up hearing vague family lore about long-distant Native American ancestry.

“I’ve always known that I’m multiracial,” Taylor, 55, told The Washington Post.

In 2010, Taylor took an AncestryByDNA test, he said, “just to confirm what we’d already known.” The results said that he was 90 percent European and 6 percent indigenous American, as well as 4 percent sub-Saharan African.

Whether the test was accurate is an open question. Scientists have long critiqued ancestry DNA tests for being imprecise and lacking transparency. The company that manufactured Taylor’s test is no longer conducting ancestry genetic testing, according to the Seattle Times, and in 2014 one genealogy blog suggested that AncestrybyDNA tests were so outdated that they were best used as paper airplanes.

Still, the results were enough for Taylor to update his birth certificate last November: It now says that he is black, Native American and Caucasian.

Taylor acknowledges that he looks white. But despite being “visually Caucasian,” as he puts it, he considers himself to be multiracial.

“I’m a certified black man,” he told The Post. “I’m certified black in all 50 states. But the federal government doesn’t recognize me.”

After he was rejected from a program for minority business owners that would have given him an advantage when competing for lucrative government contracts, Taylor sued. His case, which raises complicated questions about how race is defined, is pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.

The legal battle got its start in 2013. With the test results in hand, Taylor applied to get his insurance agency certified as a minority-owned business by Washington state’s Office of Minority and Women’s Business Enterprises. As the Seattle Times first reported, he was initially rejected on the grounds that he wasn’t visibly identifiable as a minority.

But the agency didn’t give employees any guidelines about how to interpret applicants’ photos and didn’t define what exactly it meant to be “visibly identifiable” as a member of a minority group. After he filed an appeal, the agency reversed its decision and approved his application in March 2014.

Weeks after getting the acceptance letter, Taylor applied to the Office of Minority and Women’s Business Enterprises again – this time to get certified as a minority for the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program. The agency asked him for additional proof that he identified as black or Native American.

Taylor said that he was a member of the NAACP, subscribed to Ebony magazine and was interested in black social issues. He also gave the agency a copy of a death certificate for a black woman who had died in 1916, but he was unable to prove that they were related. Many record depositories had been burned during the Civil War, he wrote, making it difficult to trace his genealogy. And because being Native American wasn’t socially acceptable back in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia during those days, he said, he didn’t have any proof of his Native American ancestry.

He was rejected.

“It is nonsensical for Mr. Taylor to claim that he has encountered social and economic disadvantage due to a heritage he was not aware of until the DNA test conducted in 2010,” the state’s letter said.

Taylor was frustrated by the inconsistency – how could he be a disadvantaged minority for the purpose of a state-level program but not a federal-level one? He decided to sue.

“It’s just not a fair system,” he told The Washington Post. “Hopefully, what comes out of this is that the system is broken.”

In his lawsuit, which was filed in July 2016, Taylor argues that the way the federal government determines black and Native American ancestry for the purpose of the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program is “impermissibly vague” and is likely to result in “arbitrary and capricious decisions.”

Federal law defines black Americans as “persons having origins in any of the Black racial groups of Africa.” Taylor’s lawsuit notes that the statute doesn’t set a minimum percentage of African DNA that an individual needs to be considered black.

Previously, the government defined Native Americans as “persons who are American Indians, Eskimos, Aleuts, or Native Hawaiians.” In October 2014, after Taylor applied for certification, the statute was updated to define Native Americans as “persons who are enrolled members of a federally or State recognized Indian tribe, Alaska Natives, or Native Hawaiians.”

Taylor finds both distinctions arbitrary. Ideally, he says, he would like to see the minority-business certification process scrapped and replaced with a program that would be based on socioeconomic status, not race.

After all, he points out, the son of a millionaire such as Michael Jordan would be considered “disadvantaged” under the existing guidelines.

“My forefathers were just as distressed as anyone else’s,” he told The Post. “We all have the ability to come from bad backgrounds.”

The Office of Minority and Women’s Business Enterprises has not publicly commented on the lawsuit. Gigi Zenk, a former spokeswoman, told the Seattle Times that the office determines who qualifies as a minority on a case-by-case basis. “We work really hard to be fair. Nothing is just black and white,” she said.

In November 2016, a district court judge in Tacoma dismissed the lawsuit, describing Taylor’s focus on his genetic background as “misplaced.” His attorneys appealed the ruling that month. Oral arguments are scheduled to take place before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in December.

Taylor says that his lawsuit, now four years in the making, is entirely self-funded. He told the Seattle Times this month that he had spent up to $300,000 so far but declined to confirm that exact figure when speaking with The Post on Monday.

“It’s a lot,” he said of his mounting legal fees. “I don’t want to get into the specifics, but it’s a lot.”

But he’s not backing down.

“I told my attorneys, we’ll go to the Supreme Court if we have to,” he said."	right
kslbhi	conservative	Conservative journalists who've closely covered Antifa violence say leftist militants were not behind Capitol siege	"Despite numerous claims on social media that Antifa militants were behind Wednesday's siege on the U.S. Capitol, a pair of conservative journalists who've closely covered the violent leftist group say that is not case.

What are the details?

Andy Ngo — who literally wrote the book on Antifa's lawlessness — told the Washington Examiner that from his vantage point, Antifa militants weren't part of the group that rioted inside the Capitol building.

""The people occupying the Capitol building do not look like Antifa people dressed in Trump gear or Trump costumes,"" he told the paper in an interview from England.

""I have seen no evidence that they are able to coordinate a mass infiltration on this scale before, so I'm really skeptical that they would have been able to do it here without any of that information leaking out,"" Ngo added to the Examiner.

Ngo ought to know, too. In addition to penning a book, he's repeatedly infiltrated Antifa as well as Black Lives Matter gatherings to get first-hand reporting about their actions, tendencies, and core values.

And probably most important of all, if anyone out there has a reason to burn Antifa to the ground, it's Ngo. Readers of TheBlaze probably recall that the violent leftists — who claim they're fascism fighters while wantonly practicing fascism at every turn — ganged up on and brutally beat Ngo in a June 2019 incident captured on video.

Check out our brave heroes — their identities concealed with masks and hoods — swarming around Ngo, who's all alone. (Content warning: Language):

Conservative writer Andy Ngo roughed up at Portland antifa/right wing protests youtu.be

They seem nice.

Oh, and Antifa militants regularly threaten Ngo's life. So for him to debunk the claim that Antifa was behind the Capitol siege certainly carries a distinct ring of authenticity.

But at the same time, Ngo isn't letting the mainstream media off the hook. He called them out for repeatedly treating Antifa rioting as a noble act while suddenly becoming interested in the rule of law when supporters of President Donald Trump rioted in the Capitol building.

In addition to Ngo, TheBlaze's Elijah Schaffer — who covered the Capitol siege Wednesday and has seen Antifa in action many times — tossed water on the theory that the violent leftists were behind the lawlessness in D.C."	right

hr5sh2	conservative	Nick Cannon calls white and Jewish people “the true savages,” claims they are “closer to animals”	"Last Updated Jul 19th, 2020 at 5:32 pm

Nick Cannon, Black Lives Matter activist who is famous for his role as host of variety shows ""The Masked Singer"" and ""America's Got Talent,"" made racially provocative remarks on a recent podcast episode that are being labeled both racist and anti-Semitic.

During his comments, Cannon declared that white people are ""a little less,"" ""closer to animals,"" ""the true savages,"" and are ""acting out of a deficiency, so the only way they can act is evil.""

Video:

Cannon hosted a rapper named Professor Griff on the June 30 episode of his podcast, ""Cannon's Class,"" where the two spoke warmly of the notoriously anti-Semitic Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, as well as shared their views on Jewish cabals secretly ruling the world.

Cannon said a lack of melanin in one's skin directly correlates to a lack of compassion.

""That's the melanin that connects us, so the people that don't have it are — and I'm going to say this carefully — are a little less."" Cannon said.



""When they were sent to the Mountains of Caucasus, they didn't have the power of the sun. The sun started to deteriorate them. So, they're acting out of fear, they're acting out of low self-esteem, they're acting out of deficiency, so therefore the only way they can act is evil.



They have to rob, steal, rape, kill, and fight in order to survive. So these people who didn't have what we have, and when I say ‘we,' I speak of the melanated people, they had to be savages, they had to be barbaric because they're in these Nordic mountains, they're in these rough torrential environments, so they're acting as animals, so they're the ones closer to animals, they're the ones that are actually the true savages.""

Cannon went on to make clear he was referencing ""Jewish people, white people, Europeans, the Illuminati,"" in his remarks.

Professor Griff made clear his belief that black people were actually the Semitic race, and therefore it was impossible for him, a black man, to truly be anti-Semitic.

""In order for me to be anti-Semitic, I'd have to be anti-black man, anti-black woman, anti-black people, anti-Africa, anti-all other people,"" Griff said.

hu7b2g	conservative	Terry Crews addresses Nick Cannon supporters: 'I was never afraid of the KKK ... it was people like you'	"Get the latest BPR news delivered free to your inbox daily. SIGN UP HERE.

Actor Terry Crews says he’s more terrified of left-wing mobs than he ever was of the Ku Klux Klan, the hate group once notoriously supported by Democrats. Why? Because unlike today’s violent leftists, the KKK never bullied him or made death threats against him.

Crews, a burly former NFL player, made the remarks in response to the hateful leftists who are harassing him nonstop after he slammed actor Nick Cannon for his anti-white, antisemitic tirade.

Crews tweeted: When I was young, I was never afraid of the KKK…It was people like you. The threats, the intimidation discouraging free thought, and “the insult of acting white.”

Crews was reacting to a Twitter leftist who screeched: “You going so hard against Nick Cannon, but when you fall, NO BLACK PERSON will have your back.”

When I was young, I was never afraid of the KKK… It was people like you. The threats, the intimidation, discouraging free thought, and “the insult of acting white”. My heart breaks because your behavior only reveals you don’t know how powerful you are. https://t.co/vgJU9TCgmZ — terry crews (@terrycrews) July 15, 2020

Crews posted a photo montage of himself urging Americans to unite amid the media-stoked race war.

Terry tweeted these words along with a call for Peace, Live, and Unity: “We are all in this together. Indivisible.”

Terry Crews has been viciously harassed by left-wing mobs after slamming the Marxist Black Lives movement as a racist “black supremacy” coalition.

Last week, Crews got into a shouting match with CNN opinion host Don Lemon, who cut him off when Crews said Black Lives Matter is metastasizing into a “very, very dangerous” anti-white crusade.

Crews enraged Lemon when he pointed out that black lives really don’t matter to BLM, as evidenced by its silence on the alarming surges on black-on-black violence amid BLM’s calls to defund the police.

In June, Crews sounded the alarm on the militant Black Lives Matter movement.

“Defeating white supremacy without white people could create black supremacy,” Crews said. “In black America, we have gatekeepers. We have people who have decided that who is black and who’s not. And I — simply because I have a mixed-race wife — have been discounted from the conversation by very, very militant black-power movements.”

Crews continued: “I’ve been called all kinds of things like an Uncle Tom, simply because I’m successful, simply because I worked my way out of Flint, Michigan. When you’re white, you can be Republican, libertarian, Democrat. But if you’re black, you have to be one thing [Democrat].”

Crews then invoked Joe Biden’s racist “you ain’t black” rant as proof that Democrats think they own the black vote and they’re the arbiters of who is “black enough.”

“Even Joe Biden said, ‘If you don’t vote for me, you ain’t even black,'” Crews said. “So blackness is always judged. And I’m going, ‘That is a supremacist move.’ You have now put yourself above other black people. In 1994, in Rwanda, there was a genocide. And it was all black people because there was one sector that viewed themselves as over the other. A million people died.”

Crews said there is definitely a hateful black supremacy movement festering in America because he has seen it himself.

“I’ve had black people tell me that the white man is the devil,” Crews recounted. “I experienced whole organizations that have viewed themselves [as better than whites] because of the suffering of black people. They have decided that now we are not equal — we’re better. That’s a mistake. You can develop a dangerous self-righteousness that could really hurt what we’re trying to do. We have to include this white voice, this Hispanic voice, this Asian voice. We have to include it right now. Because if we don’t, it’s going to slip into something we are really not prepared for [and that’s an all-out race war].”

jtm4dr	conservative	Steven Crowder Surpasses ‘The Young Turks’ As Largest Online News Channel | The Daily Wire	"This week, conservative podcast host Steven Crowder surpassed “The Young Turks” in YouTube subscribers, becoming the largest independent news channel on the platform, crossing the 5.03 million subscriber mark on Tuesday afternoon.

Amid a time of increased demand for news and commentary outside of the traditional legacy media outlets, Crowder has risen with his massively popular “Change My Mind” series, and his comedic digital shorts and daily commentary.

He celebrated the development on Twitter, announcing: “Today, [Louder With Crowder] passes [The Young Turks] as the biggest independent online news/commentary channel on youtube… and we did it all without millions in foreign funding. I will retire my Cenk impression and costume, in the middle of the studio. Forever. 10AM ET.”

Today, #LwC passes @TYT as the biggest independant online news/commentary channel on youtube… and we did it all without millions in foreign funding. I will retire my Cenk impression and costume, in the middle of the studio. Forever. 10AM ET. — Steven Crowder (@scrowder) November 12, 2020

Crowder’s followers took to social media to celebrate, with thousands of users tweeting the #CrowderPassesTYT hashtag.

The Young Turks, long an outspoken rival of Crowder, gained popularity throughout the 2016 and 2020 elections, avidly supporting Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in both of his presidential bids.

Cenk Uygur, the Young Turks’ creator and most popular host, has consistently butted heads with Crowder over the years, often devoting entire segments to attacking him.

“TYT were definitely pioneers and they reigned for an era. No one can take that away from them. That era has now come to an end,” Crowder told The Daily Wire.

“The victory felt somewhat hollow considering how far they’ve fallen,” he said, before adding “It’s not the same ‘win’ I pictured when I was a 21 year old kid and they were the big, bad bullies of YouTube.”

As part of Tuesday’s show, Crowder aired a compilation of his past run-ins with Uygur and The Young Turks and vowed to retire his impression of Uygur, a popular recurring segment. “It is time to officially retire the Young Turks Cenk Uygur costume and character,” he said, as taps played in the background and a black costume was soberly laid on the ground.

Crowder’s impressive influence was on display on election night, when his live coverage was seen by millions, garnering more viewers than cable outlets like CBS, NBC, and MSNBC. Only Fox News and CNN bested Crowder’s audience, despite the fact that YouTube had flagged his stream as “borderline content.”

“Borderline content” is a term YouTube uses for news they deem overly biased, preferring instead to promote what they call “authoritative voices,” like traditional legacy media outlets.

Crowder is no stranger to run-ins with YouTube; his content was demonetized by the platform for a year after he was banned from their “Partner Program,” an ad revenue program for creators. As The Daily Wire reported at the time:

YouTube reinstated Crowder into its Partner Program on [Aug. 12] after suspending him on June 5, 2019, over comments and jokes he made about then-Vox journalist Carlos Maza, as well as for selling merchandise with the label “Socialism is for f*gs,” according to Tubefilter. At the time it demonetized Crowder, YouTube conceded that none of Crowder’s content violated its hate policies. The video platform ultimately decided to pull advertising off of Crowder’s content after stating that the commentator had engaged in a “pattern of egregious actions” that “harmed the broader community and is against our YouTube Partner Program policies.”

As a result of the threat posed by censorship and demonetization, Crowder has relied heavily on membership options and subscription programs through BlazeTV.

jrol5g	conservative	After Wiping Out Half The Universe, Thanos Calls For Unity	"After Wiping Out Half The Universe, Thanos Calls For Unity

WASHINGTON, D.C.—After a lengthy campaign to wipe out half of all life in the universe, controversial environmental activist Thanos has called for humanity to come together, end their divisions, and unify.

The environmentalist activist gave a victory speech after accomplishing his plan to acquire the Infinity Stones, place them in a specially designed glove, and snap his fingers to end billions of lives.

""Now that I have destroyed half of all life in existence, it is time for unity,"" Thanos said in a speech Tuesday. ""I know I treated you all as enemies and called for your total destruction, making it my life's mission to slaughter half the organic life in our reality. But now it is time for our universe to heal.""

""I will be a kind ruler not just for those who supported me, but for those who opposed me as well. We are all friends here.""

One group of superheroes says they will oppose Thanos's call for unity, but they are being called right-wing agitators since one of them has an American flag on his shield.

Democrats are praising Thanos as a hero, since many Trump supporters died after the snap, along with millions of unborn babies."	right
lqwr2c	conservative	Elon Musk responds to Washington Post hit piece: 'Give my regards to your puppet master'	"The Washington Post published a piece today which clearly intends to be a hit piece on Elon Musk and Tesla. The headline gives a sense of the piece’s take: “Elon Musk moved to Texas and embraced celebrity. Can Tesla run on Autopilot?” But in the very first paragraph, the story undercuts the claim that Tesla is running on autopilot.

The chief executive of both electric car manufacturer Tesla and rocket company SpaceX bounces nearly daily on his private jet between locations — traveling to his longtime home in southern California, Tesla’s plant in the Bay Area, the site of a new factory in Austin, Texas and SpaceX’s launch facility on that state’s Gulf Coast.

Soon we get to what this story is really about, providing space to Musk’s critics.

Critics say the rigors of Musk’s personal schedule, and the seeming cult of personality that has developed around him, are beginning to show in the car company he runs… In interviews with a dozen current and former Tesla employees, investors and analysts, critics pointed to a series of questionable business moves, and even outright missteps by Tesla, as a potential symptom of the outside demands on Musk.

One of Musk’s critics, cites the Cybertruck debut back in November 2019 as a sign of how things are going at Tesla. You may remember one of the truck’s windows broke during the event. Granted that was momentarily embarrassing for Musk but did that make the debut a failure? Not really. As of last July Tesla had received 650,000 preorders for the truck at $100 each. A lot of other car companies would kill for that kind of failure.

The story bounces awkwardly along between the vague concerns of the critics and the fact that Tesla had a very successful year in 2020, which seems to suggest things aren’t going too badly right now.

Musk’s impulsive leadership has worked to Tesla’s benefit so far. His bets have resulted in huge successes, vaulting Tesla from an upstart electric vehicle pioneer to the world’s most valuable automaker. The company delivered a record of nearly 500,000 vehicles in 2020 and has cannibalized prospective U.S. electric vehicle sales from practically every other automaker… After hitting a near-term low of $177 per share in mid-2019, Tesla’s stock soared to a new high of more than $2,000 just over a year later, before the company implemented a 5-for-1 split late last summer. Tesla’s cash flow woes had abated and the company was posting consecutive quarters of profitability.

By the end of the piece, we’re back to the critics who are upset about Musk’s recent tweets about cryptocurrency. One unnamed employee said he was upset when another employee followed Musk’s lead and invested $70,000 worth of company stock in Bitcoin. He told his fellow employee, Musk “doesn’t care about you; he’ll ruin you.” Again, the specifics are vague but it might be a stretch to claim that an employee who had $70,000 of company stock on hand had been ruined by Elon Musk.

Perhaps sensing what kind of story this was going to be, Musk’s only response to the Post’s request for comment was: “Give my regards to your puppet master.”"	right

It is important to state clearly what happened yesterday in the nation’s capital. A violent mob, stoked by the president of the United States, directly attacked two fundamental foundations of the American republic—the election of a new president and the peaceful transfer of power. The mob attacked the police defending the Capitol, broke down barriers, shattered windows, and succeeded in not only temporarily stopping the constitutionally mandated process of recognizing Joe Biden’s victory, they also briefly occupied and controlled the Capitol itself. In the midst of the attack, one woman was shot and killed. The total death count as of this moment is four.

Our nation has not seen a hostile takeover of the Capitol of this scale or duration since the British Army burned much of Washington during the War of 1812. Not even the Confederacy could achieve what Americans witnessed today.

This attack wasn’t just foreseeable, it was foreseen. At The Dispatch, we have been warning about the possibility of serious political violence for months. The president and many of his supporters have falsely claimed that the presidential election was stolen and have trafficked in transparently ridiculous conspiracy theories. They have told bizarre tales about false and even impossible schemes to corrupt the vote. And they’ve done this while speaking in apocalyptic terms about the fate of the nation.

Share

Trump-appointed judges rejected the president’s wild claims of fraud and illegality. Responsible Republican officials, including the secretary of state of Georgia, have clearly, transparently, and painstakingly rebutted conspiracy theories and claims of fraud. For this public service, they’ve been rewarded with an avalanche of death threats and acts of intimidation.

At the same time, important members of the conservative media, including talk-radio host Mark Levin, have advanced increasingly wild ideas to overturn the results of the election. They first urged that state legislators overrule their own voters. When that hare-brained scheme failed, Levin and others urged Congress to reject the results of the election—something Congress has no power to do.

Cowed by the president and with their eyes fixed on their own political futures, Republican members of Congress have picked up this seditious torch, including trained lawyers who know exactly how they’re violating the Constitution yet press on anyway. Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana has been especially pernicious. He once performed valuable work defending religious liberty with the Alliance Defending Freedom. Now he deploys his legal skills to rally GOP members of the House to attack the American republic.

Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz in the Senate have proved themselves unfit to serve during this crisis. Both men know the Constitution. Both men know that Trump’s legal claims have failed at every level of the American court system, including at the Supreme Court of the United States. Yet they have pressed on with their futile challenges anyway, proudly proclaiming their defiance in conservative media outlets that have lost their way.

And with each presidential lie, with each shouting pundit’s misinformation-filled tirade against the election, and with each cowardly congressional capitulation to the outrage of the Trumpist mob, the temperature was raised, degree by degree, until yesterday’s explosion.

Yet even then—even with bloodshed in the halls of the Capitol and Congress itself under attack—the president still stoked rage and division. He tweeted his anger at Vice President Mike Pence for failing to hand him the election. Even when he called for calm and asked rioters to go home, he repeated his false claims about a stolen election. In one of the lowest moments of a very dark day, he told the rioters who stormed the Capitol, “We love you.” “You’re very special,” he said. “Law and order for thee, but not for me,” seems to be the rule for this fundamentally disordered and lawless president.

Today’s terrible events have made crystal clear what should long have been plainly understood—Trump is dangerous to the peace and security of the American nation. Indeed, he is exactly the kind of man the founders of the nation worried about when they gave Congress the power to impeach and remove the nation’s chief executive.

Writing in 1792, Alexander Hamilton described the kind of person who could destroy a republic.

When a man unprincipled in private life desperate in his fortune, bold in his temper, possessed of considerable talents, having the advantage of military habits—despotic in his ordinary demeanour—known to have scoffed in private at the principles of liberty—when such a man is seen to mount the hobby horse of popularity—to join in the cry of danger to liberty—to take every opportunity of embarrassing the General Government & bringing it under suspicion—to flatter and fall in with all the non sense of the zealots of the day—It may justly be suspected that his object is to throw things into confusion that he may “ride the storm and direct the whirlwind.”

Aside from the “military habits,” these words describe Donald Trump. He is riding the storm. He is attempting to direct the whirlwind. And that is why he must be impeached, convicted, and removed from office immediately.

Impeachment is not merely a punitive act for past offenses—though Trump richly deserves his punishment—it is a protective measure to guard against further danger. He still possesses immense power. He can still attempt to direct the energies and efforts of the American military or law enforcement to preserve his power. And if he runs for president again, he can drag this country through yet another violent and divisive drama, with unforeseen consequences for the nation.

His behavior remains alarming. He continues to insist that the election was stolen. He was pleased by the disturbance at the Capitol. He banned Vice President Pence’s chief of staff from the White House grounds as retribution for Pence’s alleged disloyalty. A statement from the acting secretary of defense noted that he’d spoken to Pence—not Trump—about restoring order to the besieged Capitol.

Trump alone is a threat to the stability of the country. But he is not alone. External threats remain and the president, so addled and unhinged, is in no position to deal with them should any exigencies arise. America’s enemies seek to weaken us and could well look to take advantage of the chaos in our leadership today. What would Donald Trump do in the face of provocation from Russia, Iran, or North Korea? Would he listen to advisers? Would military leaders listen to him? It’s far too risky to find out.

There are other factors—less tangible, but perhaps just as urgent—to consider. Impeachment and removal with less than two weeks to go in this presidency may seem like a waste of time and energy. And the president, through a spokesman, has committed to an orderly transfer of power. But we think it would be an important act of civic hygiene, sending an important message to future would-be Trumps as well as to the rest of the world. Our image as a shining example of democracy and the rule of law has been covered in filth since the election. Republicans especially have an obligation to make a clear break with this man and this behavior for the good of the country, their historic reputations, and for the viability of a Grand Old Party that has shed any claim to grandness under this president.

Maintaining the honor and integrity of the Party of Lincoln has fallen on too few hands these last four years. Sens. Mitt Romney, Ben Sasse. and Pat Toomey, Reps. Liz Cheney, Adam Kinziger, Mike Gallagher, and others haven’t always spoken out as much as some Trump critics would like, but they have spoken up when it has mattered most, specifically right now. Discarding this president and presidency at the finish line isn’t ideal, and many will say “too little, too late.” But given the stakes, we say, better late than never.

So, we call on the House to impeach President Trump. We call on the Senate to convict him and to disqualify him from holding “any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States.”

We also recognize that the 25th Amendment permits the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet to remove the president if they deem him “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.” If those closest to the president in good faith find that he has become so unmoored from reality that he cannot discharge his duties, as all outward indications would suggest, then they have an obligation to act.

These measures are difficult. They require political courage. Because they require courage, they may be unlikely. But how much violence and chaos must our nation endure before we understand that cowardice has a cost? Trump has abused his office. He has violated the public trust. And now he has incited a violent attack on the Capitol and Congress. He must be removed.

What they're saying: ""Reddit's site-wide policies prohibit content that promotes hate, or encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence against groups of people or individuals. In accordance with this, we have been proactively reaching out to moderators to remind them of our policies and to offer support or resources as needed,"" a spokesperson tells Axios.

""We have also taken action to ban the community r/donaldtrump given repeated policy violations in recent days regarding the violence at the U.S. Capitol.”

The big picture: It's the latest in a string of platforms to take action against Trump's accounts following the historic pro-Trump riot at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday.

Twitch and Snapchat disabled Trump's accounts.

llzop4	republicans	Rush Limbaugh, conservative talk radio pioneer, dead at 70	"Rush Limbaugh, the monumentally influential media icon who transformed talk radio and politics in his decades behind the microphone, helping shape the modern-day Republican Party, died Wednesday morning at the age of 70 after a battle with lung cancer, his family announced.

Limbaugh's wife, Kathryn, made the announcement on his radio show. ""Losing a loved one is terribly difficult, even more so when that loved one is larger than life,"" she said. ""Rush will forever be the greatest of all time.""

The radio icon learned he had Stage IV lung cancer in January 2020 and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by then-President Trump at the State of the Union address days later. First lady Melania Trump then presented America’s highest civilian honor to Limbaugh in an emotional moment on the heels of his devastating cancer diagnosis.

""Rush Limbaugh: Thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our country,"" President Trump said during the address.

He told Fox News on Wednesday afternoon: ""There aren’t too many legends around, but he is a legend.""

It was not clear exactly where Limbaugh died. He frequently broadcast his show from a studio near his home in Palm Beach, Fla.

Limbaugh is considered one of the most influential media figures in American history and has played a consequential role in conservative politics since ""The Rush Limbaugh Show"" began in 1988. Perched behind his Golden EIB (Excellence in Broadcasting) Microphone, Limbaugh spent over three decades as arguably both the most beloved and polarizing person in American media.

The program that began 33 years ago on national syndication with only 56 radio stations grew to be the most listened-to radio show in the United States, airing on more than 600 stations, according to the show’s website. Up to 27 million people tuned in on a weekly basis and Limbaugh has lovingly referred to his passionate fan base as ""Dittoheads,"" as they would often say ""ditto"" when agreeing with the iconic radio host.

In his final radio broadcast of 2020, Limbaugh thanked his listeners and supporters, revealing at the time that he had outlived his prognosis.

""I wasn't expected to be alive today,"" he said. ""I wasn't expected to make it to October, and then to November, and then to December. And yet, here I am, and today, got some problems, but I'm feeling pretty good today.""

Limbaugh helped boost Trump’s influence prior to the 2016 election simply by taking him seriously as a candidate when other established conservatives didn’t want the former reality television star anywhere near the Republican Party. Many of Limbaugh’s listeners eventually became Trump supporters and the radio legend continued to defend Trump throughout his presidency despite occasional disagreements.

In the heat of the 2020 presidential election, Limbaugh hosted Trump in October for what was an unprecedented two-hour ""radio rally"", during which the president was virtually given control of the coveted golden microphone to answer questions from the host and his listeners.

Limbaugh, born in Cape Girardeau, Mo., on Jan. 12, 1951, began his radio career in 1967 as a ""helper"" when he was only 16 years old. He eventually graduated to disk jockey and worked at a small station roughly 100 miles south of St. Louis while attending high school.

""I was totally consumed,"" Limbaugh told the New York Times in 1990, noting that his idol was a Chicago radio host named Larry Lujack. By 1971, Limbaugh was a morning radio host in Pittsburgh, where he was oddly told to cover a certain amount of ""farm news"" because the area was surrounded by many agriculture communities. In 2007 he explained to listeners how the young radio host managed to keep listeners despite the bizarre requirement.

""The last thing that the audience of my show cares about is farm news. If farm news came on, bam! They pushed the button and go somewhere else. So, we had to figure out, ‘Okay, how do we do this and protect the license?’ So I turned the farm news every day into a funny bit with farm sound effects and the roosters crowing and so forth, and I’d make fun of the stockyard feed prices or whatever it was, so that we could say, ‘We’re doing barn news,’ agriculture news. There was all kinds of things like that,"" Limbaugh told listeners.

The tidbit offered a glimpse into Limbaugh’s early days, proving that he was a master of keeping audiences engaged from a young age. Limbaugh has said he realized America was the ""greatest country ever"" when taking trips to Europe and Asia in his late 20s and early 30s, an experience that helped shape his political views.

""I’m aware that the United States is young compared to countries in Europe and Asia that have been around for hundreds of years. They’re thousand-year-old civilizations,"" he told listeners in 2013. ""So, I go to Europe and say, ‘Wait a minute. Why is this bedroom so damned old-fashioned and doesn’t work? What the hell is this? They call this a toilet?’ So I started asking myself, ‘How is it that we, who have only been around 200 years, are light-years ahead of people that have been alive a thousand?’ So, I started thinking this. It was a matter of genuine curiosity to me, and not from a braggadocios standpoint.""

Limbaugh continued the trip down memory lane: ""I was literally interested in how that happened, and then I started to think about all the other things that we led the world in: Manufacturing, technology, innovation, invention, creation, and it all led back to liberty and freedom and the pursuit of happiness and dreams coming true and working hard for whatever you want and being able to do what you love, not just have to dream about it.""

PHOTOS: RUSH LIMBAUGH THROUGH THE YEARS

From that point forward, Limbaugh believed that ""American exceptionalism"" shouldn’t be frowned upon, and his conservative views became more prominent.

""We stood for the concepts that are in our Declaration of Independence: Right to life, liberty, pursuit of happiness. We stood for that, and we were the beacon for it, and to this day that is why the oppressed of the world still seek to come into this country,"" he said.

Limbaugh also credited National Review founder William F. Buckley Jr. for teaching him how to articulate conservative views.

""He single-handedly is responsible for my learning to form and frame my beliefs and express them verbally in a concise and understandable way,"" Limbaugh once said.

In 1987, the Federal Communications Commission repealed the Fairness Doctrine, a policy that had been in place since 1949 and mandated that both sides of controversial political issues receive equal time on radio programs. The decision by the FCC paved the way for Limbaugh to broadcast his conservative views without fear of being punished by the government, quickly leading to the now-prominent talk radio format that he pioneered.

After local radio gigs in Pittsburgh, Kansas City, Sacramento, Limbaugh landed at WABC in New York shortly after the Fairness Doctrine was repealed. It was there that he changed talk radio forever when ""The Rush Limbaugh Show"" became a cultural phenomenon for both the message and the way it was delivered.

""Unlike most radio talkers, who affect a casual, intimate style, Limbaugh sounds like he's on a soapbox. He is intoxicated by words, especially those flowing from his own lips. His vocabulary is extensive; his diction tends to the grandiosely formal, though overblown to the point of self-parody. His nervous energy plays out through hands that never stop moving. They rattle the papers, slap the desk, punch the console. Whap! Whap! Whump! This muted percussion is often heard on the air, a rhythmic accompaniment to Limbaugh's voice,"" author Lewis Grossberger wrote in New York Times Magazine in 1990.

At one point after early struggles to find success in the radio business, Limbaugh temporarily left the industry and worked for the Kansas City Royals baseball team. Lucky for conservatives and ""Dittoheads,"" he eventually returned to radio.

""Thanks for all you’re doing to promote Republican and conservative principles. Now that I’ve retired from active politics, I don’t mind that you have become the Number One voice for conservatism in our country,"" President Ronald Reagan once wrote in a letter to Limbaughthat was published by National Review in 2003.

""I know the liberals call you ‘the most dangerous man in America,’ but don’t worry about it, they used to say the same thing about me. Keep up the good work. America needs to hear the way things ought to be,"" Reagan continued.

Limbaugh was eventually enshrined in the Radio Hall of Fame and the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame. He was a five-time winner of the National Association of Broadcasters Marconi Award for ""Excellence in Syndicated and Network Broadcasting,"" a No. 1 New York Times bestselling author and was named one of Barbara Walters’ 10 Most Fascinating People in 2008 and one of TIME’s 100 Most Influential People in the World in 2009.

While Limbaugh made his career on radio, a speech he delivered at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in 2009 is widely considered one of the most important moments of his career -- an explanation of ""who conservatives are"" that caused the crowd to erupt with chants of ""USA! USA!""

""We love people. When we look out over the United States of America, when we are anywhere, when we see a group of people, such as this or anywhere, we see Americans. We see human beings. We don't see groups. We don't see victims. We don't see people we want to exploit. What we see -- what we see is potential. We do not look out across the country and see the average American, the person that makes this country work. We do not see that person with contempt. We don't think that person doesn't have what it takes. We believe that person can be the best he or she wants to be if certain things are just removed from their path like onerous taxes, regulations and too much government,"" Limbaugh told the crowd.

""We want every American to be the best he or she chooses to be. We recognize that we are all individuals. We love and revere our founding documents, the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence,"" he continued. ""We believe that the preamble to the Constitution contains an inarguable truth that we are all endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights, among them life, liberty, Freedom and the pursuit of happiness.""

In 2001, Limbaugh was diagnosed with an autoimmune inner-ear disease that drastically affected his hearing.

In 2003, Limbaugh checked himself into a treatment facility after becoming addicted to pain medication that he was prescribed following back surgery. Also in 2003, Limbaugh resigned from a brief role as ESPN’s ""Sunday NFL Countdown"" after making controversial comments about then-Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb, who the broadcasting legend said was overrated by media members who wanted to see a Black quarterback thrive.

Limbaugh is survived by his wife.

kfpvbw	republicans	Californians flee state in numbers so great it is projected to lose House seat and electoral vote for first time	"An exodus sparked by high taxes, coronavirus lockdowns, and regulations has driven California’s population growth rate to a record low, which is projected to cost the state a seat in Congress and an electoral vote.

“This is a real sea change in California, which used to be this state of pretty robust population growth,” said Hans Johnson, a demographer at the Public Policy Institute of California, regarding the net migration loss, which has now occurred three years in a row. “It hasn’t been for some time now. But it’s now gotten to the point where the state is essentially not growing population-wise at all.”

According to a population estimate this week , 135,600 more people fled the Golden State than moved there, which marks only the 12th time since 1900 that the state saw a net migration loss. It is the third-largest drop recorded.

Johnson added that the population decrease could cause the state to lose a seat in Congress as well as an Electoral College vote for the first time. The state did not gain any seats following the 2010 census, which was also a first.

Residents have cited high taxes as a main driver of the decision to leave.

“I never wanted to leave California,” San Francisco real estate broker Scott Fuller said about his departure from the state after living there since 1983. “It’s the most beautiful state with the best climate. I think the tipping point was continued tax increases and even more proposed tax increases. ... I have absolutely no regrets.”

Businesses have been fleeing California as well , and just recently, it was learned that tech giants Elon Musk and Larry Ellison were moving their companies, Tesla and Oracle, to more business-friendly states and taking tens of thousands of jobs with them.

Californians have also expressed increased frustration with state and local governments over strict coronavirus lockdowns, evidenced by large protests across the state and a recall effort aimed at removing Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom from office that has gained enough steam to cause his team concern .

The coronavirus pandemic has also forced many in California to work from home, which makes living close to work less important and a potential move easier to commit to, especially when the same salary can be earned in a less expensive state.

“It’s really sped up the out-migration quite a bit,” Fuller said about the shift to remote employment. “People have options now, and you pair that with people’s frustration on several different levels — I don’t see it changing.”

In it, I asked him to consider what effect his plans to narrow the curriculum, slashing the time spent on sports, arts and music, would have on children’s emotional wellbeing. I predicted that his drive to ""improve standards"" might result in a crisis in the mental health of young people. The letter finished:

“I am writing to you, Mr Gove, to beg you not to let the partisan rhetoric that has blighted Tory politics of late filter down to the sphere of young people's education.

""Please stop presenting the situation as a battle between those committed to academic excellence and those with a desire to incorporate lessons relating to the realities of modern life. There is no battle. The future of our young people is too important to create bogus divisions within the education sector for your own political gain.”

Needless to say, my letter went unanswered and my warnings unheeded.

It’s my observation that the world is broadly divided into two types of people: those for whom the link between wellbeing and academic achievement is obvious and therefore requires no explanation and those for whom it is not. And whilst Maslow’s hierarchy of needs tells us that human beings are incapable of learning unless they have their basic needs (which include self-esteem) met, it is an incredibly difficult relationship to measure on the ground.

This is one of the most frustrating things about my job, particularly when I’m met by a hostile geography teacher, seething that my PSHE class has meant their pupils have had to be removed from ""proper"" lessons. Or by a smug MP who insists that if every child can learn a Keats poem by rote by the time they are 14, it will magically lead to more social mobility.

Last week, my Self-Esteem Team attended a lecture at University College London by Martin Seager, who is part of a research team studying male psychology. In it, Seager argued that psychology suffers from ""gender blindness"", in that the profession is reluctant to consider the possibility that men have specific needs. Indeed, Seager argued, we are reluctant to think of men as a gender in their own right at all, thanks to the increasing prevalence of pop-feminism and a widely held and false notion that all men are inherently privileged, regardless of their socio-economic circumstances.

Neglecting boys' needs

The ensuing debate became focused on the under-performance of boys in the classroom compared with girls – why that might be and if it might be attributable to the lack of male teachers, particularly at primary level. That was when my colleague, Grace, passed me a note (retro-style).

Now before, I proceed, here are a few things you need to know about Grace: she has definitely been here before. She has a habit of saying incredibly profound things, and is able to sum up complex situations and the behaviour of others with borderline-frightening succinctness, in a way that makes the listener go all wide-eyed and say: ""Oooh yeeeeeeah."" I’d conservatively estimate that her soul is about 103 years-old. When she goes into schools, she’s regularly mistaken for a pupil, being as she is teeny tiny, with a youthful face and sense of style, but you should never underestimate her. She has your number. She is basically Yoda but less green and wrinkly.

The note said: “Isn’t it just that boys underperform because we look after their wellbeing less?”

It was a lightbulb moment. Afterwards, we discussed the numerous occasions we have visited schools and a decision has been made to divide the year group by gender, the girls coming with us for a lesson on mental health, body image or self-esteem and the boys being sent to have a lecture on not being sexist. Because apparently boys do not have brains or bodies, only an inbuilt penchant for misogyny.

The tide is turning. We are beginning to understand that boys have emotional needs too; they might be distinct from those of their female peers and they might be less able to articulate them. But in the meantime, if you want evidence that wellbeing programmes within schools have a direct impact on academic performance, look no further than the exam results of boys.

l0230j	republicans	The Trump Impeachment Is Deeply Flawed, but He Deserves Conviction	"(Joshua Roberts/Reuters)

Congressional Democrats politicized the legitimate case for removing the president. Censure is now the best option.

So what would I do if I had to vote on impeachment in the Senate?

From the first, I’ve described President Trump’s behavior on January 6 as impeachable — particularly in the context of what went on in the weeks since the election, but even without that. I was not trying to be cute. I have been wrestling with the wisdom of proceeding with impeachment due to the lateness of Trump’s term. But I would not call something impeachable unless it was serious enough to be condemnable by conviction, removal, and disqualification. Indeed, I have written a book about impeachment, Faithless Execution, in which I argued that several actions taken by President Obama were impeachable. None of them was as egregious as what President Trump did — and, especially, what he omitted to do — nine days ago.

Alas, whether serious executive misconduct warrants conviction by the Senate by the constitutionally required two-thirds’ supermajority vote is not solely controlled by the question of whether the conduct in question is impeachable. This is why I can’t bring the same clarity as such friends and colleagues as Ramesh Ponnuru, Matthew Continetti, Kevin D. Williamson, and Jay Nordlinger, for whom the imperative to convict, remove, and disqualify Trump is more obvious. I ultimately agree with them, but let me try to explain why I’m having a harder time with it.

Impeachment Is a Political Process

Advertisement

I argued in Faithless Execution that the question of whether to impeach and remove a president is a political one, not a legal one. That is, the fact that a president engages in grave misconduct that qualifies as impeachable does not settle the question whether that president should, in fact, be removed.

The Framers saw impeachment as essential to the checks and balances that create the equilibrium they were trying to establish between and among the central government’s three branches. President-elect Biden’s recent meanderings on the subject notwithstanding, the branches are not “co-equal” — Congress was supposed to have pride of place, though not so much so that it could dominate the executive. The Framers worried that the presidency could transform into something closer to a monarchy, and that certain varieties of presidential treachery — e.g., a president covertly working with foreign powers against the United States — could destroy the republic.

To endow Congress with impeachment power was thus deemed “indispensable” by Madison. Though it has turned out to be a historical rarity, the Framers expected that impeachment would be invoked with more regularity.

Advertisement

Nevertheless, because they similarly feared Congress’s potential accumulation of tyrannical power were it to be given too potent a check, the Framers made impeachment very hard to do. The simple-majority-vote trigger in the House means that any grave presidential misconduct can readily be alleged as an impeachable act; but the mandatory two-thirds-vote in the Senate ensures that impeachment-and-removal will not take place unless the misconduct is so grave that a consensus of the nation, cutting across partisan and ideological lines, is established that the president must be expelled.

Whether an impeachable offense warrants removal is about much more than whether it is impeachable per se — or even whether it is patently disqualifying. The political component of impeachment very much includes whether the nation strongly supports removal, versus whether removal is apt to intensify national strife. The supermajority removal requirement was intended to forestall the potential for impeachment driven mainly by partisanship — to discourage the House from impeaching unless there was at least a real possibility, if not a probability, that the Senate would convict. Not least, there is another consideration: A president who is impeached but acquitted may be emboldened to abuse power, rather than tamed.

For these and other reasons, I argued that Obama should not be impeached despite my belief that he had committed serious misconduct that profoundly threatened both the Constitution’s framework (e.g., by usurping legislative power) and national security (e.g., by empowering Iran, the world’s leading state sponsor of anti-American terrorism). I don’t pretend to be politically neutral, but political leanings are inevitable, and thus part of the reason why impeachment-and-removal is, and should be, a near-insuperable hurdle. If it is done prematurely, driven by partisan animus (or at least perceived to be), or based on flimsy grounds, it will do more harm than good and set the country on a banana-republic style trajectory of strife, instability, and upheaval.

Incitement and the Question of Whether a Prosecutable Crime Is Necessary

Kevin Williamson could not be more right that it is unnecessary to have a penal offense prosecutable in criminal court in order to have high crimes and misdemeanors, the Constitution’s standard for an impeachable offense. But he overstates the case when he argues that the lack of a chargeable crime “is immaterial to the question of impeachment.”

Since we are dealing with a political judgment as to which two-thirds of the Senate must agree, it makes a significant difference whether it can be argued that others who did what the president has done would be prosecuted — i.e., that the presidency is operating as a shield that puts the president above the law. Moreover, there are prominent politicians and the occasional scholar who contend that a crime is necessary for misconduct to rise to impeachment-level gravity. The fact that they are wrong about that does not mean they believe it any less — and they, too, are part of the public who need to be persuaded.

This, along with my background as a prosecutor, is why I have been intently focused on the formal allegation and the text of the impeachment article, entitled “incitement to insurrection” (see here, here and here). Pace Kevin, I think it is relevant (not dispositive, but relevant) that Trump could not conceivably be convicted of incitement. That is so even if we stipulate that he demagogically stoked the crowd to descend on the Capitol, and thus did incite it in the common usage of that word as opposed to its more narrow, First Amendment–confined meaning, which requires an unambiguous call for violence that creates an imminent, probable threat of violence.

My “convict now” friends are also right that what happened at the Capitol is properly described as an insurrection. I don’t think the matter is as clear as they seem to, but that’s not important in what is a political process, not a legal one. Yet, there are important political considerations in this regard, which are separate from judgments about Trump’s misconduct, namely, the double standard and the Democrats’ motive.

Insurrection

Insurrection cannot be a politicized concept, such that whether it’s been committed or not depends on whether the violent mob includes Trump supporters whom Democrats despise or “racial-justice protesters” whom they lionize. Impeachment is about more than the president; it is about social cohesion. Condemning Trump after months of turning a blind eye to rampant insurrectionist violence — during which Democrats and the Left explicitly objected to invocation of the Insurrection Act to restore order — is going to make a lot of the country very angry. And I am not talking about miscreants who would storm the Capitol. I am talking about people of good will who are convinced that our institutions are cratering, and with them our society, because our leaders so fear the radical Left and its propensity to take it to the streets when things don’t go its way.

This not a sufficient reason to exonerate Trump. Two wrongs don’t make a right: You don’t cure the problem by ignoring what was, in fact, an insurrection at the Capitol. Righteous anger over the double-standard would, however, have been a good reason for the House to avoid making insurrection the gravamen of its impeachment article.

Moreover, Republicans cannot be expected to ignore that the Democrats intentionally highlighted insurrection, in part, because they are laying the groundwork for an invocation of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Section Three disqualification clause. As Dan McLaughlin has explained, Democrats and progressive scholars would like to use Section 3 to disqualify other Republicans besides Trump.

The Democrats’ political narrative is that the violence at the Capitol was caused not only by the president but by Republicans in the House and Senate (about 150 in all) who supported Trump’s campaign to pressure Vice President Pence and Congress to refuse to acknowledge Biden’s state-certified Electoral College victory. Constitutionally speaking, this was indefensible on the part of participating Republicans. But that does not make them abettors of the storming of the Capitol, which endangered them as much as the other lawmakers. I remain baffled that these Republicans clung to their untenable position even after the siege. Still, they do not warrant Fourteenth Amendment disqualification gambits, and Democrats have undermined the impeachment effort by transparently encouraging such gambits. Rest assured: the lawsuits are coming.

How Impeachment Should Have Been Framed:

Dereliction of Duty

What should the House impeachment resolution have looked like?

Though impeachment is not a criminal case, it is still about persuasion. An able prosecutor would focus on what cannot credibly be denied and on what righteously inflames people. More arguable or dubious issues should fade to the background — you get what advantage you can out of them while making sure the jury understands they are not make-or-break.

With that in mind, Trump committed two very clear impeachable offenses.

First, he was derelict in his duty as president and commander-in-chief by failing to take any action — indeed, by turning a deaf ear to pleas that he take action — when the seat of the United States government was stormed and lives were in jeopardy, particularly the lives of security personnel, members of Congress, and Trump’s own vice president.

Second, he betrayed his duty to preserve, protect, and defend the United States Constitution by pressuring his vice president and members of Congress to violate their Twelfth Amendment duty to preside over the counting of the states’ electoral votes — in the process, undermining state sovereignty over elections, an aspect of the Constitution’s federalism principles that the president is also duty-bound to uphold.

Pleading the case this way would have had several benefits.

It would have made Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who was murdered, the face of impeachment. An impeachment manager opening the presentation to the Senate could have declared without hesitation: “When Officer Sicknick needed a president, Donald Trump was missing in action. When America needed a commander-in-chief to protect the seat of its democracy, Donald Trump wouldn’t be disturbed — he was busy watching television.”

Focusing the case on what the president was doing, and willfully failing to do, while Officer Sicknick was killed, other Capitol police were assaulted (at least one other of them savagely so), and the lives of the vice president and the people’s representatives were imperiled, would have framed the case around misconduct (1) as to which there is no factual defense or legal ambiguity; and (2) which would powerfully illustrate the danger of maintaining the president in office, even for a few more days. Contrary to what the House passed, to frame the case this way would have made it much harder for Senate Republicans to decline to reconvene for an immediate trial.

Advertisement

Next, I want to return to Kevin’s point about the fact that impeachment does not require an indictable offense. As explicated by Hamilton, impeachment is more resonant of military than civilian justice. There may not be a civilian crime here, but dereliction of duty is a serious offense under military law. During a forcible siege against the seat of government, it is inexcusable in a commander-in-chief. The fact that an American military commander would be severely disciplined for what the president did makes the impeachment case stronger.

Constructing the case as I suggest would also have diminished the legal significance of incitement and insurrection. Instead of playing defense — Can the president be said to have committed “incitement” consistent with federal law and First Amendment protection of political speech? — the prosecution would be playing offense: Regardless of whether the president is guilty of incitement, he is even more culpable for failing to respond to the siege because he urged people to march on the Capitol and to pressure those inside — and, in fact, publicly rebuked the vice president even as he knew people were marching on the Capitol. (See Jim Geraghty’s report.)

Furthermore, as Rich Lowry detailed in his column on Friday, reports indicate that the violence at the Capitol started before Trump was done speaking at the Ellipse. If the key question were whether the president incited the crowd, this fact would be highly pertinent. It is largely irrelevant, though, if the issue is how the commander-in-chief responded once he became aware of the violence.

It doesn’t matter, as some in the administration now half-heartedly claim, that the president had earlier in the week green-lighted any necessary armed forces deployment to support civilian law-enforcement and the Capitol. He became aware of the siege in real time and he abdicated — leaving it to the vice president to attempt to fill the void by spurring the Pentagon to action (though Pence technically lacked that authority). The president’s performance is inexcusable. People, including Officer Sicknick, were killed and injured while Trump dithered — and, according to some reports, reveled in his supporters’ zeal to fight for him. It is beside the point whether the siege is best described an insurrection, a riot, a protest run amok, etc.

Subversion of the Constitution’s Election Process

It is impossible to assess the president’s dereliction independent of its context. Trump and his supporters touted the rally on the Capitol days in advance in order to intensify pressure on Pence and congressional Republicans to abdicate their constitutional duty to preside over the counting of the states’ electoral votes and acknowledge Biden as the winner of the election. And this itself came in the broader context of the president’s agitation of his supporters by making inflammatory statements about the election, many of which were either blatantly false or recklessly indifferent about their inaccuracy.

In the constitutional system that the president is sworn to preserve, protect, and defend, the states are sovereign on the matter of conducting and certifying their elections. To the extent the states are bound to comply with the Constitution, the president had a full and fair opportunity to contest that question in federal court — and, for the most part, his legal team folded when federal judges invited them to prove their extravagant allegations of fraud, rigging, and constitutional violations.

It was perfectly appropriate for the president to rely on his legal right to seek recounts and contest state election procedures. It is inexcusable, however, for the president to have tried to induce the vice president and congressional Republicans to violate their sworn constitutional duties. That in itself is worthy of an impeachment article.

Guilty or Not Guilty?

To summarize, my problem with the impeachment article the House has lodged against the president is that it is ill-considered, legally dubious, politically motivated, deeply divisive, and calculated as a first salvo in targeting Republicans other than President Trump for disqualification from public office.

That said, this is not a legal trial, but a political one. I cannot say that the president did not “incite an insurrection” as that phrase is commonly understood. Despite that, I would still be inclined to vote to acquit, except for one inescapable fact: Impeachable conduct for which condemnation is warranted did in fact occur. Since the animating issue here is whether the president of the United States merits removal and disqualification for the good of the nation, rather than whether he has received model due process, I would vote to convict, my deep reservations about the impeachment article notwithstanding.

What Should Happen?

I don’t agree with Senator Mitch McConnell’s judgment that it would be — or at least would have been — impossible to conduct a Senate impeachment trial with adequate due process prior to the conclusion of the president’s term. As Rich and I have discussed on our podcast, due process is the process that is due under the circumstances. In impeachment, due process is an aspiration; the national security of the United States is the imperative.

If we woke up one morning to smoking-gun, undeniable proof that an American president was a spy for a foreign adversary, Congress would have to impeach and remove the president immediately. The 25th Amendment, which allows for instantaneously suspending the president’s authority, would have no bearing on a situation that did not involve a severe health-related disability. And the protection of the republic would demand swift impeachment and removal. No one in his right mind would say, “Let’s leave a foreign spy in the Oval Office for a few more weeks so we can have some hearings and make sure the Senate trial is fair.”

Those who have urged that, after the events of January 6, the president cannot be trusted with our security — the president’s highest obligation — have a point. The Senate should have reconvened to conduct the trial, an outcome the House might have persuasively pushed for had Democrats not so patently politicized an impeachment that should and could have won broader bipartisan support.

At this point, I fear it would be counterproductive to have a Senate trial. In five days, the president will no longer be in office. If he is tried after he is out of office, the Senate will have to suspend business at a time when the new administration is not yet fully set up, and foreign adversaries may see that as an opportunity to make mischief. With no urgency to have a rapid trial since Trump will already be gone, there will be much less justification for limiting due process to a minimum. The proceedings will be more drawn out than they should be.

More to the point, the high probability is that Trump would be acquitted.

As noted above, impeachment is meant to be very difficult. Here, beyond that, Republicans have been given at least four reasons to vote against conviction: (1) the profound constitutional question of whether a president already out of office may properly be tried (I am in the camp that says a removed official may be impeached, tried, and disqualified, but it is a disputed issue); (2) the afore-described manner in which the article of impeachment was poorly drafted and rashly adopted; (3) the lack of overwhelming consensus in the country that Trump should be convicted and disqualified; and (d) the blatant partisanship of the House impeachment proceedings, including the fact that the first impeachment was unserious and the current one lays the groundwork to seek disqualification of Republicans other than Trump under the Fourteenth Amendment.

Consequently, the main effects of a Senate impeachment trial would be to keep Trump in the limelight, playing the martyr, and then to enable him to claim vindication when he is acquitted. That would make him more likely to mount an audacious 2024 campaign. I don’t believe he could succeed in retaking the presidency, but he could be destructive of Republican and conservative prospects.

Under the circumstances, the best thing for the country would be a bicameral, bipartisan resolution of censure that compellingly summarized and condemned the president’s misconduct. The Senate could then agree not to proceed with a trial. Trump would remain the only president ever impeached twice, and the censure would stand as an emphatic verdict of history. The country could move on from this sorry chapter, rather than enhancing Donald Trump’s relevance and setting the stage for him, perversely, to claim victory."	right

k8r7nb	republicans	BREAKING: Ted Cruz to argue the Pennsylvania election case before the Supreme Court	"







If the Supreme Court takes up the Pennsylvania election case from Congressman Mike Kelly and Sean Parnell, Senator Ted Cruz will be the one arguing the case before the high court:

If #SCOTUS grants cert in the PA election case, I have told the petitioners I will stand ready to present the oral argument. Full statement below… pic.twitter.com/EnHxjqGR5K — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) December 7, 2020







Ted Cruz last week urged the high court to take up the case:

Because of the importance of the legal issues presented, I've publicly urged #SCOTUS to hear the case brought by Congressman Mike Kelly, congressional candidate Sean Parnell & state rep. candidate Wanda Logan challenging the constitutionality of the POTUS election results in PA. — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) December 7, 2020

Petitioners’ legal team has asked me whether I would be willing to argue the case before #SCOTUS, if the Court grants certiorari. I have agreed, and told them that, if the Court takes the appeal, I will stand ready to present the oral argument. — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) December 7, 2020

As I said last week, the bitter division and acrimony we see across the Nation needs resolution. I believe #SCOTUS has a responsibility to the American People to ensure, within its powers, that we are following the law and following the Constitution. — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) December 7, 2020

Just yesterday, Justice Alito moved the deadline for a response from Pennsylvania officials from Wednesday to tomorrow morning at 9am. So I would expect that some time tomorrow we will hear whether the Supreme Court has taken up the case or not."	right

“McCarthy told all members on the call that he has been receiving FBI briefings and it is clear that antifa was not behind this,” one source familiar with the call said. “That it was in fact right-wing extremists and QAnon adherents, and he urged members to stop spreading false information to the contrary.”

In excerpts of the stunning one-hour phone call Saturday, Trump lambasted his fellow Republican for refusing to falsely say that he won the election in Georgia and repeatedly touted baseless claims of election fraud.

""The people of Georgia are angry, the people of the country are angry. And there's nothing wrong with saying that, you know, um, that you've recalculated,"" Trump said in one part of the call. Raffensperger responded, ""Well, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is, the data you have is wrong.""

In another part, Trump said, ""So look. All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state.""

""You should want to have an accurate election. And you're a Republican,"" Trump said at one point.

jb6mzy	republicans	Smoking-gun email reveals how Hunter Biden introduced Ukrainian businessman to VP dad	"Hunter Biden introduced his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, to a top executive at a Ukrainian energy firm less than a year before the elder Biden pressured government officials in Ukraine into firing a prosecutor who was investigating the company, according to emails obtained by The Post.

The never-before-revealed meeting is mentioned in a message of appreciation that Vadym Pozharskyi, an adviser to the board of Burisma, allegedly sent Hunter Biden on April 17, 2015, about a year after Hunter joined the Burisma board at a reported salary of up to $50,000 a month.

“Dear Hunter, thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together. It’s realty [sic] an honor and pleasure,” the email reads.

An earlier email from May 2014 also shows Pozharskyi, reportedly Burisma’s No. 3 exec, asking Hunter for “advice on how you could use your influence” on the company’s behalf.

The blockbuster correspondence — which flies in the face of Joe Biden’s claim that he’s “never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings” — is contained in a massive trove of data recovered from a laptop computer.

The computer was dropped off at a repair shop in Biden’s home state of Delaware in April 2019, according to the store’s owner.

Other material extracted from the computer includes a raunchy, 12-minute video that appears to show Hunter, who’s admitted struggling with addiction problems, smoking crack while engaged in a sex act with an unidentified woman, as well as numerous other sexually explicit images.

The customer who brought in the water-damaged MacBook Pro for repair never paid for the service or retrieved it or a hard drive on which its contents were stored, according to the shop owner, who said he tried repeatedly to contact the client.

The shop owner couldn’t positively identify the customer as Hunter Biden, but said the laptop bore a sticker from the Beau Biden Foundation, named after Hunter’s late brother and former Delaware attorney general.

Photos of a Delaware federal subpoena given to The Post show that both the computer and hard drive were seized by the FBI in December, after the shop’s owner says he alerted the feds to their existence.

But before turning over the gear, the shop owner says, he made a copy of the hard drive and later gave it to former Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s lawyer, Robert Costello.

Steve Bannon, former adviser to President Trump, told The Post about the existence of the hard drive in late September and Giuliani provided The Post with a copy of it on Sunday.

Less than eight months after Pozharskyi thanked Hunter Biden for the introduction to his dad, the then-vice president admittedly pressured Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk into getting rid of Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin by threatening to withhold a $1 billion US loan guarantee during a December 2015 trip to Kiev.

“I looked at them and said: I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money,” Biden infamously bragged to the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018.

“Well, son of a bitch. He got fired.”

Shokin has said that at the time of his firing, in March 2016, he’d made “specific plans” to investigate Burisma that “included interrogations and other crime-investigation procedures into all members of the executive board, including Hunter Biden.”

Joe Biden has insisted that the US wanted Shokin removed over corruption concerns, which were shared by the European Union.

Meanwhile, an email dated May 12, 2014 — shortly after Hunter Biden joined the Burisma board — shows Pozharskyi attempting to get him to use his political leverage to help the company.

The message had the subject line “urgent issue” and was also sent to Hunter Biden’s business partner, Devon Archer, who also sat on the Burisma board at the time.

Pozharskyi said that “the representatives of new authorities in power tend to quite aggressively approach N. Z. unofficially with the aim to obtain cash from him.”

N.Z. isn’t identified in the email but appears to be a reference to Burisma founder Mykola Zlochevsky, whose first name is a Ukrainian version of “Nicholas.”

When the alleged shakedown failed, “they proceeded with concrete actions” in the form of “one or more pretrial proceedings,” Pozharskyi wrote.

“We urgently need your advice on how you could use your influence to convey a message / signal, etc .to stop what we consider to be politically motivated actions,” he added.

Hunter Biden responded by saying he was with Archer in Doha, Qatar, and asked for more information about “the formal (if any) accusations being made against Burisma.”

“Who is ultimately behind these attacks on the company? Who in the current interim government could put an end to such attacks?” he added.

The exchange came the same day that Burisma announced it had expanded its board of directors by adding Hunter Biden, who was put in charge of its “legal unit and will provide support for the Company among international organizations,” according to a news release that’s since been scrubbed from Burisma’s website.

Hunter Biden actually joined the board in April 2014, according to multiple reports.

His lawyer said last year that Hunter was “not a member of the management team,” adding, “At no time was Hunter in charge of the company’s legal affairs.”

About four months after Hunter Biden’s correspondence with Pozharskyi, Archer forwarded Hunter Biden an email chain with the subject line “tax raise impact on Burisma production,” which included Pozharskyi saying that the Ukrainian cabinet had submitted new tax legislation to the country’s parliament.

“If enacted, this law would kill the entire private gas production sector in the bud,” Pozharskyi wrote.

In the Sept. 24, 2014, email, Pozharskyi also said he was “going to share this information with the US embassy here in Kyiv, as well as the office of Mr Amos Hochstein in the States.”

At the time, Hochstein was the State Department’s newly appointed special envoy and coordinator for international energy ­affairs.

In December 2017, the Naftogaz Group, Ukraine’s state-owned energy company, announced that Hochstein had joined the company as an independent director, but on Monday he announced his ­resignation.

“The company has been forced to spend endless amounts of time combating political pressure and efforts by oligarchs to enrich themselves through questionable transactions,” Hochstein wrote in an op-ed published by the Kyiv Post.

In addition to denying that’s he’s spoken to Hunter Biden about his overseas business dealings, Joe Biden has repeatedly denied any conflict of interest or wrongdoing by either of them involving ­Burisma.

Last February, he got testy during an appearance on NBC’s “Today” show when co-host Savannah Guthrie questioned whether it was “wrong for [Hunter] to take that position, knowing that it was really because that company wanted access to you.”

“Well, that’s not true. You’re saying things you do not know what you’re talking about,” the elder Biden responded.

Last December, Joe Biden also lashed out during a Democratic primary town hall event in Iowa, where a man accused him of sending Hunter to Ukraine “to get a job and work for a gas company, he had no experience with gas or nothing, in order to get access to . . . the president.”

“You’re a damn liar, man. That’s not true and no one has ever said that,” Biden fumed.

Biden then continued berating the man as he stepped forward, called the man “fat” and challenged him to “do push-ups together, man.”

The FBI referred questions about its seizure of the laptop and hard drive to the Delaware US Attorney’s Office, where a spokesperson said, “My office can neither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation.”

Hunter Biden’s lawyer refused to comment on the specifics but instead attacked Giuliani.

“He has been pushing widely discredited conspiracy theories about the Biden family, openly relying on actors tied to Russian intelligence,” the lawyer, George R. Mesires, said of Giuliani.

Pozharskyi and the Joe Biden campaign did not return requests for comment. Hochstein could not be reached.

lfjch5	republicans	Rob Schneider mocks California voters: ‘Would vote for a bowl of s—- if it had D next to it’	"Actor Rob Schneider one-upped House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about the mentality of Democratic voters. And added an obscenity.

The former “Saturday Night Live” comic disparaged deep-blue California’s electorate in the context of commenting on an article about “the Left’s ignorance of Stalin’s tyranny.”

“Unfortunately, people in California would vote for a bowl of s—t if it had ‘D’ next to it,” he tweeted.

Mr. Schneider himself spelled out the obscene term.

Last spring, Mrs. Pelosi disparaged the victory of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in a New York congressional district, saying a “glass of water with a D next to its name” would win her district.

Mr. Schneider’s tweet prompted some laughter and pushback. One Twitter user replied with “checks out” and a picture of Gov. Gavin Newsom.

l71x7y	republicans	Biedermann Files Bill to Allow Texans to Vote on Secession, or 'Texit'	"“At the general election to be held November 2, 2021, the voters shall be permitted to vote in a referendum on the question of whether this state should leave the United States of America and establish an independent republic.”

That’s the idea proposed by state Rep. Kyle Biedermann (R-Fredericksburg), who has kept his promise to file legislation that would let the citizens of Texas choose a path back to 1836. House Bill (HB) 1359, dubbed “The Texan Independence Referendum Act,” would give Texans a choice on whether or not to secede.

“This is not a resolution to allow for immediate independence,” Biedermann’s office emphasized in a press release. “This legislation will give power directly to the people via referendum and allow Texans the right to discuss, debate and vote on creating a path toward Texas Independence.”

Even though the Republican Party of Texas names the right to secede as a plank in the party platform, Biedermann’s proposal exposed fault lines that commonly widen between wings of the party at the state level. State Rep. Jeff Leach (R-Plano) called the referendum “un-American.”

“Based on what you’ve said the bill does, it seems like the most anti-American bill I’ve seen in my 4+ terms in the Texas House,” Leach tweeted.

“It’s a disgrace to the Lone Star State. The very definition of seditious. A true embarrassment. And you should be ashamed of yourself for filing it.”

The bill derives authority from the first two sections of the Texas Constitution. Section 1 declares Texas to be “a free and independent State, subject only to the Constitution of the United States, and the maintenance of our free institutions and the perpetuity of the Union depend upon the preservation of the right of local self-government, unimpaired to all the States.”

Section 2 enshrines the right of Texans to overhaul their government:

“All political power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority, and instituted for their benefit… they have at all times the inalienable right to alter, reform or abolish their government in such manner as they may think expedient.”

The official filing of the referendum bill has quickened the long-dormant news watch of the Texas Nationalist Movement, the state’s largest pro-secession group. The organization previously pinned its hopes on Rep. James White’s (R-Hillister) expected referendum bill in 2013, though the legislation ended up as a simpler affirmation of Texas’ 10th Amendment that only hinted at secession and included no referendum or clear path towards it. Biedermann’s bill would authorize a referendum vote this November and establish a committee to disentangle Texas from the United States.

The lieutenant governor, the speaker of the Texas house, and four members from each chamber would make up the committee."	right

jp64cw	republicans	Joe Biden will be the forty-sixth president of the United States. Kamala Harris will be the forty-eighth vice president. It’s over.	"Posted 1pm UK time

As we watched initial results come in on election night, pundit after pundit declared this year’s polls to be the worst in recent history. Such proclamations were likely premature. We will have to wait until counting is completed in all battleground states before we make any concrete judgement, but it is already looking far from the industry-wide disaster some have gleefully portrayed it as.

In the state of Florida, the final count is likely to be within five points of the FiveThirtyEight average. That’s not great, but it’s also not exactly terrible. Whatever the result in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, the averages there were easily within the standard margin of error. We will have to wait on Pennsylvania, but the error there will also not be as bad as initially feared. The biggest miss so far appears to be in Wisconsin, where the polls still predicted a Joe Biden win. Don’t get me wrong, I firmly believe that polling success should be judged on the margins, not the predicted winner, but unfortunately that’s not how narratives are often formed.

Once counting is complete, expect a more detailed breakdown on the subject (hopefully next week). For now, I will leave you with this.

To me, the point of bringing up Joe Biden’s massive polling lead was never to predict that he was going to win big. Instead, it was to say that he could withstand even a major polling error in Donald Trump’s direction. It would seem he did."	right

mjzgln	republicans	Charles Barkley says politicians 'divide and conquer' based on race to 'keep their grasp on money and power'	"Charles Barkley says politicians seek to divide people based on race to ""keep their grasp on money and power.""

Barkley, a former athlete who is an analyst on Inside the NBA, said he finds ""most white people and black people are great people,"" but politicians benefit by pitting them against one another.

""I think our system is set up where our politicians, whether they're Republicans or Democrats, are designed to make us not like each other, so they can keep their grasp [on] money and power,"" he said during a CBS broadcast prior to Saturday evening's March Madness games. ""They divide and conquer.""

SOCIALIST DEPUTY MAYOR OF PARIS SAYS WHITE PEOPLE SHOULD 'BE ASKED TO KEEP QUIET' ON RACE ISSUES

Barkley said politicians don't have to live with the consequences of racial division because they don't live in the neighborhoods affected by their actions.

""We are so stupid, following our politicians, whether they are Republicans or Democrats, and their only job is, 'Hey, let's make these people not like each other. We don't live in their neighborhoods. We've all got money. Let's make the whites and blacks not like each other. Let's make rich people and poor people not like each other. Let's scramble the middle class.' I truly believe that in my heart,"" he added.

The subjects of race and diversity have gained renewed scrutiny in the wake of a new voting law in Georgia that critics argue will hamper voting access for racial minorities.

""There is no middle ground here. You either are for more people voting, or you want to suppress the vote,"" Kenneth Chenault, a former chief executive of American Express, said while pressuring Georgia-based corporations to oppose the new legislation. ""This impacts all Americans, but we also need to acknowledge the history of voting rights for African-Americans. And as African American executives in corporate America, what we were saying is we want corporate America to understand that, and we want them to work with us.""

Many corporations with ties to the state issued statements condemning the new law, and Major League Baseball announced on Friday that it would move its All-Star Game and 2021 draft from Atlanta in protest, a move celebrated by many on the Left, including former President Barack Obama.

""Home run,"" actress Ellen Barkin tweeted in response to the news.

kw3h25	republicans	McConnell is said to be pleased about impeachment, believing it will be easier to purge Trump from the G.O.P.	"Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, has told associates that he believes President Trump committed impeachable offenses and that he is pleased that Democrats are moving to impeach him, believing that it will make it easier to purge him from the party, according to people familiar with his thinking. The House is voting on Wednesday to formally charge Mr. Trump with inciting violence against the country.

At the same time, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader and one of Mr. Trump’s most steadfast allies in Congress, has asked other Republicans whether he should call on Mr. Trump to resign in the aftermath of the riot at the Capitol last week, according to three Republican officials briefed on the conversations.

While Mr. McCarthy has said he is personally opposed to impeachment, he and other party leaders have decided not to formally lobby Republicans to vote “no,” and an aide to Mr. McCarthy said he was open to a measure censuring Mr. Trump for his conduct. In private, Mr. McCarthy reached out to a leading House Democrat to see if the chamber would be willing to pursue a censure vote, though Speaker Nancy Pelosi has ruled it out.

Taken together, the stances of Congress’s two top Republicans — neither of whom has said publicly that Mr. Trump should resign or be impeached — reflected the politically challenging and fast-moving nature of the crisis that the party faces after the assault by a pro-Trump mob during a session to formalize President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s electoral victory."	right
ku5eg1	republicans	‘Last Tweet’: Greg Gutfeld Joins Rush Limbaugh, Mark Levin, Lou Dobbs In Leaving Twitter	"Fox News host Greg Gutfeld joined other prominent conservative voices on Saturday by abandoning his Twitter account after the social media platform permanently banned President Donald Trump.

“To be true to the resolution to myself: this is my last tweet. [O]ther than to read news, [I won’t] be on [T]witter,” Gutfeld first tweeted on Jan. 2. Offering the link to his own website, Gutfeld continued, “[Y]ou’re all invited there; just leave the bullshit behind. Tata.”

If you wish to contact me, join https://t.co/vNvxXtFyey – which is over at locals. you're all invited there; just leave the bullshit behind. Tata. — GregGutfeld (@greggutfeld) January 3, 2021

On Saturday, after Twitter had banned the president and seemingly began purging the followers of conservative accounts, Gutfeld returned for a final sign-off. “[O]kay, this IS my last tweet: CNN tries to get FNC banned. Apple targets Parler. Publishers dump writers. [M]usic labels drop artists. [T]witter bans/removes thousands. [T]ech companies join hands. [T]his redefines who the true rebels are.”

“[I]f you like the purge, you’re the servant,” Gutfeld added.

tech companies join hands. this redefines who the true rebels are. if you like the purge, you're the servant. — GregGutfeld (@greggutfeld) January 9, 2021

After many conservative accounts apparently hemorrhaged followers after the president’s ban, Fox News reported:

“Fox & Friends” co-host Pete Hegseth on Saturday described it as “something of a purge” that might have taken place, as thousands of users disappeared from the platform. Hegseth also suggested that the move might have come after the Georgia Senate runoff results earlier this week, not just after Trump’s account was permanenty suspended. The exact reason for the shift in users is not known, but it could be that users have voluntarily left the platform along with the president. Fox News reached out to Twitter for comment on the drop in users and was referred to their support page. A follow-up request was not yet returned.

Gutfeld follows in the footsteps of fellow Fox hosts Lou Dobbs and Mark Levin, both of whom left Twitter following the company’s muzzling of the president.

“I don’t believe any American should ever tolerate those who deny us freedom of speech or who would ever be so arrogant as to censor our President,” Dobbs tweeted Friday. “I’m withdrawing from Twitter as of right now.” He urged his followers to join him on Parler.

I don't believe any American should ever tolerate those who deny us freedom of speech or who would ever be so arrogant as to censor our President. I'm withdrawing from Twitter as of right now. Please join me on Parler @LouDobbsTonight. God bless you and America. — Lou Dobbs (@LouDobbs) January 9, 2021

Hours earlier, radio host Mark Levin suspended himself from the platform. “I have suspended my own Twitter account in protest against Twitter’s fascism,” Levin said. “I ask all my followers to join me now on Parler and Rumble.”

Radio host Rush Limbaugh also apparently deactivated his Twitter account after Trump was banned. As The Daily Wire reported:

Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh reportedly deleted his Twitter account shortly after President Donald Trump was banned from the platform on Friday night. The link to Limbaugh’s account, which had amassed more than half a million followers before being deleted, now leads to a page that reads: “This account doesn’t exist[.] Try searching for another.” Rumors swirled that Twitter had suspended the account, but a spokesperson for Twitter told both CNN reporter Oliver Darcy and Fox News reporter Joseph Wulfsohn that whoever controls the account deactivated it. “A Twitter spokesperson tells me the company did not suspend Rush Limbaugh’s account. In other words, it appears Limbaugh (or someone acting on his behalf) deactivated it,” Darcy tweeted. Wulfsohn tweeted, “Twitter SPOX: ‘I would like to correct that He is not suspended. The user deactivated their account.’”

kk493r	republicans	Sen. Rand Paul: Governors Should Never Have Been Allowed to Become 'Dictators'	"Sen. Rand Paul: Governors Should Never Have Been Allowed to Become ‘Dictators’

In an early morning Christmas Day interview, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said that governors should never have been allowed to accumulate so much power that they can lock down the economy.

“You know, nobody ever intended that governors would be sort of czars or dictators in charge of the economy,” Paul said. “In my state, you can’t have indoor dining, you can’t have outdoor dining, and your kids are not in school. We’re worse than New York City right now. In Kentucky, our governor has shut the schools down even though all of the science shows that—and all of the evidence—that you really aren’t having a surge when you have the schools open,” he added.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear has had pandemic restrictions in place, some of which include a mask mandate, limiting private gathering sizes to small groups, minimal capacity for indoor small businesses like gyms, carry-out dining only, and no onsite schools.

Many governors across the United States have locked down (to varying degrees), their small businesses due to surges in the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus cases among their residents. States have felt pushback from citizens and small business owners who say they are in financial crisis and need to make a living.

New York state in mid-December ordered restaurant owners to stop indoor dining again. The governor’s order came despite opposition from the beleaguered restaurant industry, which warned of holiday-season layoffs at a time when the federal government has yet to pass an additional CCP virus relief package.

Many people are leaving states like New York and California, citing pandemic restrictions. More than 126,000 people moved out of New York state between July 2019 and July 2020, according to preliminary Census Bureau data. That’s the biggest population drop of any state this year.

The Kentucky senator criticized governors locking down their economies because they have been receiving money from the federal government’s various stimulus packages, including the last CARES Act.

“The only thing that will get de Blasio and Cuomo to finally open up is when they run out of other people’s money,” Paul said.

“So I think that we shouldn’t be passing out any money to the states, we shouldn’t be rewarding their bad behavior,” he continued. “And really, this has probably been the worst time in the history of our country for power being accumulated into the hands of very few people.”

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has been criticized for placing too many restrictions on her constituents. Citing a surge in CCP virus infections in her state, Whitmer ordered on Nov. 15 that dine-in restaurants and bars, in-person learning at high schools and colleges, and many other businesses and activities close during the three weeks between Nov. 18 and Dec. 8.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said on Dec. 21 that the regional stay-at-home order imposed by the state for the entirety of Southern California will almost assuredly be extended beyond next week’s expiration date.

New government data shows that the pandemic has had a moderate-to-large negative impact on over three-quarters of the nation’s small businesses, with the hardest-hit being those in accommodation and food services.

In addition to the small-business impact of the restrictions, houses of worship have been impacted by governors’ trying to restrict the number of people who can gather at places of worship or if they can be open at all.

In California, parishes, as well as Protestant, Jewish, and other religious groups were barred from holding indoor gatherings of any kind.

Newsom’s recently issued “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” and “Regional Stay at Home Order” was found by the state’s Superior Court Judge as failing to satisfy the First Amendment’s guarantee of religious freedom of worship and practice because they aren’t applied equally and in the least restrictive manner required to achieve an essential public interest.

Paul said leaders should give good advice, not curb First Amendment rights.

“I lost two good friends this week to the virus. I’m not saying it’s not deadly,” Paul said.

“I’m not saying there’s not good advice. If you’re 85 years old and you ask me, should you go to church and sit there for two hours, I’d say my best advice is don’t. But I would never mandate that you can’t go to church. I would never mandate that you close the church. I would never mandate that you close religious school,” Paul said."	right

jmzcgo	republicans	Lil Pump attends Trump rally wearing 'MAGA' hat after declaring his support for the president	"Rapper Lil Pump doubled down on his support of Donald Trump by attending the president’s campaign rally in Florida on Sunday.

The “Gucci Gang” rapper became notoriously pro-Trump after he took a look at Joe Biden’s tax plan and reasoned that he would end up paying more to the federal government under a Biden presidency due to his wealth.

Lil Pump posted two videos to his Instagram Story on Sunday showing that he was in the front row of the president’s recent rally in the swing state. The video opens with an excited-looking Lil Pump sporting a red “Make America Great Again” hat as he listens intently to Trump speak.

He then turns the camera to show the president at the podium during his rally before turning the camera back to himself to emit a gleeful laugh before ending the video. There's no one except what appears to be Secret Service agents between the rapper and the stage, implying he was given a front-row seat to the event.

CHARLIE SHEEN REVEALS SURPRISING ROLE IN RAPPER LIL PUMP'S UPCOMING MUSIC VIDEO

The packed ""Make America Great Again Victory Rally"" took place in Miami-Dade County, which has been described as the coronavirus epicenter in the state. Some wore masks, while others disregarded the face coverings.

In his speech, Trump criticized Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, lockdowns, and insisted the pandemic was ""rounding"" the turn.

Lil Pump’s public support for Trump began last week when the “Be Like Me” artist took to Instagram to share a photoshopped image of himself shaking hands with the president. He captioned the picture, “THE DAY I MET TRUMP #trump202022020.”

RAPPER LIL PUMP SLAMMED FOR RACIST LYRICS, GESTURE IN TEASER VIDEO

The rapper followed up that post with a video shared on his Instagram Story in which he gave an expletive-filled explanation for his endorsement. He insulted the Democratic nominee noting that he takes issue with Biden’s plan to tax wealthy people, a category the artist believes he falls under.

The video, which was shared by multiple social media users despite being removed by Lil Pump, also sees the rapper lambasting “sleepy Joe” and praising his Republican opponent one week before the 2020 race comes to a close.

hrn4ev	republicans	WALSH: If We Are Tearing Down Memorials To Men Who Did Bad Things, What About George Floyd Memorials?	"Two familiar sights could be seen in different parts of the country over the last few weeks. In Buffalo, yet another statue of Christopher Columbus was removed at the behest of protesters. This joins the ranks of the dozens upon dozens of other statues and memorials of our historical heroes that have been taken down according to the demands of the mob, or simply torn down by the mob itself.

Meanwhile, over in Minnesota, yet another mural of George Floyd was unveiled. This one joins the growing number of other Floyd murals across the nation and around the world. And the murals are merely one way that our society has honored Floyd. Streets have been unofficially named after him and university buildings may soon follow. Nancy Pelosi gave Floyd’s family a folded American flag — a gesture more often reserved for the families of fallen war heroes — and Senate Democrats knelt silently for eight minutes in his honor. The place where Floyd died has even become something of a holy land where pilgrims go to be baptized and miraculously healed.

The point to emphasize here is that all of this is being done to celebrate the man George Floyd. This has gone way beyond merely speaking out against his death. We are now being told that we must honor George Floyd himself. And we are being told this at precisely the moment when we are also being told that we must stop honoring men like Columbus, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and other icons of history.

But if the sins of historical figures must be dredged up, and if those sins are reason enough to cast them onto the ash heap of history, then it seems only fair to look at George Floyd’s biography and see if he is actually worthy of all of these monuments and memorials. Thomas Jefferson and Christopher Columbus apparently do not pass the test, despite their world-changing and history-shaping achievements. What about Floyd?

If George Floyd ever achieved anything of note — much less anything that matches the accomplishments of the now-scorned historical figures mentioned above — we have not been told about it. What we do know is that, despite the media’s desperate attempts to dress him up in as favorable a light as possible, he was guilty of committing some truly horrific evils. His lengthy rap sheet includes relatively petty crimes like trespassing, and some not-as-petty crimes like theft and drug possession, but it also features an aggravated armed robbery against a woman. Here are the details of that crime, as provided by Snopes (hardly a right-wing outfit):

According to police officers’ probable-cause statement, which is often the basis of prosecutors’ case against suspects, the incident (on Aug. 9, 2007) unfolded like this: Two adults, Aracely Henriquez and Angel Negrete, and a toddler were in a home when they heard a knock at the front door. When Henriquez looked out the window, she saw a man “dressed in a blue uniform” who said “he was with the water department.” But when she opened the door, she realized the man was telling a lie and she tried shutting him out. Then, the statement reads: However, this male held the door open and prevented her from doing so. At this time, a black Ford Explorer pulled up in front of the Complainants’ residence and five other black males exited this vehicle and proceeded to the front door. The largest of these suspects forced his way into the residence, placed a pistol against the complainant’s abdomen, and forced her into the living room area of the residence. This large suspect then proceeded to search the residence while another armed suspect guarded the complainant, who was struck in the head and side areas by this second armed suspect with his pistol after she screamed for help. As the suspects looked through the residence, they demanded to know where the drugs and money were and Complainant Henriquez advised them that there were no such things in the residence. The suspects then took some jewelry along with the complainant’s cell phone before they fled the scene in the black Ford Explorer.

Floyd, who was buried in a golden casket at a funeral service attended by dignitaries from all over the country, is guilty of forcing his way into a woman’s house, holding a gun to her stomach in front of her child, and robbing her. This is no small transgression. It is an act of depraved wickedness, and one that has no doubt permanently traumatized the victim and her child. Imagine how that woman feels now when she walks by a mural with the face of her attacker. There is no getting around the fact that Floyd was a man who attacked and victimized the innocent. And those innocents are still alive, forced now to relive their trauma, and watch as the whole world heaps praise and adulation on the man who caused it.

It is insisted that Floyd reformed himself. Even if true, later-in-life reformation hasn’t been enough to vindicate other dead men who’ve been posthumously canceled by the mob. But there is reason to doubt the truth of the claim anyway. After all, Floyd was high on meth and fentanyl and trying to pass off counterfeit bills moments before his death. That does not appear to be the behavior of a man who has gotten himself onto the straight and narrow.

One could rightly argue that Floyd’s crimes will not have the impact of something like enabling slavery, which was a system of horrific and dehumanizing exploitation that some of our historical heroes either participated in or approved of. But why would the sins of the dead need to be historically significant in order to justify the destruction of their monuments and memorials? Is it not enough for the sin to be simply evil and depraved? And besides, most of the figures who’ve been targeted by the mob also performed many good deeds and achieved very great things. We build monuments to celebrate those aspects of their story. Floyd may not have done anything historically bad, but neither did he do anything historically good. He was a deeply flawed man who did at least one terribly evil thing and then died at the hands of the State after committing a crime. If that somehow exceeds the bar for memorialization, then Jefferson, Washington, Lincoln, etc., must make it over with lots of room to spare.

The majority of the votes were for President Donald Trump.

“Gabriel Sterling in the Secretary of State’s Office describes what happened in Fayette County: There were votes that had been scanned and were on a memory card, but the issue was that they hadn’t been uploaded,” 11Alive News reported. “He said it was more easily discoverable than the issue in Floyd County, because they were able to see that the number of people who were checked in on the early voting file in Fayette was higher than the number of people there was in the county’s reported vote total.”

Fayette County is a county that Trump won by 19 points in 2016 and is up by 6 points in this election, according to The New York Times.

Daily Beast reporter Sam Brodey wrote on Twitter: “GA elections spox @GabrielSterling says the ongoing election audit confirmed 2,755 previously uncounted votes in Fayette County 1,577 for Trump 1,128 for Biden Biden’s statewide advantage in GA now down to 12,929.”

1,128 for Biden Biden's statewide advantage in GA now down to 12,929 — Sam Brodey (@sambrodey) November 17, 2020

Yesterday, thousands of additional votes were found on a memory card that had not been uploaded in Floyd County, where Trump is leading by more than 40 points.

The Daily Wire reported:

The recovered votes may also help out GOP Sen. David Perdue, who is roughly 14,000 votes away from securing 50% of the vote in his bid for reelection and avoiding a runoff against Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff. “It’s very concerning,” Martin said. “But this doesn’t appear to be a widespread issue. I’m glad the audit revealed it, and it’s important that all votes are counted.” Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s office said the votes were missed because election workers failed to upload a memory card containing the votes into a ballot counting machine. The Floyd County discrepancy does not appear to be a widespread issue, the office of the secretary of state said.

“Sterling, who oversaw the implementation of the new statewide election system for the state, said that the unofficial breakdown of ballots was 1,643 for Trump, 865 for Biden and 16 for Libertarian Jo Jorgensen,” The Daily Wire reported separately. “The mistake happened because election officials reportedly missed uploading a memory card containing the votes to a ballot counting machine.”

Local reporter Jamie Dupree noted that he would be seeing a different reaction from people if the votes were found in Fulton County, which is a deep blue area.

“And we have a second county in Georgia where all the votes were not counted. Fayette County voted 53-46 for Trump,” Dupree said. “Just a thought again today….that if this was Fulton County finding uncounted votes, my Twitter mentions would be melting down. But when it’s two GOP counties (Floyd & Fayette), well it’s just a shrug of the shoulders.”

lzp4hw	republicans	Arizona and West Virginia announce today they're reopening at 100% capacity.	"Occupancy Limits Expire, Distancing And Mask Protocols Remain

PHOENIX -- Governor Doug Ducey today announced the next phase of COVID-19 mitigation. With cases dropping in Arizona, and vaccine distribution underway, it’s still important to keep our guard up, and these protocols reflect that approach.

The announcement follows 7 weeks of declining cases in Arizona, and the distribution of more than 2 million vaccines.

The following changes are reflected in a new Executive Order from Governor Ducey:

For businesses, physical distancing and mask protocols will remain in place, however specific occupancy percentage limitations will expire. This applies to restaurants, gyms, theaters, water parks, bowling alleys, and bars providing dine in services.

Spring Training and Major League Sports will have the ability to operate upon submission and approval of a plan to the Arizona Department of Health Services that demonstrates implementation of safety precautions and physical distancing.

Mayors and local entities will still be precluded from implementing extreme measures that shut down businesses.

“We’ve learned a lot over the past year,” said Governor Ducey. “Our businesses have done an excellent job at responding to this pandemic in a safe and responsible way. We will always admire the sacrifice they and their employees have made and their vigilance to protect against the virus.

“Unlike other states, we never did a shutdown here in Arizona. We withstood the calls from the extremes on both sides, and we will continue to ignore them. We always knew that fighting this virus would be dependent on the personal responsibility of everyday Arizonans.

“Like the rest of the country, Arizona has made its way out of the winter surge of cases. And we are leading the nation in the vaccination roll out. Our mitigation strategies have been targeted and data driven.

“Today’s announcement is a measured approach; we are not in the clear yet. We need to continue practicing personal responsibility. Wear a mask. Social distance. Stay home when you’re sick and wash your hands frequently.

“With the vaccine rollout advancing rapidly, we continue to have hope for the future.”

lzc3vn	republicans	Sen. Rand Paul Blocks Democrats from Funding Planned Parenthood Through Paycheck Protection Program	"Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) claimed a win Friday after forcing Democrats to remove from their COVID “liberal wish list” bill a provision that would have allowed every Planned Parenthood facility in the country to receive free taxpayer funds through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).

“Democrats knew this was never about COVID relief or helping small businesses,” said Dr. Paul, an ophthalmologist. “It was a shameless attempt to fund their radical agenda on the taxpayers’ backs and I was successful in preventing that from happening by stopping these funds from going to abortion mills.”

Dems knew this wasn’t about COVID relief/helping small businesses. Shameless attempt to fund their radical agenda & @PPFA on the taxpayers’ backs. I was successful in preventing that from happening by stopping these funds to abortion mills. Read more: https://t.co/K37N8cIYl5 — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) March 5, 2021

In a press statement, Paul’s office explained in the House version of the “massive $1.9 trillion liberal wish list,” individual Planned Parenthood facilities would have been treated as separate entities and, as such, eligible for the federal PPP aid.

Paul’s office explained further:

The original congressional intent of PPP was to limit large and well-financed groups, such as Planned Parenthood from receiving a loan, and instead provide relief to small business affected by COVID-19. Democrats had planned to waive affiliation rules for nonprofits to provide paycheck protection loans to Planned Parenthood in the House version of the COVID-19 relief package. The Paul team strenuously argued to the Senate Parliamentarian that this waiver would only benefit Planned Parenthood and thus violated the so-called Byrd rule. Before the Parliamentarian was able to rule on the arguments presented, the Democrats filed an updated version of the bill that did not include the offending provision – a concession that avoided setting a precedent.

Thank you, Senator @RandPaul , for preventing the money that was intended to serve as COVID relief for small businesses through the Payment Protection Program Program from going to Planned Parenthood. https://t.co/KW08s5rfrn — CWA LAC (@CWforA) March 6, 2021

Thank you @RandPaul for protecting the millions of Americans who oppose taxpayer-funded abortion, as well as protecting millions of Americans still in the womb from the violence of abortion. https://t.co/Xb7MTroQnV — March for Life (@March_for_Life) March 5, 2021

In May 2020, Planned Parenthood affiliates received $80 million in loans from the PPP in violation of the rules of the relief program. Subsequently, officials of the Small Business Administration and some members of Congress, including Sens. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Josh Hawley (R-MO), demanded the money be returned, threatening potential criminal prosecution.

Chairman Rubio called on AG Barr to & @TheJusticeDept to immediately review how Planned Parenthood Affiliates unlawfully received #PPP loans. Read here 👇https://t.co/HFWkIEyo8N — Senate Small Biz (@SmallBizCmte) July 7, 2020

The money needs to be recovered and if anybody knowingly falsified applications, they need to be prosecuted

https://t.co/FKnrkHnE2P #FoxNews — Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) May 20, 2020

Jacqueline Ayers, vice president of government relations & public policy at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, denied the provision in the current bill was related to “Planned Parenthood 501(c)(3) organizations,” according to Fox News.

“The local Planned Parenthood affiliates that previously obtained loans made available by the CARES Act were eligible under the affiliation rules defined by the Small Business Administration,” Ayers insisted, referring to Planned Parenthood abortion clinics as providers of “essential healthcare.”

“Now is the time for everyone to come together to address this pandemic and pass much-needed COVID-19 relief, not for uninformed political attacks on access to essential health care,” she said.

Similarly, in an op-ed at the Washington Times, Tom McClusky, president of March for Life Action, emphasized only nine percent of the COVID bill’s funding is actually slated to address the public health issues related to the coronavirus pandemic.

Nearly half of the funding in the measure will be held back from distribution until 2022, at the earliest, a time when the pandemic could largely have already subsided, he observed as well.

l1gyx4	republicans	AOC, Katie Couric, Other Left-Wing Leaders Say They Want to ‘Deprogram’ Conservatives, Trump ‘Cult’	"For decades, academics, elites, and many in the mainstream media have mocked conservatives for their traditional views and political beliefs.

However, after the events of January 6 at the U.S. Capitol, some are taking their anti-conservative views to a whole new level, calling for conservatives to be “deprogrammed or even “re-educated.”

Perhaps most ominous among the growing anti-conservative storm is the call by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) to have the government “deradicalize” Trump supporters, most of whom she deems to be white supremacists. According to AOC, “There are people who are radicalized right now. It’s going to take a very long time to deradicalize these people and a lot of effort.”

To accomplish her goal, AOC says we “need to double, triple or quadruple the funding for these programs.” She also calls for heavy-handed government censorship of media sources she accuses of peddling “misinformation.” AOC believes that Trump supporters and conservatives are being brainwashed by misinformation and disinformation, therefore, she says the U.S. government must stop the dissemination of this so-called “disinformation.”

Obviously, this flies in the face of the First Amendment, but since when has the far left ever cared about protecting free speech rights? Certainly not in the past two decades, that’s for sure.

AOC is far from the only prominent progressive who supports such un-American, unconstitutional actions.

Katie Couric, while appearing on HBO’s Real Time With Bill Maher, asked rhetorically, “How are we going to really almost deprogram these people who have signed up for the cult of Trump?”

Couric’s insult shows her contempt for those who disagree with her liberal political vision. It also shows that many on the left are not interested in listening to those with different political beliefs. They want to change their opponents’ beliefs to align with their liberal point of view.

Another example of this illiberal thinking by those on the left occurred when Eugene Robinson, a frequent liberal commentator on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, said, “There are millions of Americans, almost all white, almost all Republicans, who somehow need to be deprogrammed … It’s as if they are members of a cult, the Trumpist cult, and have to be deprogrammed.”

Robinson’s comments also highlight the racial element to all of this, which only further stokes the deep divisions in the country.

What AOC, Couric, Robinson, and the countless others who are calling for deprogramming of conservatives fail to realize is that silencing one’s political opponents is never the answer. It is how authoritarian regimes handle political dissent, not elected representatives in a free society.

hxyika	republicans	Republican party identification is up in Washington State, the highest in since 2012. The gap was narrowed by Republican identification gaining 8 points while Democrats lost 1 point.	"The Voter Outlook Index asks a representative sample of respondents throughout the state of Washington whether they expect things to get better or worse over the next few years for the country, the state, their community and their household. The results are combined into a single score with a range of +8 to –8. This month’s index score is 0.11, nearly a full point below the reading in December.

The trend in voter optimism has been downward since a peak in 2014 (1.94), the index having lost nearly two points (1.83) in the past six years. So we were not in a good mood even before COVID-19 arrived. Still, it’s somewhat surprising is that the index didn’t drop further, given the pandemic.

Voter outlook differed by region: It was highest in Eastern Washington (0.51), while it was the lowest it has ever been (–0.49) in the north Puget Sound counties (Snohomish to Whatcom), and the lowest it has been in King County since 1993 (–0.08).

Unsurprisingly, there were also differences by party identification. Generally speaking, while far from declaring morning in America, Republicans were more optimistic than Democrats. Republicans’ overall index score was +0.53 to the Democrats’ –0.9.

Looking at the “net scores” — the percentage who said “better” minus the percentage who said “worse” — Republicans scored were higher than Democrats’ for the country (+23% vs. –31%); for their community (+19% vs, +4%) and for their own households (+38% vs. +26%). Republicans were less optimistic about the state (–16%), although Democrats were evenly split (47% said “better”; 47% said “worse”).

Coinciding with this decline in overall voter optimism has been an increase — more like a rebalancing — of Republican Party identification over the past year. We don’t register by party in Washington so party identification is more like an attitude than a fixed characteristic. It provides an indicator of where a voter’s default political position is.

Since 1992, we have regularly asked voters how they would register if they did have to register by party. Democrats have registered as high as 46% and as low as 24%; Republicans have ranged from 41% to 18%.

A year ago, party identification was at 41% Democrats and 21% Republicans — the widest gap in the 28 years of this poll. Since then, the gap has narrowed in three subsequent polls to 11 points, which is just above the 10-year average of 10 points. The gap was narrowed by Republican identification gaining 8 points while Democrats lost 1 point. The 29% who identified as Republicans in this poll is the highest percentage since February 2012.

The question is, why has Republican identification increased and why are those who identify as Republicans generally more optimistic than the Democrats? Don’t they know a “Blue Tsunami” is supposed to be coming to wash them away? These data don’t suggest answers, but they pose a fascinating question. We’ll be watching."	right

hx245l	republicans	Michigan School Fires Popular Teacher For Saying 'Trump Is Our President'	"A Michigan school district fired a popular high school teacher and coach after he pointed out that ""Trump is our president"" on social media.

Varsity baseball coach and social studies teacher Justin Kucera said Walled Lake school district officials hauled him into a closed-door meeting after he indicated his support for President Trump's speech to reopen schools. He told the Washington Free Beacon the Walled Lake Western principal and district superintendent gave him an ultimatum: be fired or resign.

https://twitter.com/CoachKWLW/status/1280312826796675074?s=20

""I was required to meet with [human resources], the superintendent, and my principal [on July 10]. They initially took my statement on why I tweeted those tweets and they told me they would have a decision about my future employment in the upcoming days. When they completed the meeting, I was told I had the option to either be fired or resign."" Kucera said.

Neither the school district nor the principal responded to requests for comment.

Kucera said the statement that cost him his job was intended to unify, rather than divide.

""I know a lot of people are just rooting for Trump to fail, and I don't think that anybody should do that,"" Kucera said. ""Agree with him or not, you should want the president to do well. I apologized that [my tweet] brought so much negative attention, but I'm not sorry for what I said.""

Kucera was a popular figure at the high school before the episode, according to parents and former teachers. Even his detractors lauded him on social media as they condemned the tweet. One student said she would need to find a new ""favorite teacher"" after seeing the missive. Multiple sources said that the teacher never brought politics into the classroom.

Bryant Hixson, a recent Walled Lake Western graduate, said his political views have no impact on how he views his coach and teacher.

""Prior to Mr. Kucera's tweet, I cannot recall an instance where he shared his political affiliations while teaching or coaching,"" Hixson said. ""My political views have no impact on how I feel towards Mr. Kucera. Mr. Kucera has always been supportive of me as my AP World History and student leadership teacher and as my baseball and basketball coach.""

A parent of two Walled Lake Western boys told the Free Beacon—on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution—that Kucera was an apolitical figure who coached his son in baseball and basketball and taught his sons AP History and student leadership.

""Justin coached my son his entire high school career and also was his AP History teacher and student leadership teacher for two years. I know Justin very well,"" the parent said. ""If there's one thing that I would commend Justin for is, he always tried to stay apolitical. He always tried to stay right down the middle, avoid [political] conversations, and let the students make their own call based on their own life experiences."" The father of two believes Kucera lost his job because administrators caved to a mob that had little to do with the school district.

Other Walled Lake teachers have expressed their political views without any repercussions. Paulette Loe, a now-retired Walled Lake Western teacher, encouraged students to read an article from the Atlantic about ""how to beat Trump"" while still employed. Nicole Estes, a kindergarten teacher in the district, called Trump a ""sociopath"" and a ""narcissist"" on Facebook in 2016 and is still employed at Keith Elementary School. Neither Loe nor Estes responded to requests for comment.

The teachers' union representative that accompanied Kucera at the meeting did not respond to a request for comment."	right
hoymso	republicans	Tuesday: Chris Cuomo mocks Republicans for claiming that crime is rising in American cities claiming that they are just trying to scare people into voting for Trump. Wednesday: Chris Cuomo claims crime is rising and criticizes Trump for inaction.	"CNN anchor Chris Cuomo was called out for changing his tune about the rise in crime across the country, taking it seriously just one day after making light of the disturbing trend.

Major cities have seen a spike in homicides in recent weeks amid the Black Lives Matter movement and protests, and efforts to ""defund the police.""

On Tuesday, Cuomo appeared to be joking with colleague Don Lemon and seemed to suggest the rise in crime was merely fear-mongering.

""Democratic cities are in chaos right now, is this what you want from Joe Biden?"" Lemon said, mocking Republicans. ""And they're gonna take your country away and they're taking down the statues.""

""Crime is rising as they defund police,"" Cuomo chimed in.

""My gosh, it's so bad!"" Lemon continued, impersonating Republicans.

NEW YORK TIMES ACCUSED OF GOING SOFT ON CUOMO OVER NY NURSING HOME CONTROVERSY

As pointed out by the Reagan Battalion, however, the ""Cuomo Prime Time"" anchor wasn't nearly as passive on the issue the following night.

""The number of homicides are spiking,"" Cuomo told viewers Wednesday night. ""Look at the data: New York, Chicago, Louisville, Philadelphia, New Orleans, Denver, Miami. And the White House says it cares.""

He then played a clip of White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany stressing the rise of shootings in New York City to reporters.

Cuomo accused the Trump administration of only ""caring"" about the surge in violence so that it can ""blame it on their opponents.""

CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP

The CNN anchor went on to dismiss the White House's suggestion that the rise of crime is tied to the Black Lives Matter protests that have led city officials to ""turn on the cops,"" and instead pointed to the lifting of stay-at-home orders amid the response to the coronavirus outbreak and how crime saw a decrease earlier in the year when the shutdowns began.

Cuomo also acknowledged the ""reasons"" city violence had taken place before the pandemic, which he said were ""entrenched poverty"" and ""a culture of exclusion,"" though he did not mention that vast majority of major cities in the U.S. are run by Democratic politicians."	right

Trump's statement said donations to the GOP would be supporting ""Republicans in name only.""

Trump's Save America PAC has raised more than $31 million, OpenSecrets.com reported.

Visit the Business section of Insider for more stories.

Former President Donald Trump is trying to siphon donations away from the Republican National Committee and into his political action committee fund.

Trump, who recently flirted with starting his own political party, dubbed The Patriot Party, sent a letter warning donors to avoid supporting RINOs, or Republicans in name only.

""No more money for RINOS. They do nothing but hurt the Republican Party and our great voting base — they will never lead us to Greatness,"" his tweet-length statement said. ""Send your donation to Save America PAC at DonaldJTrump.com. We will bring it all back stronger than ever before!""

Fine print on the site clarifies that the Save America joint fundraising committee donates 90% of its funds to the Save America PAC, with 10% going to the MAGA PAC. Neither PAC is directly affiliated with the Republican Party.

Trump's Save America PAC has raised more than $31 million, OpenSecrets.com reported.

Trump's PAC website encourages visitors to ""become a founding member of the Save America team."" DonaldJTrump.com

Trump's relationship with GOP standard-bearers has been rocky since he left office in January.

In February, he called Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell a ""dour, sullen, unsmiling political hack"" after McConnell upbraided Trump for stoking the January 6 Capitol insurrection.

Trump told reporters last month that he would support Republican challengers to any GOP members of Congress who voted to impeach him, Bloomberg reported. ""Where necessary and appropriate, I will back primary rivals who espouse Making America Great Again and our policy of America First,"" he said.

This week he specifically attacked ""disloyal"" Sen. Lisa Murkowski, threatening to travel to Alaska to campaign against her.

This latest fundraising drive comes on the heels of Trump sending out cease-and-desist letters to top Republican campaign committees, warning them against using his image for fundraising without his approval. To appease Trump, the RNC opted to move part of its spring retreat to Mar-a-Lago, Insider's Grace Panetta reported.

Trump was expected to announce his bid for the 2024 presidential nomination during the Conservative Political Action Conference held in February but demurred. Instead, he once more baselessly claimed that he had won the 2020 election, teasing that 2024 might offer him a third election win.

""But who knows,"" he said, ""I may even decide to beat them for a third time."""	right

Sasse, who didn’t support Trump’s candidacy in 2016 or 2020, dismissed his critics in the state party as “angry about life” and out of step with regular Nebraskans.

“I listen to Nebraskans every day and very few of them are as angry about life as some of the people on this committee. Not all of you, but a lot,"" Sasse said in the video. ""Political addicts don’t represent most Nebraska conservatives.""

Sasse is one of several Republican officeholders under attack for criticizing Trump.

But Sasse is standing his ground. In the video released Thursday, he blamed Trump for inciting the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol that left a police officer and four others dead.

“Now, many of you are hacked off that I condemned his lies that led to a riot. Let’s be clear: the anger in the state party has never been about me violating principle or abandoning conservative policy. I’m one of the most conservative voters in the senate. The anger has always simply been about me not bending the knee to one guy,” Sasse said, looking directly at the camera to address state party officials.

Sasse called the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol “ugly,"" and said the “shameful mob violence to disrupt a constitutionally mandated meeting of the Congress to affirm … peaceful transfer of power” was a result of Trump spreading lies about the results of the 2020 election.

“It happened because the president lied to you. He lied about the election results for 60 days, despite losing 60 straight court challenges, many of them handed down by wonderful Trump-appointed judges,” Sasse said.

He said Trump also lied by saying then-Vice President Mike Pence Michael (Mike) Richard PenceDNC gathers opposition research on over 20 potential GOP presidential candidates Pence to give keynote address at National Conservative Student Conference The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Emergent BioSolutions - Can Cheney defy the odds and survive again? MORE could simply violate his constitutional oath by declaring him, instead of now-President Biden, the winner.

“That wasn’t true,” Sasse said.

“He then riled a mob that attacked the capitol, many chanting, ‘Hang Pence.’ If that president were a Democrat, we both know how you’d respond. But because he had 'Republican' behind his name, you’re defending him,” Sasse added, rebuking his critics.

Sasse said Republicans who have embraced Trump’s claims of a stolen election are straying from their core conservative beliefs and urged them to preserve the GOP’s identity as a party founded on long-standing principles instead of merely allegiance to the former president.

“Something has definitely changed over the last four years, but it’s not me,"" he said. ""Personality cults aren’t conservative. Conspiracy theories aren’t conservative. Lying that an election has been stolen, it’s not conservative. Acting like politics is a religion, it isn’t conservative.""

Sasse said most Nebraska voters agree with him and pointed to his 2020 reelection campaign, in which he won tens of thousands of more votes than Trump in the state in November.

He noted that he won the Omaha area “handily” while Trump lost it by “a lot.”

“Nebraskans aren’t rage addicts and that’s good news. You are welcome to censure me again, but let’s be clear about why this is happening — it’s because I still believe as you used to that politics isn’t about the weird worship of one dude,” he said.

The Nebraska Republican Party censured Sasse in May 2016 for not being supportive enough of Trump.

Sasse won his Senate Republican primary in May 2020 by a large margin, setting a record for votes received by a candidate for federal office in a Nebraska primary.

He carried all 93 counties in the state during the general election.

“We’re going to have to choose between conservatism and madness, between just trolling and actually persuading the rising generation of Americans again,” he said.

“That’s what I’m focused on and I sincerely hope many of you will join in celebrating these big worthwhile causes for freedom,” he added. “I’m always going to work hard for Nebraskans and I’m always going to tell you the truth.”"	right
l3z879	republicans	State Republicans push new voting restrictions after Trump’s loss	"POLITICO Dispatch: January 25 If you can’t win, change the rules of the game. That appears to be the rule state Republicans are following across the country in the aftermath of Trump’s loss, as they push for new voting restrictions.

The Republican state Senate caucus has endorsed ending no-excuse absentee voting in Georgia, which was disproportionately used by Democratic voters in the 2020 elections. (More than one-third of Biden’s votes in Georgia were cast by mail, versus just 18 percent of Trump’s votes.) Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who has rejected Trump’s fraud claims, also said he supported scrapping no-excuse mail voting because the system was too taxing on local election administrators.

However, the state’s GOP legislative leaders have yet to agree on exactly what to change. Republican Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, who is the president of the state Senate, told 11Alive News that he wouldn’t support ending no-excuse absentee voting, and state House Speaker David Ralston also sounded skeptical of ending the practice. Republicans are more universally aligned behind requiring absentee voters to submit a copy of an ID either when they request or return a ballot, which would replace the state’s signature verification system. Georgia already requires voters to show a photo ID when voting in person.

“I think that has the most likelihood of being signed into law,” said state Sen. Larry Walker, the vice chair of the Republican Senate caucus. Walker said he would be “very supportive” of that change and said his constituents were deeply concerned, saying he has gotten thousands of emails, letters and texts.

“A large percentage of my constituents have lost faith in the integrity of our election system,” he said. “So we're going to try to address some things that we feel like can restore the public's confidence in the system.”

He also rejected that claim that changes would disenfranchise voters, citing the state’s high turnout. “I don’t think any of these ideas are burdensome or overly restrictive or lead to what I would consider voter suppression,” he said.

According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan organization, 36 states have some form of voter ID law in place. The NCSL classifies Georgia as a “strict photo ID” state, meaning voters without approved ID must vote on a provisional ballot and take steps after the election to get their ballot counted.

But Georgia is unique among the closest 2020 battleground states in that Republicans control the governorship and both houses of the state legislature. That boxes out Democrats, who are broadly opposed to voter ID laws or other proposed electoral changes, like limiting absentee voting. Democratic governors in states with Republican legislatures, like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, could veto changes to election laws if there isn’t bipartisan agreement on what to alter.

“Looking at the disposition of the governments in them, I’m not sure that really a lot of them are going to be able to go the distance the way that Georgia will,” said Jason Snead, the executive director of the Honest Elections Project, a conservative group. “But I think that there is certainly a lot of interest in Pennsylvania, in Michigan, in Wisconsin.”

In Pennsylvania, Republicans lawmakers have signaled their intent to introduce voter ID laws and try to repeal the state’s bipartisan law allowing no-excuse mail voting, though Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf stands in their way. The issue could percolate through the 2022 midterm elections, when Republicans will try to retake the governorship.

“It isn’t a secret that further election law changes must be made,” Pennsylvania state Rep. Seth Grove, a Republican who chairs the House State Government Committee, said at a hearing on the state’s election laws on Thursday afternoon, noting that both Democrats and Republicans have proposed changes to Pennsylvania election laws. Thursday’s hearing was the first of a planned 14 total hearings on election laws.

In Arizona, another swing state that Biden narrowly carried, Republicans in the state Senate have advanced legislation that would result in more automatic recounts. Some Republicans also introduced legislation to abolish the state’s permanent early voting list — which a supermajority of voters are registered for — although a cosponsor of the legislation told the Arizona Republic, “It can’t pass and I don’t want to waste my time with it.”

And in North Carolina, the state's delayed voter ID policy could go into effect before the 2022 midterm election. In 2018, voters approved a constitutional amendment requiring voter ID, but it was blocked by a federal judge from taking effect for the 2020 cycle. A federal appeals judge overturned a order effectively blocking its implementation, but there is an ongoing legal battle in both state and federal courts over the law.

“Election integrity, election security, these issues aren’t going anywhere,” Snead said. “And I firmly believe that if a legislature in a particular state does not pass a reform this cycle, it does not mean it’ll never pass a reform, right?”"	right

“The last time the Senate convened, we had just reclaimed the Capitol from violent criminals who tried to stop Congress from doing our duty. The mob was fed lies. They were provoked by the president and other powerful people,” McConnell said on the Senate floor, marking the first convening of the full Senate since the attack.

McConnell’s statements carry significance ahead of an anticipated Senate impeachment trial. The GOP leader has told colleagues he hasn’t yet decided how he would vote on a House-passed article of impeachment against Trump.

His remark that the crowd was “fed lies” is a reference to baseless and debunked claims spread by Trump and members of his legal team and inner circle that widespread election fraud cost Trump a second term. Trump has not formally conceded the race to President-elect Joe Biden Joe BidenRepublican seeks to use Obama energy policies to criticize Biden WSJ editorial board: 'Purging Liz Cheney for honesty would diminish' GOP DNC gathers opposition research on over 20 potential GOP presidential candidates MORE.

Trump told supporters gathered at a rally near the White House on Jan. 6, shortly before the mob stormed the Capitol, that “they rigged it like they have never rigged an election” and declared “we won this election and we won it by a landslide.”

Several people died amid the riot on Jan. 6, including a Capitol Police officer who was injured while responding to the mob.

McConnell accused the rioters who breached the building of trying “to use fear and violence to stop a specific proceeding of the first branch of the federal government which they did not like.”

Protesters overwhelmed the Capitol’s security while lawmakers were tallying the vote of the Electoral College to make Biden the 46th president of the United States.

The melee temporarily halted the final certification of Biden’s victory, with both chambers later reconvening to resume the count once the Capitol campus had been secured.

“We stood together and said an angry mob would not get veto power over the rule of law in our nation, not even for one night,” McConnell said Tuesday.

Speaking against objections to the electoral votes of Arizona and Pennsylvania, McConnell argued on the Senate floor Jan. 6 that the 2020 presidential election wasn’t even that close in the end.

“This election actually was not unusually close. Just in recent history, 1976, 2000 and 2004 were all closer than this one,” he said.

More recently, McConnell has left colleagues guessing on how he might vote on the article of impeachment, which accuses Trump of inciting insurrection at the Capitol.

“While the press has been full of speculation, I have not made a final decision on how I will vote and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate,” he wrote in a note to colleagues last week."	right

jcd43x	republicans	Facebook and Twitter trying to help Biden become president by suppressing NY Post story	"The New York Post delivered bombshell reports Wednesday and Thursday revealing emails that appear to show Joe Biden’s son Hunter pursued — and in some cases, secured — lucrative deals with businesses in Ukraine and China by offering access to then-Vice President Biden, and potentially by offering other favors.

This could end up being the biggest story of this year’s presidential race.

Among other discoveries in the emails is an important message indicating that Hunter Biden set up a meeting between Joe Biden and a top executive at an energy company in Ukraine, Burisma Holdings.

BEN SHAPIRO SHREDS 'DUMBASS' TWITTER CEO JACK DORSEY OVER BLOCKED HUNTER BIDEN REPORT: 'IT'S A CLOWN SHOW'

The meeting allegedly occurred less than a year prior to Joe Biden using his position as vice president to pressure the Ukrainian government into dismissing its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who had been conducting an investigation into the very same energy company.

Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma — despite having no expertise in the energy industry — in 2014, not long after President Barack Obama put Joe Biden in charge of U.S. relations with Ukraine.

The emails obtained by The New York Post also show a top executive at Burisma asking Hunter Biden for “advice on how you could use your influence” to help the company, as well as separate messages showing Hunter Biden actively pursuing deals involving a top energy firm in China that would be “interesting for me and my family.”

If accurate, The New York Post’s reports could have a monumental impact on the presidential election now underway.

It appears that, at the very least, Joe Biden lied to the American people — he repeatedly insisted he had nothing to do with Hunter’s business dealings — and it seems Joe Biden was engaged in highly unethical behavior, using his office to enrich his son.

At worst, Joe Biden may have broken federal law.

But as important as this incredible story is, there is a much bigger story looming in the background: the way social media giants Facebook and Twitter responded to The New York Post reporting.

Following the Post article’s publication, Facebook and Twitter deliberately limited the news story’s distribution and blocked key figures from discussing it over their social media platforms.

“While I will intentionally not link to the New York Post, I want be clear that this story is eligible to be fact checked by Facebook’s third-party fact checking partners,” wrote Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone in a tweet posted Wednesday. “In the meantime, we are reducing its distribution on our platform.”

Following its decision to block the spread of The New York Post article on Twitter, a spokesperson for the company said: “In line with our Hacked Materials Policy, as well as our approach to blocking URLs, we are taking action to block any links to or images of the material in question on Twitter.”

Censorship by Facebook and Twitter of The New York Post’s report on Hunter and Joe Biden is an outrageous example of social media companies’ proclivity to silence conservative content and bury negative stories about the left. This is perhaps the most important attempt ever made by a social media company to alter the outcome of an American election.

If Facebook and Twitter had applied similar protocols to stories meant to hurt President Trump, they would have never allowed users to share the countless articles published by mainstream outlets about unverified accounts of the Trump campaign allegedly colluding with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election. They also would have blocked the recent New York Times report about President Trump’s tax records.

Yet social media giants allowed those articles to be shared widely. Why? Because social media companies are now working tirelessly to protect Democrats and destroy the Republican Party. They are partisan institutions masquerading as “open platforms” and operate daily as extensions of America’s left.

The blatant censorship displayed by Facebook and Twitter regarding The New York Post story should send a chill down the spine of every American. What these companies are doing in this crucial period when voting has already begun in the Nov. 3 election is reprehensible and dangerous for the preservation of our constitutional republic.

Facebook and Twitter are two of the largest distributors of news in the world. Twelve percent of all U.S. adults say they access news sites on Twitter. And 43 percent of adults say they get news from Facebook.

If Facebook, Twitter and other tech giants are permitted to ban the sharing of news stories published by reputable outlets, they can ban virtually any form of political speech. This is dangerous because free speech is the foundation upon which all free societies exist.

Many on the left, and even some on the right, argue that because Facebook and Twitter are private companies they should be allowed to ban anything they want on their platforms.

As libertarians, we are sympathetic to that argument. We believe that in an open marketplace, companies should have the freedom to set their own rules, and consumers should “vote” for the services they like with their dollars, time and product use.

But social media companies do not operate in a truly free market. They benefit from special legal protections granted to them by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which allows them to escape legal liability for erroneous information posted by third parties on their site.

In a perfectly free-market system, platforms would be held liable when users publish illicit content on their website. The only reason that isn’t the case is because the federal government has created special rules that permit Facebook and Twitter to operate in their current forms.

These companies have made billions of dollars because of these unique legal protections. And how have they repaid the American people? By refusing to operate in good faith and silencing speech that’s inconvenient for their political allies.

Now the tech titans are wielding more power than ever. With a single keystroke, they have the power to conceal information that the public has a right to know.

It’s long past time for Congress to repeal Section 230 and replace it with a new federal law that would grant special liability protections to only those social media companies that sincerely work toward providing open platforms that protect — not punish or silence — all forms of political speech, as well as many other forms of speech.

Reasonable restrictions on pornography, extreme violence and other content not suited for mass distribution should be allowed, of course. But social media companies should never be permitted to ban Americans’ political speech — whether that speech come from liberals, conservatives, libertarians or socialists — while also earning a fortune from legal carve-outs granted to them by the same people who are being unjustly silenced.

A failure to act now would only embolden the social media giants to continue expanding their speech bans and further limit the ability for people of all political, social and religious persuasions from engaging in open dialogue. This must not be tolerated.

gjpoj4	republicans	CNN: Why is Trump giving medical advice, he’s not a doctor. Also CNN: Puts Greta Thunberg on “expert” Coronavirus council	"Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg is among the so-called experts joining CNN’s Anderson Cooper for a CNN Town Hall on coronavirus.

The panel is called “Coronavirus – Facts and Fears” and will feature former acting Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Richard Besser, former Obama Health and Human Service Secretary Kathleen Seblius, climate activist Thunberg, and CNN’s medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta.

Former acting CDC director Richard Besser, former HHS secretary Kathleen Sebelius and activist Greta Thunberg join @AndersonCooper & @DrSanjayGupta for a live #CNNTownHall. Coronavirus – Facts and Fears, Thursday at 8 p.m. ET pic.twitter.com/I4FrXgwaL6 — CNN (@CNN) May 13, 2020

Thunberg has been a champion of socialist overhauls such as the Green New Deal and earned her place in the national spotlight for her apocalyptic rhetoric on climate change. It’s unclear how a 17-year-old high school drop out is somehow an infectious disease expert qualified for CNN’s “expert” panel.

Thus far, Thunberg’s only contribution to the coronavirus pandemic was her generous donation of $100,000 to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). After winning a $100,000 prize for her global activism, Thunberg donated the money to children in need. Yes, it’s generous, but it doesn’t qualify her to speak on a panel of experts about coronavirus.

CNN will likely relate Thunberg’s climate message to the decrease in air pollution seen worldwide thanks to the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent global quarantine.

Climate scientists noted a decrease in nitrogen dioxide over China, an increase in air quality worldwide, better water quality in Italy, and a significant reduction in coal usage. These alleged accomplishments are the results climate activists have been calling for.

This climate “success” comes with a painful price as U.S. unemployment surges to 14.7 percent, the worse unemployment numbers since the Great Depression. Over 20 million people lost their job in the U.S. just April, and the public health problems such as mental health, suicide, and the delay of non-essential procedures caused by extended government lockdowns are yet to be measured.

Tonight, CNN will host Thunberg and her intolerant scolding to likely explain why an utterly devastated economy is good for the climate and Thunberg’s socialist climate guidelines.

Like Thunberg, Gupta has also taken a problem with the Trump administration and climate change in the past. In August 2019, Gupta released a CNN special titled “A Toxic Report: Trump’s Environmental Impact.” Gupta also took aim at President Trump’s health in the past claiming he has a common form of heart disease after Trump’s doctor said he is healthy and fit for office.

Tonight’s “Facts and Fears” town hall is sure to be a fear-mongering approach to coronavirus derived from few facts."	right

Democrats and some Republicans have blamed them for contributing to the misinformation that ultimately incited rioters to storm the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday in a bid to stop Congress from counting the electoral votes. Five people are confirmed dead in the Capitol breach.

The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association also said it would be suspending contributions to lawmakers who ""voted to undermine our democracy.""

These announcements are the latest in a growing number of condemnations against the objecting lawmakers. Fellow lawmakers have called for them to be impeached or to resign. One of Hawley's major donors, Missouri businessman David Humphreys, who contributed millions to Hawley's first campaign, disavowed the senator on Thursday, calling him a ""political opportunist.""

On Wednesday, soon after the Capitol was breached by violent pro-Trump rioters, the CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers, Jay Timmons, implored Vice President Pence to ""seriously consider"" invoking the 25th Amendment.

“Armed violent protestors who support the baseless claim by outgoing president Trump that he somehow won an election that he overwhelmingly lost have stormed the U.S. Capitol today, attacking police officers and first responders, because Trump refused to accept defeat in a free and fair election,” said Timmons on Wednesday."	right

kqfpzu	republicans	Worse Than Treason: No amount of rationalizing can change the fact that the majority of the Republican Party is advocating for the overthrow of an American election.	"Today, the “sedition caucus” includes at least 140 members of the House—that is, some two-thirds of the House GOP membership—and at least 10 members of the Senate. Their challenge comes after weeks of insistence that the 2020 election was rigged, plagued by fraud, and even subverted by foreign powers. The president and his minions have filed, and lost, scores of lawsuits that ranged from minor disputes over process to childlike, error-filled briefs full of bizarre assertions.

Instead of threatening to gavel these objections into irrelevance, as Biden did four years ago, Vice President Mike Pence “welcomes” these challenges. Pence’s career is finished, but he could have stood for the Constitution he claims to love and which he swore to defend. However, cowardice is contagious, and no mask was thick enough to protect Pence from the pathogen of fear.

Perhaps the sedition caucus didn’t mean to go this far. Its members began by arguing that we all just needed to humor President Trump, to give him time to process the loss, and to treat the president of the United States as a toddler who was going home empty-handed. He wouldn’t be a dead-ender, they assured us, because that would be too humiliating. The Republican Party would never immolate itself for a proven loser.

But for Trump, there is no such thing as too much humiliation. The only shame in Trump world lies in admitting defeat. And so Trump doubled down, as anyone who had watched him for more than 10 minutes knew he would. And then he tripled, quadrupled, quintupled down. And just as they have done for the past four years, elected Republicans tried to convince themselves that if they supported this outrage, it would be the last time they would be required to surrender their dignity; that this betrayal of the Constitution would be the last treachery demanded of them. That if they complied one more time, they would be allowed to go back to their privileged lives far from the districts they claim to represent—places few of them really want to live after tasting life in the Emerald City.

It is possible that the sedition caucus knew that all these challenges would fail. It is possible that they know their last insult to American democracy, on Wednesday, will go nowhere, as well. This is irrelevant: Engaging in sedition for insincere reasons does not make it less hideous. Arguing that you betrayed the Constitution only as theater is no defense.

Indeed, shredding the Constitution purely for personal gain is perhaps the worst of the sins of the sedition caucus. It would almost be a relief to know that these Republicans really believe what they’re trying to sell, that they are genuine fanatics and ideologues who have at least paid us the respect of pitting their sincere beliefs against our own.

But we are, in the main, dealing with people who are far worse than true believers. The Republican Party is infested with craven opportunists, the kind of people who will try to tell us later that they were “just asking questions,” that they were “defending the process,” and of course, that they were merely representing “the will of the people.” Senators Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz are not idiots. These are men who understand perfectly well what they are doing. Senator Mitt Romney sees it clearly, noting that his GOP colleagues are engaged in “an egregious ploy” to “enhance political ambition.”"	right
