ft9mu3g	gyazus	republican	That kick 0:30 should be a non bailable offence.	right
ft9vks0	gyazus	republican	That kick in the head was the most pathetic thing ive ever seen, fuck that guy	right
ft9tin8	gyazus	republican	I dare anyone to defend this behavior. This is outrageous.	right
ft9w8y4	gyazus	republican	Just wondering how these bailouts would work if the rioters decided to riot in Hollywood, Beverly Hills and Malibu? These disconnected “stars” have no idea the actual devastation that they are helping fuel. Sad	right
fta7asm	gyazus	republican	"What do you get when a human being sustains a kick to the head with the force seen here and sleaze bag, has-been C-list losers dripping in hypocrisy immediately turn to social media to make sure the world knows just how very woke they are by offering to donate to the suspect? 

You get four more with Trump."	right

ft9ojq4	gyazus	republican	Democrats in their true form.	right
ft9nfy7	gyazus	republican	How peaceful	right
ft9ozp5	gyazus	republican	I agree. That dude got starched on the run and then kicked in the head while out cold. Pure bullshit. Personally I don’t think anyone should get bailed out. If they can make the decision to go and destroy someone else’s property, business, or hurt someone as a form of “protest” then they should be held accountable just like anyone else would be in the normal world.	right
ftamq2n	gyazus	republican	You should see the full video of that dude on the ground in a weird position with his head closest to the camera. He literally got stoned. I don’t know if he died or not but there was blood everywhere and it was like six people just pummeling him with rocks and kicks. I don’t find many things disturbing but that video was hard to watch.	right
ftb04g3	gyazus	republican	"he's been caught if didn't already know

ftazxvb	gyazus	republican	"Not in Cuomo and DeBlasio's New York. I've always wanted to be a complete tourist and visit New York City, but that has changed.

Instead, Republicans should look into visiting San Diego. I know, I know, it's in ultra-liberal heaven of southern California, but most people don't realize San Diego has a republican mayor. Mayor Kevin Faulconer. I believe San Diego is the most populated city with a republican mayor.

It should be to nobody's surprise that San Diego is consistently voted one of the most beautiful cities in the US. Is it a coincidence that the most beautiful city in the US is helmed by a republican? Probably not.

Plus, you hear very little negative issues in the national media concerning San Diego. Also, not coincidental."	right
fta1zdp	gyazus	republican	Both of them were found and arrested. They have made bail but they still have to go to court. There is no escaping that video.	right
ft9ywus	gyazus	republican	[deleted]	right
ftacqrp	gyazus	republican	I lived in Malibu for over a decade. Let me tell you how it would go: the celebs who live there have private security or access to private security firms if they’re not already using them. I have dealt with some of these firms. These are not mall cops; they are ex-military and ex-law enforcement, armed to the teeth. So their houses would be protected by the same ex-cops they demonize while they were hiding under their beds. For those of us in Malibu who are not rich or celebs, they would leave us unprotected to die.	right
ftbgmc8	gyazus	republican	Some people aren't capable or willing to acknowledge that.	right

ft9znsy	gyazus	republican	They aren’t protesting, they are “enjoying” the no cop situation	right
fta7l1m	gyazus	republican	Cowards. Little needle dick boys. You put that suspect in Pelican Bay for a day in any pod with the big boys. Oh it ain't pretty.	right
ft9su2o	gyazus	republican	I know right How can people be so cruel.	right
ftaehox	gyazus	republican	That kick should draw an attempted murder charge - it won't but it should.	right
ftbd2ju	gyazus	republican	Of course they made bail. George Soros is a billionaire.	right
fta1os3	gyazus	republican	So... if one guy does one thing you’re justifying someone else hurting someone else?	right

Didn't have to look very far to find someone defending the riots."	right
ftafhlc	gyazus	republican	That’s sad bro, but I imagine very true	right
ft9vrzj	gyazus	republican	And where does the money from bail go? Doesn’t it just feed the system that they are protesting?	right
ft9u0re	gyazus	republican	Unfortunately Hollywood has just become a liberal cult at this point.  I honestly don’t think half of them believe their own bullshit.  But if they speak out against they are blacklisted like James Woods.  Like  Drew Brees.  I respected him for standing up what he believes in.  But after getting bullied and threatened he backtracked and now has “joined” them.  Nobody is ever gonna bully me to stop believing what I believe in!	right
ft9rhd6	gyazus	republican	"Why are they bailing out all these white supremecists?

Edit: they are saying the agitators causing the most problems are white supremacists while simultaneoisly bailing people out of jail."	right
ft9yv10	gyazus	republican	[deleted]	right
fta2ii7	gyazus	republican	Exactly. Look what we can all get away with now.	right
ft9tosu	gyazus	republican	I haven’t been kicking unconscious people in the head though, so I must be part of the problem too. I can’t wait for this to blow up in their faces.	right
fta1vf0	gyazus	republican	The veneer of civilization is very thin. People who have never known real hardship are rioting and assaulting people they do not know for crimes they did not commit. Yet they feel justified. Leftism has become religion. Do not be surprised when one of them blows up a plane or commits an outright terrorist act.	right
ftabg5d	gyazus	republican	I think the point of the video was not to say bail should be suspended. It’s that these Hollywood celebs were providing a specific fund for bailing out violent rioters. Example: A guy could be arrested for mugging someone. I believe he’s entitled to a bail hearing but I’m not going to donate to a fund for him. In this instance it’s particularly disturbing because we can see videos of what they’re doing. We would see how fast this fund would dry up if there was a video of someone soccer kicking Seth Rogan in the head in the streets of West Hollywood. He has no brains to damage anyway, but my point remains.	right
ftbg6vk	gyazus	republican	"I hope you're not going to school to be a lawyer.

There IS NO Constitutional right to bail.

Ever hear the phrase, ""held without bail""?

There is a Constitutional protection against EXCESSIVE bail, but not TO bail.

It's sad that sooooo many people have a drastic and false misunderstanding of what rights are real and protected by the Constitution, and what ""rights"" are fabricated and a figment of the imagination."	right
ftbukr3	gyazus	republican	How can you be the aggressor when you are protecting property from rioters?	right
ftbt30q	gyazus	republican	"> Dude on the ground was the aggressor actually, he had a machete trying to protect his favourite bar,

Pick one."	right
ftafwss	gyazus	republican	Unfortunately I'm pretty sure the dude that did it was underage so there isn't alot that will probably happen to him...	right
ftabon1	gyazus	republican	Wow,Really? I didn’t know that. /s	right
ftam1xx	gyazus	republican	I’ll also add that some of the same celebrities who virtue signal on social media about every popular left wing cause under the sun secretly have the kinds of weapons in their homes that would make militia members in the woods of Kentucky jealous. I have seen some of the firepower floating around that enclave. Same people who call 2A advocates “nuts.” It’s all an illusion and a perfect example of “laws for thee but not for me.” There’s also a misperception that everyone in Malibu is either a celeb or rich. Not true. There’s even a trailer park in Malibu. Mind you it’s an expensive and really nice trailer park, but still. All the non-celebs would have to stick together because I promise you the Hollywood hypocrites would not allocate their private security to the greater Malibu community.	right
ftajm8s	gyazus	republican	Yeah, it goes into the public treasury that pays for police among other things as well	right
ftaf0w0	gyazus	republican	But neither really should be?	right
ftac158	gyazus	republican	"Yea I was being Captain Obvious.
But when I started using reddit I never expected r/politics to be so fucking biased."	right
ftaypk0	gyazus	republican	In principle you are correct. The only problem with your statement is that you do not see this behavior from the right. Not at this level of violence or involvement of so many. The further you go to the left or right you find dictatorship and a loss of freedom. The spectrum of politics is not a flat line. If you follow the far left and the far right long enough they just end up meeting along that circle. Like Thanos said there is a balance, for safety and maximum freedom. We just can't seem to find it. For our children and grandchildren I hope we do.	right

gfsmaxg	kcm159	republican	No, everyone else in the family wanted to sell the house, but she grew up there and did not want to move. So he was not downplaying it since the rest of the family wanted the house to be sold so that they can make a huge profit from selling it to Trump.	right

g47sx7m	in94xp	republican	No one is a true holder of all of the democratic party’s ideas and values. Its also important to never give hate the time of day.

g47xeyb	in94xp	republican	Yeah this is very important. I found out my sister’s a dem, tried to talk to her about it. Ended up shaking up her whole belief system by asking her to prove her ideas of racism with facts. She was very upset that she had been duped and had zero substantive evidence for her beliefs. I felt very bad about halfway though talking to her for not being more kind about it... I guess I thought she would’ve had one logical leg to stand on in the discussion but she literally had all her political ideas come to her through Facebook, emotion and lies. She couldn’t admit she was wrong but had to stop talking cause her ego was utterly destroyed. She asked what to do and I literally had to tell her she needs learn how the government works... I definitely will be much more relaxed and open to talking to a dem next time.. they literally have no idea what is going in the world and the convo will start and end with their emotions. We just gotta love em and accept their mistakes in the understanding of politics as something that any human could do.	right

There's also the issue around the Bengal famine and this quote and several others like it. Which is pretty racist. 


In 1937, he told the Palestine Royal Commission: ""I do not admit for instance, that a great wrong has been done to the Red Indians of America or the black people of Australia. I do not admit that a wrong has been done to these people by the fact that a stronger race, a higher-grade race, a more worldly wise race to put it that way, has come in and taken their place."""	right

fzoyng3	i0b5vv	republican	The statue is recognizing him as a World War 2 hero. He was not perfect, but nor were any of historical figures. If that statue was put up to to celebrate something bad he did then you have a good case for tearing it down. But that statue went up because he rallied the British nation to fight when all seemed lost. That's why there are statues of him, because we are honoring his resolve.	right
fzq41gm	i0b5vv	republican	He wasn’t a perfect man but he was the hero we had and a crucial part in saving western democracy.	right
fzp7hnc	i0b5vv	republican	English? They’ll soon be speaking Arabic. But at least it’s not German! Churchill must be absolutely spinning in his grave. All that effort just to have the commies and nazis walk in through the front door and take over the place without a shot fired.	right

gqpibab	m3j2wq	republican	Tbh all the democrats I’ve seen call black people “white supremacists” over not agreeing with them over an opinion that won’t matter 30 years from now is hilarious.	right
gqpl3nf	m3j2wq	republican	Im 16 and Republican and I come from a historically democratic state. If I were to ever say that I was Republican to majority of my classmates they'll assume Im a racist. The thing is that line of reasoning is completely illogical, because the rupublican party was birthed out of anti-slavery sentiment . While on the other hand the Democrats used racist views and slavery to gain political leverage. After the civil war , Confederates sided with the Democrats not the Republicans. DONT FORGET WHERE WE CAME FROM!!	right
gqpdcgo	m3j2wq	republican	This is reddit, like 90% of the user base is unemployed students trying to get useless degrees. I’m really not surprised, you’ll find this left wing rhetoric basically everywhere.	right

After the election she said that - even though Democrats have the house and senate democracey still hasnt been saved. She implied taht the existence of other view points than her own is the cause of a failing democracy which is absolutely ludicrous. the entire point of democracy is to come to an agreement based off the views of different groups!	right
gqpp8hc	m3j2wq	republican	Yeah, and let’s not forget that the Democratic Party literally wanted to keep slavery, while the republicans (who were formed to oppose the Kansas-Nebraska Act) wanted to stop slavery. But we’re the racist ones. Makes no sense.	right

gqp226s	m3j2wq	republican	Not at all, anyone can be racist which we clearly see today. But we both know what that moderator was hinting at, he was definitely implying that republicans are essentially white Racists, or at least that’s how I perceived it.	right
gqp8yn0	m3j2wq	republican	"Okay this is also another extreme. There are definitely racist republicans out there. The main point of all this is to say that both republicans and democrats can be bad or good and either hold or go against your beliefs.

An example of this is Tulsi Gabbard. She might be a democrat but she is so logical that I agree with her on a few topics."	right

gqq05v0	m3j2wq	republican	The issue is the media makes us look terrible every chance they get.

It's not an accident. It's a calculated and extremely effective tactic. How many people out there are willing to express conservative opinions if they will be branded racists in return? Not only you can lose your job for it, but you will most certainly not hired elsewhere. Which company will risk hiring a racist?

So, this seems stupid, but it's an extremely effective way to shut down opposing opinion."	right
gqpom3k	m3j2wq	republican	Ah I smell a smug, soylent drinking liberal that probably knows next to nothing about the south and buys into the tired “muh ignorant, racist hick” trope despite the southern states being far more racially diverse than most liberal parts of the country. I’m sure it’s not your fault as you’re most likely 14 and your two moms haven’t taken you around the country yet, but I’d suggest keeping an open mind.	right

fzo1v58	i04v99	republican	I know a lot of lefties blame CNN for shutting Sanders out of primary coverage.	right
fznzs49	i04v99	republican	"I think there is logic to their motive, though it is stupid. It is your standard witch hunt logic but applied to white supremacy rather than witchcraft. The logic is that, to them, CNN is defending white supremacy. Despite CNN defending BLM, it is owned by white elites and is thus part of the oppression that black people face. They know that no one will peaceably give up their wealth (at least not all of it), so destroying the wealth, taking the wealth, or coercing the wealthy to give up their wealth is what is necessary to achieve their goals.

This is obviously foolish and stupid, but if you assume their insane beliefs, attacking CNN makes sense. Their beliefs are unfalsifiable so they justify every destructive act they do. What I mean is that for reason to work, a theory needs to be falsifiable. If you claim ""all swans are white"", it is impossible to find all swans to show they are white. So you make a bit of an assumption, based on all the swans we have seen, they are all white. But if we found a black swan, it would falsify the statement. A good theory has to be falsifiable given a certain finding. So we go with the idea that swans are white until we find that which  makes it false. If there is nothing that can prove your statement false, then there is nothing that really makes it true. ""The earth is round"" could be proven false if we found evidence that it is flat, we haven't, there is no evidence of that, but if there were, it would falsify that claim. That means the claim is testable.

Anyway, there is no way to falsify BLM's claims because they constantly shift. There is no way to falsify their claim that ""white people have all the power"" because they just take it to another step. If CNN helps BLM, well they can still attack CNN because it was founded by a white man and has made money from advertisers, many of which were founded by white men. And if the white man that owns CNN (Ted Turner) was supportive of BLM and all the companies that advertise on CNN supported BLM, well they can still all be torn down because some of the money they were founded on was attained through white privilege. And if somehow Ted Turner, all the advertisers on CNN, all the reporters and other workers of CNN somehow all attained their positions in life without white privilege, then their forefathers did. If any of them are black, well they aren't black enough. 

It is unfalsifiable because it keeps going back, there is always something that makes you guilty. It's your standard witch hunt."	right

g4vixph	iqtxd2	republican	Yes this is the path we must take. These politicians are making decisions that are forcing small businesses to close down permanently, and they are fine with that. If they force others to follow strict rules so should they. They need to be accountable for the actions they enforce. Why do they get a free pass and I dont?	right

g4jorot	ipefqy	republican	He didn't know how to spell Melania	right
g4jraaf	ipefqy	republican	The fact anyone would let a President drive them this far has problems. I've dealt with Obama for 8 years, I didn't even post one bad thing about him on the internet. I dealt with it and adapted. I will do the same if Biden wins, I may not like it, but I'm not going to go off the deep end like these people, again, I'll adapt and survive, regardless of who is president.

I agreed with him that Obama had policies I did not like, but I did not hate him even though I voted against him.  We ended up having a meaningful conversation about how the simple presidential election process weeds out any truly ""bad"" people and it is ok to hate the policies of a person and not immediately go to ""Hitler.""

You know a bunch of morons are going to lose their shit, screaming “racist cops” at the tops of their lungs watching this video.

Period.	right

This is a two on one situation that absolutely shoulder have been handled before that guy was able to grab his gun. Any person with any training would have been able to handle this guy. I wrestled for 11 years and I've held people down that were much larger than me for a long time without expending a ton of energy myself. You can see these to completely relied on there gear and then got in to trouble. They always need to be prepared and expect the worse but they're need to be trained to handle it	right

g2q5tb6	ifsgr4	republican	When people start talking about sending social workers to domestic calls, [I always think of this police call.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssARbfxqTh0) Domestic calls are some of the most dangerous calls that police respond to.

g2qrio9	ifsgr4	republican	Instead of straw manning and acting all superior, why don’t you try suggesting real logical policy change?

g2r35ox	ifsgr4	republican	Being bias and kids in a car has nothing to do with anything. The video clearly shows him ignoring police and bending over and reaching into his car. Our cops want to go home to their family's. Watch the video op posted, it shows things go south fast. It's his fault he was shot, the evidence in the video proves it. I will die on this hill	right
g2r80md	ifsgr4	republican	Right there with you. All Jacob Blake had to was stop walking. He chose not to and became a threat. In that situation, as a cop, you can’t know if there is a gun in the car, you have to assume the worst. If a cop can’t treat somebody who isn’t complying, especially after being tased, as a threat then what is the point? Any criminal can do whatever the hell they want with no fear of repercussions. Either that or cops need full military style body armor and even more fire power than they already have. It’s a good thing Mr. Blake didn’t die, not for his sake but so that BLM can’t use him as a martyr. I hope to God these cops don’t get charged with attempted murder or something stupid.	right
g2qwvqu	ifsgr4	republican	"You really shouldn't forget that.

If the cops have you at gunpoint and are trying to take you into custody and say ""keep your hands where I can see them"" and then you twist around and reach into your vehicle, you are going to get shot.

I'm glad you had the opportunity to learn something valuable today."	right
g2qtrpt	ifsgr4	republican	Honestly, you think he would have been shot if he didn’t resist arrest and try to reach into his vehicle while ignoring orders from the police?	right
g2qwycp	ifsgr4	republican	Thanks for not knowing what murder is.	right

g2wywcn	igpnbm	republican	Yeah FOX is biased but at least they don’t try and hide it like CNN does	right
g2vp6yg	igpnbm	republican	Peaceful protests do not require curfews.	right
g2vpeav	igpnbm	republican	Riots and protests have different definitions, but CNN refuses to call anything a riot or violent. When private property is destroyed, museums, libraries, and businesses burnt down, people are assaulted, stores looted, shots are fired, explosions go off, cops are injured etc. that is no longer a protest. Even when there is an official statement of a riot, hacks like CNN still refer to them as protests, at that point it is clearly gaslighting people.	right
g2vov6r	igpnbm	republican	Normally I would agree with you, because that is supposed to be how news networks run.  Unfortunately this is CNN, the same network who pitched a fit when DT got an extra scoop of ice cream.  Also, in the case of Kenosha, violent protests is the proper phrasing.  Police officers dont get bricks thrown at them at a peaceful protest.	right
g2vr786	igpnbm	republican	What if someone beat the shit out of you over a disagreement? Would you call that assault or just an argument?	right
g2vzgss	igpnbm	republican	"Different cultures.

g2x5igr	igpnbm	republican	"The officers were wrestling with the guy and tazed him and then he just brushes it off and marches towards his car. Resisting arrest while you have a warrant out on you? He's had past charges of sexual assault too so where's your #metoo or #believeallwomen? 

If you were a cop who tried to subdue a guy and he resist arest and doesn't get effected by a tazer, he goes and reaches into a car. What do you do? Do you wait for him to commit grand theft auto with hostages in the back? Do you let him grab the possible weapon and shoot you or your partner, or do you shoot the suspect until he's subdued? All this is going on in the officers heads with adrenaline pumping. 

Oh and the guy has a past of resisting arrest and drawing weapons on police, also again the charges of sexual assault. and the women called the police. 

But yeah those cops were racist, next time someone assualts you please don't call the cops"	right
g2wf67p	igpnbm	republican	I’ve seen nothing about that little boy in the news. The only reason I know about what happened is through social media.	right
g2w9hol	igpnbm	republican	You are actually part of the bigger problem yourself, by dismissing a child being killed in a racial hate crime as 'seemingly no motive' - do you work for CNN?	right
g2wg5xg	igpnbm	republican	Seemingly no motive .. funny how that gets applied. Was there a seeming motive for floyd was it just because the cop was white?	right
g2w59cq	igpnbm	republican	He wasn't killed	right
g2wgmln	igpnbm	republican	"> man went to prison

Wrong, this case just happened a couple weeks ago. He’s in jail. Trial hasn’t occurred, no verdict, no sentencing. 

> he is now in prison and denied bail

Wrong again. Those in prison have already been convicted, therefore they wouldn’t have a chance at bail. Sessoms is in jail and held without bond — why? Because there was already a statewide manhunt for him, which gives credibility that he’s a flight risk. 

> Justice was served

Once again, wrong. The case hasn’t gone to trial yet. 

> i don’t understand why so many right wingers are upset that this kid isn’t getting national attention

Of course you wouldn’t understand! After all you’re the party of late-term abortions, supporting BLM who are against the nuclear family, and supporting Obama who put kids in cages and did countless drone strikes overseas killing hundreds of kids. 

Stay awake in civics class next time."	right

g2w2q06	igpnbm	republican	"Cultural differences can adjust for most of those. 

That’s fine, but police violence isn’t an issue, inner city violence is a much bigger issue."	right
g2w40z4	igpnbm	republican	"Okay, but this shooting is a good shoot. Floyd died of a heart attack. Brooks was a good shoot. Taylor was because she was involved with a drug dealer and was tied to a murder by her ex who she was with less than a month before (cops didn’t know they split when the warrant was served they got shot at and returned fire, even though the officers announced themselves after the 3rd knock. 

The fact is that bad shoots are extremely rare and almost always clear cut because the person was posing a real danger. 

Your society has a mono culture with different values and because of that, your police have less danger to face. Finland has less crime than the US so it tends to not have to face the issues in the US. It also has a lot less temperate weather that keeps people indoors longer in the year. 

Chicago crime drops dramatically in the winter too

Plus, we wouldn't want them doing it to us, and they have. Then in modmail they say ""You fucking fascists, of course you'd ban me!!"" Yeah, they came to troll. So of course other subs will ban people for the same thing. Why test it at all anyway? There's no point and it's trashy behavior. We need to be better and set the example."	right

g9nts0p	jg0z9r	republican	That’s wild, Grandpa. I don’t like the president’s crazy tweets as much as the next guy.

g99u17u	jdjge9	republican	To be fair, not commenting on the polls, but the support for Biden isn't because they like Biden, it's because they hate Trump. They're not going to turn up at his rallies. The best we can hope for is that they also don't turn up at the polls	right

gavmuu0	jmej2l	republican	We have faith despite what the polls say because we truly support our president and are not voting to settle, like what most are doing on the other side of the pond. When it comes to wanting your candidate to win, wanting your voices heard, and wanting your favored policies following through, you go in to win, not to anticipate defeat. I hope this answers your question!	right

gavffen	jmej2l	republican	People die of diseases everyday. Especially so in poorer countries. Combining that with the fact with the fact that the symptoms of coronavirus are extremely similar to many other illnesses makes is pretty easy to believe that a country could easily hide COVID deaths by simply claiming that a given person died of a different illness.	right

g78h0hc	j2opln	republican	"[Watch the video for yourself and decide.] (https://twitter.com/i/status/1309990341076893696)  
(Might be the first post. Might be the third. You'll find it, I'm sure)  

You can see the first driver of the car get out before the person charged gets in, then immediately drives into the crowd. She didn't indicate that she was about to move, or slowly pull forward, honk her horn, whatever. 

She wasn't being attacked before getting in the car. The previous driver didn't feel threatened enough to not get out of the car. Who was the first driver? Why was she just left there? What happened just before this video to cause the guy in the front to feel the need to video the car? 

Also note that most news reports about this only show the video from the point that she's already surrounded, having just driven into the crowd, leaving out these potentially critical details. 

There's definitely some questions remaining about what happened. I'd be interested to see if anyone had videos that start earlier and give more context.

g77fmzo	j2opln	republican	They weren’t they were in a Parking Lot, she intentionally drove into the Lot to Drive over them. I’m sure during the trial more information will come out about her, will they actually show it in MSM that is the bigger question. During trial I’m sure Lawyers will discover that she is Part of a BLM, or Antifa group. It’s unfortunate that people can’t have civil discussions about politics without running each other over with cars and destroying property.	right
g77flvb	j2opln	republican	"Yeah, I still haven't heard if they were blocking the road or not. Does anyone have info on this? None of the articles I've read have said one way or the other.

I don't care which side is blocking the road or driving. Stay out of the streets. If a crowd tries to block me and my family in, I'm going through them or over them. We've all seen what mobs are capable of. I have no interest in me or my family being subjected to mob violence."	right

I don't even get what the angle would be -- is the accusation that she's stealing ballots on the USB? Anything that could be stolen digitally would get found during the paper ballot recount.	right

Can’t be 100% sure that’s how our neighbors in Georgia do things).

My question is, wouldn’t Georgia’s hand recount of ballots have rooted out and rectified anything like a”planted” usb drive of false vote totals?  Anyone caught blatantly undermining our election process should be criminally prosecuted, but i don’t think it will change the election results.

Full disclosure, I’m not a Republican. Was just scrolling by and the video/comments caught my attention because it’s the first I’ve seen like it."	right

- Giving a person with dementia the presidential nominee is messed up. Joe Biden belongs in a home with a bedside nurse. 

-If the Democrats wanted to win the moderates of the country, then they should’ve went with Tulsi Gabbard. 

-inciting the riots are of civil unrest due to “racism” is ridiculous. There are a number of factors like “social programs” screwing up minorities especially the Black community 

- All Lives Matter. BLM is destroying the black family nucleus! They even state this on their website 

-Pandering to Leftist extremists, hailing Marxist ideology in public institutions, policing what I want to say, do and act, being inside a damn echo chamber of orange man bad, Women’s Psychology is anti-men, being a MAN is sexist, Cancel culture is encouraging mob culture, My professors are pushing this liberal agenda instead of being OBJECTIVE with facts. THIS ALL EXISTS IN MY COLLEGE!! 

-The last straw came, when these so called liberals say they would rather live in a third world country than in a dictatorship in the US is utterly laughable. When I disagreed, I was ridiculed even when I told them I am from a third word country 

-Finally, I read Trump’s plan. I fucking loved it. Man someone give this guy the damn Nobel Peace Prize already. Getting out of the liberal mind is truly liberating (oh the irony) 

Everyone in my family is voting Republican locally, and we’re giving Trump our votes."	right
g5ffv4p	itkdl9	republican	I appreciate it, glad I’m finally home	right
g5ffice	itkdl9	republican	These are just my personal opinions. It’s fine if you have difference of opinions but we should discuss this in a public discourse instead of ripping each other’s head off	right
g5fjop1	itkdl9	republican	My breaking point was when these liberals stated they would rather live in a third world country than the US. When I spoke out in opposition and spoke my side (I am from a third world country), I was ridiculed and shouted at. I was looking for a civil discourse, not a shouting match.	right

g5fglbt	itkdl9	republican	I voted Blue since 96 and even voted for Obama the 1st term. Two years in to his 1st term the anti America and anti police shit started and all the race talk. Everything was race. I was heartbroken and stunned. I did not even vote his 2 term. I could no longer do it. I had family and friends cus me and basically disown me, but my conscience is clear.  You have a hard road ahead of you bud, but I am proud of you. It’s hard to make a switch when there is so much to lose. Trump 2020.	right

I cant wait for this to be ""fact checked"" like every other blatant evidence of voter fraud and irregularity thats come out. How anyone, and i mean literally anyone can look at all the affidavits and now even camera footage and try say ""this is fine"" is being incredibly tribalist and disingenuous. Disgusting, like genuinely this is the kind of corruption you see in third world countrys, the elections should not be this unsafe. This must never happen again, universal mail in voting should never happen again, paper ballots only with ID on election day and miliatary ballots only. The old way is quite clearly the safest way but still you have people likr this involved with the counting. My blood boils."	right

geumer0	k7sbrp	republican	"i feel like there’s more to this than these people just being brainwashed that orange man bad. it’s hard to justify using deliberate deception for political purpose when you accusing your domestic enemy of the same thing.

i’m trying to say, it’s my theory that these people committing these acts seem as if they’re trying to save cheek. they look scared. either they’re promised money/power for ‘getting the job done’ or they’re granted the promise of keeping their history of fraud and corruption under wraps. if they’re being blackmailed by higher ups they’ll do anything to get it done. 

this helter-skelter approach of widespread election fraud makes it very easy to get sloppy and trip up and overlook things as long as you get the desired result. 

well here we have it people, hundreds of sworn testimonies, video proof, and statistical data blowing the door open. and the more it opens the more the roaches scatter. the sloppier they get, the less validity they’ll hold in the eyes of our citizens. 

and this is just regarding the vote counters, but this theory can be be applied to the postal workers, people in these three letter organizations, pedowood, government representatives, the governors themselves, previous presidents, silicon valley, the list goes on.

And because the EU is such an authoritarian entity, the EU has been extremely hostile to the UK in to make a point to anyone else that might have aspirations to leave. It's an authoritarian institution, fundamentally.

They have enough pull that when they fight to keep their consumer based holidays, they get their way.

However i think these endless lockdowns are ridiculous, the statistics show the survival rate to be roughly 99% if you are under 70, and recently yes we have been seeing a lot more infections but thats due to a lot of false positives in the tests it would seem.

At the end of the day the virus will cause significantly less damage and death to the country overall than the destruction of the economy and deaths from suicide/ other diseases. As for the WEF talking about the great reset, its not even a ""conspiracy"" they are openly talking about it. Im all for the individuals liberty first, if you want to stay at home because you are afraid then more power to you, a lot of people just want to go to work and get on with their lives. I've seen countless people who are 70+ and are ""vulnerable"" who share the same thought process. The governments all over the world need to stop this insanity, the people i see screeching about masks/lockdowns the most are politicians who then actively break the rules themselves when its convenient and nobody is looking.

It wont be long until people protest hard against this or just ignore it, looking at australias authoritarian lockdowns probably gets most the powerful people in thr world extremely excited. Especially the WEF."	right

gd8d3gf	jyrx6w	republican	We should be encouraging people to engage in responsible behavior based on everyone's individual situation, whatever that means to them. Keeps the government at bay, and lets things continue mostly. More importantly, it doesn't foster the same animosity and cabin fever that lockdowns do. Sure, have the CDC and WHO release their studies and information, and maybe even try to get people en mass to read it and inform themselves, but most importantly, let them make up their own mind on what to do with that information. Let businesses go through the same process. If they value taking precautions, then they can take precautions.	right
gd817f2	jyrx6w	republican	Yeah, they sure do look out for the little people /s	right
gd879o5	jyrx6w	republican	I’m all honesty, survival rate is one of numerous statistics that need to be looked at when analyzing covid-19. While it is an important characteristic, it is also important to understand that surviving the virus is a single, but primary, challenge that the world faces. The people who contract the virus and end up being hospitalized are another concern that needs to be taken more seriously. Those who are hospitalized or quarantined end up taking away from our economic well-being as they rely on a system of welfare in many cases. That being said, the virus is dangerous for our economic well-being as a whole even if the person survives since it inhibits them from working for weeks, and in many cases, makes them reliant on the government for welfare. The virus isn’t a joke or a hoax; it needs to be taken seriously as it is destroying our economy in certain sectors and increasing the peoples’ reliance on government facilities.	right

Also what's on his face at the end? Spit? Whys he not wiping that off his face atleast.

Edit: watched it on Instagram for the sound, it is spit. Very strange he doesn't atleast wipe it off his face

Also the blue hair girl laughs he's getting ""his ass beat by girls"" despite him clearly not wanting to fight back at all.

Grey sweat pants girl is very ghetto if it weren't already clear. She calls the boy ""her bitch"" and eggs him on to hit her and he says he was raised right and won't hit her back"	right

ggrmckw	kijfec	republican	If he vetos then it takes two thirds of congress to override and make it law without the presidents signature. It passed by more than two thirds already	right
ggrqntm	kijfec	republican	Yeah, I feel it would provide time to actually read the bill and let the public know what is really happening. So even if congress overturns veto the public will be able to weigh in and communicate with their elected officials.	right

You’re hired to do marketing and the boss doesn’t like .... your marketing. Likewise, and as a point of comparison, advertising agencies lose accounts every day for lame campaigns or ad campaigns that don’t boost sales. Marketing executives lose their jobs for taking companies down roads that are bound to lose money or are not in line with company ethos or the image the company wants. No doubt their firings were multilayered but I wouldn’t say they were fired for holding an opinion. These aren’t administrative assistants, they chart the course for the company in the biggest market in the western world.	right

Open to a different opinion here. I want people to have guns to protect themselves or even just for fun, but you still need to be responsible."	right
gbe2oi6	jp7l9o	republican	Lmao wdym “all for Biden”. There are some mail in ballots for trump too but the majority are for Biden because dems were more likely to vote with mail in ballots.

There’s no doubt that black lives matter, just like white and Hispanic ones do too. While you’re bringing up numbers, isn’t it weird that the BLM movement has killed more black lives than in all of 2020? What about Chicago having the highest number of black on black murder in a weekend in 50 years this past month? Did their lives matter? If BLM was really about black lives mattering, then they’d focus on reducing black on black crime, which btw, kills more 25x+ more blacks per year than white police on black violence. Oh how about black on black crime increasing in NY after they decided to defund the police? BLM is a Marxist organization that cares nothing for black lives.	right

""No Democrat will honestly ask whether Bernie Sanders incited the shooter that nearly killed Steve Scalise.""

""No Democrat will ask whether Maxine Waters incited violence when she literally told her supporters"" to confront Trump officials in public.

More will be coming out regarding January 6th, however the timeline of events that day are enough to demonstrate the amount of incompetence that should bar the former president from holding public office ever again at the bare minimum.

\*denotes my commentary

8:17 a.m: President Trump tweets allegations of vote fraud, stating, ""States want to correct their votes, which they now know were based on irregularities and fraud, plus corrupt process never received legislative approval. All Mike Pence has to do is send them back to the States, AND WE WIN. Do it Mike, this is a time for extreme courage!""

12:00 p.m: President Trump begins his speech. Repeating allegations, criticizing Pence and the Legislative branch. \*Disregarding the judgment of the judicial branch and encouraging supporters to fight for their country. To stop the certified, adjudicated, constitutionally mandated process.

12:53 p.m: Rioters overwhelm police along the outer perimeter west of the Capitol building.

1:00 p.m: Pence releases a letter stating that the Constitution prevents him from unilaterally interfering with the 2021 United States electoral count.

1:03 p.m: Rioters have overrun three layers of barricades and have forced police officers to the base of the west Capitol steps.

1:09 p.m: Chief Sund asks to declare an emergency and call for deployment of the National Guard.

1:10 p.m: President Trump ends his speech. Encouraging the crowd to march to the Capitol: ""We’re going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.""

1:26 p.m: The U.S. Capitol Police order evacuation of at least two buildings in the Capitol complex

1:30 p.m: Capitol Police are overwhelmed and forced to retreat up the steps of the Capitol.

1:49 p.m: Capitol Police Chief Sund requests immediate assistance from District of Columbia National Guard.

1:50 p.m: D.C. Metro Police on-scene commander Robert Glover declares a riot.

1:59 p.m: Chief Sund receives the first reports that rioters had reached the Capitol's doors and windows and were trying to break in.

2:10 p.m: The mob west of the Capitol chase police up the steps, breaching the final barricade and approach an entrance directly below the Senate chamber.

2:12 p.m: The first rioter enters the Capitol through a broken window, then opening a door for others.

2:13 p.m: Vice President Pence is moved from the Senate chamber to a nearby office. The Senate is called into recess.

2:14 p.m: Rioters chase a lone Capitol Police officer up northwest stairs, where there are doors to the Senate chamber in both directions, as police inside the chamber attempt to lock doors. If the mob had arrived about a minute earlier, it would have been in sight of Vice President Pence as he was moved into an office about 100 feet from the landing.

2:20 p.m: The House adjourns and starts to evacuate.

2:24 p.m: President Trump tweets, ""Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth!""\*34 minutes after a riot was declared, 12 minutes after reports stating rioters were inside the building.

2:38 p.m: President Trump tweets,""Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!"". \*There is no such thing as staying peaceful at this point, rioters are in active conflict with security forces. Rioters have broken through and been inside for  26 minutes.

3:13 p.m: President Trump tweets, ""I am asking for everyone at the U.S. Capitol to remain peaceful. No violence! Remember, WE are the Party of Law & Order – respect the Law and our great men and women in Blue. Thank you!"". \*Finally, an ok call for no violence. 1 hour and 23 minutes after a riot has been declared. 1 hour after rioters had already made it inside the building.....

\*Then nothing for an hour, as the situation unfolds.

4:17 p.m: Trump tweets a video “I know your pain. I know you’re hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election and everyone knows it, especially the other side. But you have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order. We have to respect our great people in law and order. We don’t want anybody hurt. It’s a very tough period of time. There’s never been a time like this where such a thing happened. Where they could take it away from all of us: From me, from you, from our country. This was a fraudulent election, but we can’t play into the hands of these people. We have to have peace. So, go home. We love you. You are very special. You’ve seen what happens. You see the way others are treated that are so bad, so evil. I know how you feel. But go home and go home in peace.”

6:01 p.m: President Trump tweets,""These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!""""...Remember this day forever...""

8:00 p.m: U.S. Capitol Police declare the Capitol building to be secure.

Anyone that still, to this day, supports one man's attempt to overthrow democracy which CULMINATED, not BEGAN, visibly on January 6th and seeks to enforce their will upon the non-silent majority that refuses to acquiesce. These individuals give credit to a man that has contested results and refused to concede before even a single vote was cast  in 2016, and recently attempted to lead one branch of our government in usurping the other two.

I do not denounce rational unity, as in the opinions and ideas of others that seek to better society in their judgment. I denounce those who use this freedom to do harm to others by silencing their voice and granting them injustice.

Former president Trump incited a physical attack that threatened the lives of citizens who defended the constitution, and then he continued to incite while lives were in danger. This is why, at a minimum, Donald Trump should never again be allowed to hold office.

Remember this day forever, to quote the man himself. Because it was the day that a domestic threat to the constitution very clearly presented itself."	right
gkwsxfo	l5lpbz	republican	How bout Stacey Abrams?	right
gkvz8td	l5lpbz	republican	"Representatives in the House and Senators cannot be impeached, just expelled.  It requires a 2/3 vote to expel a member.

The present-day Democrats will not vote to expel one of their own.  The last time the GOP had a 2/3 majority in the Senate was 1875.  The last time they had a 2/3 majority in the House was 1923."	right
gkvmucb	l5lpbz	republican	"He isn't.  He spends a lot of his time pissing people off.

He is also one of the most principled people in the Senate, if not the most."	right
gkw2gee	l5lpbz	republican	"All those bumper stickers from the Dems .. ""Resist"".  It is okay as long as they are resisting us.  The moment it is the other way around is when we are inciting violence."	right
gkw5r0y	l5lpbz	republican	We can sit back and say this until we are blue in the face, because they don’t give a single shit.  They get off on it.	right
