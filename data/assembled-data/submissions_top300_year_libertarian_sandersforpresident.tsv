i63jdh	libertarian	I was falsely arrested in 2013 by a dangerous and corrupt detective. I survived it, but I lost 60,000 dollars in legal fees, spent 6 days in jail, and faced the possibility of life in prison. Help me Arrest Fairfax County Detective Darrin DeCoster and reinvestigate all of his past cases	"On October 3rd, 2013, Detective DeCoster had me arrested for charges of rape and abduction with intent to defile. The accuser, Jenny Zhang, claimed that she was raped sometime between March 1st - June 1st of 2012, and claimed that I was a stalker who was infatuated with her.

Detective DeCoster actually had evidence that Jenny Zhang was lying about her accusations. He had access to her records (she has a history of going to the police for making accusations), he was aware of her serious borderline personality disorder, there were huge discrepancies between Jenny and her friend's statements (her friend supposedly “witnessed” the event), and there were over 40,000 social media messages between Jenny and me that could generally prove where I was every single day.

Regardless, DeCoster went to the magistrate and lied about having a confession (I never confessed to anything) and he told the magistrate that Jenny and her friends statements matched (which is entirely false). By lying to the magistrate, DeCoster was able to procure two felony warrants for my arrest.

The charges were dropped at the preliminary hearing when Jenny and DeCoster were confronted with all of this evidence again. DeCoster made no comment while Jenny tried to change the year of when she was raped. She actually went back and forth of whether it happened in 2012 or 2013. Neither of her timelines could work because most of the time, I was not physically even in my house where the supposed allegations took place.

The damage was already done. I lost 60,000 dollars in legal fees, lost a semester of school, I was arrested in front of my peers, and I faced the possibility of life in prison for a crime I did not commit. DeCoster has a history of abusing his powers and has also arrested innocent people in the past. In Fairfax County, according to many lawyers I have talked to who wish to remain anonymous, DeCoster has a reputation for lying, for being abusive, and for needlessly arresting people. DeCoster has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that his reckless and dangerous behavior has resulted in a lot of strife for many innocent people. There is also no telling how many innocent people he may have helped to convict who are sitting in jail as a result of DeCoster's depraved investigative tactics.

This video included in this petition has all the details on my case, including footage from my interrogation, a recording of my telephone sting, conflicting and awkward statements from Jenny's friend, and much more.

This other video has footage from a case DeCoster handled in 2011 where he coerced a false confession out of an innocent man named Russell. Russell was eventually exonerated but he spent 18 months in jail for a crime he did not commit. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH-hJ-K5Cg&t=1s

Jenny Zhang has a history of making accusations. She has accused a classmate of ours, David Nguyen, of sexual assault and kidnapping in 2011. That case ended in a conviction. Jenny and her father also called the police on me in 2014 after seeing me at a local gym. I was not even aware the police were called and this happened after witnesses shared what they saw. According to them, Jenny and her family could not explain why they called the police. Nothing happened as a result.

Both Detective DeCoster and Jenny Zhang have not faced consequences for their actions. They both have a history of malicious and patterned tendencies to hurt people that have never been addressed. I need your help to hold these two accountable for their criminal behaviors. Detective DeCoster has proven that he has no qualms with arresting people without evidence and will lie to magistrates to procure arrest warrants. Jenny Zhang has a serious personality disorder that has never been truly dealt with and has shown that she is happy to go to the police whenever she wants to achieve her desire of revenge.

I need this sense of justice and closure. Most importantly, I need to have this peace of mind that these two individuals are not harming anyone else. My obligation is to share my story in order to have a chance of discontinuing the belligerent actions of these two individuals.

*NOTE* Please do not donate. The funds do not go to me or any fundraiser. I am doing this in order to highlight the issue and bring attention to the fact that the Fairfax County Police has continued to support and protect two dangerous individuals that need to be held accountable for their criminal behavior.***"	right

kucm6n	libertarian	"'Turning Point USA' leader deletes tweet saying he sent ""80+ buses full of patriots to D.C. to fight for the president"". Turning Point's website openly advertised the campaign, offering free bus rides and complimentary hotel rooms to anyone willing to travel to D.C."	"Charlie Kirk, the founder of the conservative student group Turning Point USA (TPUSA), deleted a tweet in which he claimed to be sending more than 80 buses filled with President Donald Trump’s supporters to Washington, D.C.

Featured Video Hide

The deleted tweet, uncovered by the Daily Dot on Saturday, was posted just two days before Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.

“The historic event will likely be one of the largest and most consequential in American history,” Kirk wrote. “The team at @TrumpStudents & Turning Point Action are honored to help make this happen, sending 80+ buses full of patriots to DC to fight for this president.”

In the wake of the Capitol riot, Charlie Kirk has deleted a tweet in which he discussed sending ""80+ buses full of patriots to DC to fight for this president."" https://t.co/2NRwdt257v pic.twitter.com/VqdRNWqMMZ — Mikael Thalen (@MikaelThalen) January 9, 2021

The tweet garnered attention online after the riot on Wednesday, which led to the death of four Trump supporters as well as one police officer, who was reportedly violently bludgeoned with a fire extinguisher.

Before the riot, Trump supporters attended a rally near the White House where the president called on the crowd to march to the Capitol as Congress was counting the Electoral College votes.

Kirk, as well as numerous other high-profile figures in Trump’s orbit, spent weeks prior to Wednesday spreading debunked claims of widespread voter fraud.

The conservative even played into conspiracy theories regarding the “Pence Card,” the false belief that Vice President Mike Pence could overturn the election, in statements on Monday.

“Despite what the media and certain weak intellectually-compromised Constitutional scholars are telling you, Mike Pence does not have to accept the results of polluted and poisoned electors. He does not,” Kirk said.

Countless Trump supporters, convinced that Pence had committed treason thanks to the rhetoric online, were heard openly calling for the vice president to be hanged during the riot.

The website for Turning Point Action (TPA), an offshoot organization of TPUSA, earlier in the week openly advertised the campaign, offering both bus rides and complimentary hotel rooms to those willing to come to D.C.

It remains unclear how many buses were ultimately used in the shuttle and whether any occupants joined in on the siege.

Speaking with the Daily Dot, Brian Caviness, a 23-year-old TPUSA member from Texas who took one such bus to hear the president speak, stated that the organization only intended to stay for the rally and not the ensuing march.

Caviness, who condemned the violence on his Facebook page, stated that he left on the bus just as the Capitol was being overtaken.

“All I can say is, I was just in the middle of a very dangerous situation I do not support…” he said.

In a statement to the Daily Dot, a TPA spokesperson likewise condemned the violence and asserted that its organization was in no way involved with the events at the Capitol.

“Turning Point Action (TPA) did bus some students to the January 6th rally, which included a speech from the President of the United States. Following the president’s remarks, and in keeping with itinerary, TPA bused those students immediately out of the area,” the spokesperson said. “No TPA buses were involved, nor did TPA encourage participation in the march to the Capitol. TPA’s leadership condemns political violence and immediately did so as soon as news broke of the incident at the Capitol Building.”

Trump supporters, some of whom are still calling for violence, are already planning to return to the Capitol to disrupt the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden on Jan. 20.

At current, TPA does not appear to be backing or offering rides to the Inauguration Day protest.

Kirk has since tried to distance himself from the uprising at the Capitol by condemning those who participated on Twitter.

gmc706	libertarian	Rand Paul says no-knock warrants 'should be forbidden' in wake of Breonna Taylor shooting	"Rand Paul says no-knock warrants 'should be forbidden' in wake of Breonna Taylor shooting

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — U.S. Sen. Rand Paul is speaking out about the controversial shooting of former Louisville EMT Breonna Taylor, who was killed by police during a ""no-knock"" search warrant that experts have heavily criticized.

In an exclusive statement to The Courier Journal, the Republican lawmaker expressed concern about the Louisville Metro Police Department's search of Taylor's apartment on March 13, which has led to a national outcry.

Court records show police obtained a no-knock warrant before using a battering ram to enter Taylor's apartment at around 1 a.m. as part of a narcotics investigation.

But the warrant shows Taylor was not the main subject of the investigation, and that no narcotics were found in her apartment after she was shot eight times by police.

""No one should lose their life in pursuit of a crime without a victim, and 'no-knock' warrants should be forbidden,"" Paul said. ""Let’s hope the investigation provides justice.""

Paul's comments come as local leaders are changing police policies around no-knock warrants in the wake of Taylor's fatal shooting.

Mayor Greg Fischer, a Democrat, announced Monday that all no-knock warrants will now require approval from the chief of police or a designee before being submitted to a judge. He said doing so will provide another ""level of scrutiny.""

The U.S. Supreme Court has said judges may allow police to search without knocking when they have a reasonable suspicion that under the “particular circumstances” of the case, the targets could destroy evidence.

Also: What we know about Breonna Taylor's boyfriend and the charges against him

Legal experts, however, have criticized the vague language in the Taylor warrant given her apartment did not have cameras.

“I don’t know how this ever cleared a supervisor’s desk,” Lexington attorney Mark Wohlander, a former FBI agent and federal prosecutor, told The Courier Journal this weekend.

Brian Gallini, a law professor at University of Arkansas who has written about the Fourth Amendment, said if a no-knock warrant was appropriate in raiding Taylor's apartment, ""then every routine drug transaction would justify grounds for no-knock.""

Paul, a libertarian-leaning lawmaker, is one of the fiercest defenders of Fourth Amendment rights in Congress. He expressed previous concern that local law enforcement is becoming too militarized.

""There is a systemic problem with today’s law enforcement,"" Paul said in a 2014 op-ed for TIME Magazine.

The senator was addressing protests and riots in the wake of the Ferguson, Missouri, police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown. At the time Paul said ""big government"" was at the heart of the problem.

""Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies — where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement,"" Paul said in the 2014 editorial.

Paul joins elected officials from Kentucky and around the country who've spoken out about Taylor's shooting.

U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, a California Democrat, demanded last week that federal investigators examine the controversial shooting.

""Her family deserves answers,"" she said.

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, said the shooting, ""should be thoroughly and promptly investigated.""

Rep. John Yarmuth, who represents Louisville in Washington, described Taylor, who was an ER technician, as a ""brave and selfless public servant."" He said the shooting was another example of a ""nation sick and tired of seeing and hearing of black and brown lives being taken so wantonly and so coldly.""

gwmxny	libertarian	NRA Accidentally Forgets To Rise Up Against Tyrannical Government	"An embarrassed National Rifle Association says it totally forgot to do the one thing it has been saying for years it is solely there to do.

“Our whole reason for lobbying for looser gun laws and amassing huge personal arsenals of weapons these past years was so that we could ensure the security of a free state and protect the people from an oppressive government. And then it actually happened, and the whole rising up against a tyrannical government thing just totally slipped our minds, which is a little embarrassing,” a sheepish NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre said.

He said the morale around the NRA has been pretty low. “The guys feel pretty silly. We had our well regulated militia stocked up and ready to go, just waiting for the moment when the Government would turn on its own people. And then the government started shooting protesters and rolling tanks down the street, and we were like ‘guys this is the one we’ve been talking about, let’s go!’. But then something else came up and we forgot to do it. Damnit!”.

Observers were shocked that the NRA had missed their opportunity to defend their country. “I can’t believe it,” one analyst said. “It’s almost as if they weren’t worried about the government at all. It’s as if they were actually just scared of black people”.

kxy82n	libertarian	Don't Let the Capitol Riot Become a 9/11-Style Excuse for Authoritarianism	"After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, horrified Americans were ready to embrace virtually any proposal that promised to keep them safe. Government officials, for their part, were eager to curry favor with the fearful public and saw an opportunity to promote legislation and policies that had failed to win support in the past. The result was a surge of authoritarianism from which the U.S. has yet to recover. Now—with the public understandably concerned after the January 6 storming of the Capitol—we should brace ourselves for another wave of political responses that would, again, erode our liberty.

""We're going to have to figure out how we rein in our media environment so that you can't just spew disinformation and misinformation,"" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) told her Instagram followers this week. ""It's one thing to have differing opinions but it's another thing entirely to just say things that are false. So that's something that we're looking into.""

The socialist lawmaker isn't always careful about her words, but it's worrying when officials talk about a need to ""rein in"" the media in any context. There's really no way to cast government action to that end in a good light, no matter what policy tools are intended (Ocasio-Cortez's office hasn't responded to a request for comment). To let government agencies ""rein in"" the media is to put control over speech and the press in the hands of people who always see benefit in less scrutiny and criticism of their own activities.

That free speech might well take a hit is apparent from the pasting law enforcement is getting for, allegedly, being too considerate of First Amendment rights before the events at the Capitol.

""FBI intelligence analysts gathered information about possible violence involving the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6., but the FBI never distributed a formal intelligence bulletin, in part because of concerns that doing so might have run afoul of free speech protections,"" NBC News reported on Tuesday.

The report goes on to reveal that in preparing for the protest that degenerated into a riot, the FBI did share intelligence with other law enforcement agencies, neglecting only to issue a formal Joint Intelligence Bulletin. But the overall impression left by NBC and by the behind-the-scenes leaks from officialdom on which its reporting is based are that respect for free speech got in the way.

Since then, the FBI has made up for lost time, issuing a bulletin highlighting the ""threat of violence"" from a range of ""ideologically diverse"" extremists. The danger is real, as the violence of January 6 demonstrated. But so is the danger of an unrestrained federal agency with a history of interference in domestic policy debates, spying on activists, and even trying to sabotage political parties—revealed in great detail by the 1976 Church Committee report. An FBI stung for being too respectful of individual rights in the recent past may return to its old habits in the future.

In its efforts, the FBI and its allied agencies are almost certain to have the support of the new president. After the storming of the Capitol, President-elect Joe Biden was harsh in his description of the participants. ""Don't dare call them protesters,"" he said. ""They were a riotous mob. Insurrectionists. Domestic terrorists. It's that basic. It's that simple.""

Biden's choice of language is interesting because, even before the election, his campaign promised to ""work for a domestic terrorism law""—an idea reportedly favored by his close advisors. What a new law would look like isn't clear, but Biden has a history with such legislation.

After the 9/11 attacks, Biden claimed authorship of the Patriot Act, which has been much criticized for the damage it does to civil liberties in the name of combating foreign terrorism. ""I drafted a terrorism bill after the Oklahoma City bombing,"" he told The New Republic in October 2001. ""And the bill John Ashcroft sent up was my bill.""

The uses to which the Patriot Act has been put since its passage should be warning enough to be wary of any legislation proposed in response to the events of January 6.

""The Patriot Act was the first of many changes to surveillance laws that made it easier for the government to spy on ordinary Americans by expanding the authority to monitor phone and email communications, collect bank and credit reporting records, and track the activity of innocent Americans on the Internet,"" the American Civil Liberties Union summarizes. ""While most Americans think it was created to catch terrorists, the Patriot Act actually turns regular citizens into suspects.""

""This is really a debate about the standard our government should have to meet in order to obtain personal information about individuals from banks, hospitals, libraries, retail stores, gun shops, and other institutions,"" Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) argued about ongoing controversies surround the Patriot Act in 2011. ""Government agents should not be able to collect this sort of information on law abiding American citizens without showing that they have at least some connection to terrorism or other nefarious activities.""

Twenty years after its passage, the Patriot Act lingers on, still threatening civil liberties.

""The government has interpreted a high-profile provision of the Patriot Act as empowering F.B.I. national security investigators to collect logs showing who has visited particular web pages,"" Charlie Savage of The New York Times reported just last month. ""New tensions have emerged over the extent to which the F.B.I. could use that law to gather logs of people's web browsing activities, as opposed to using warrants — a tool that requires investigators to first be able to produce evidence that a person probably engaged in wrongdoing,"" he added.

Despite much moaning about the absence of a domestic terrorism law, the Patriot Act has had considerable and very intrusive domestic impact on Americans' privacy.

The fallout from 9/11 also brought us amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which authorized mass surveillance campaigns that were exposed by Edward Snowden and ruled unconstitutional only last September. We saw the establishment of the simultaneously creepy and incompetent Department of Homeland Security, and the further transformation of air travel into an ordeal under the groping guidance of the Transportation Security Administration. All of this was presented to a frightened public as part of a necessary response to the attacks in hopes that nobody would notice that the proposals had been gathering dust on shelves, just waiting for an opening.

""Many of the changes have precious little to do with the dangers that we saw on September 11,"" George Washington University Law School's Jonathan Turley told PBS in 2002. ""Many of those things are part of a wish list of intelligence agencies that they've wanted for decades.""

Given that government officials' wish list of expanded powers are endless, and that they were calling for new laws well before the storming of the Capitol, we should expect a flurry of legislative proposals in the weeks and months to come. We'll need to scrutinize them very closely, on the assumption that they'll be as dangerous to freedom as past schemes to protect us from risks real and imagined."	right
kyjy9f	libertarian	Rand Paul: One-third of Republicans will leave party if GOP senators go along with convicting Trump	"Sen. Rand Paul warned of a mass exodus from the Republican Party if GOP senators come together with Democrats to convict President Trump in a second impeachment trial, even after he leaves office next week.

The Kentucky Republican told Fox News host Laura Ingraham that he believes one-third of the party will leave if Trump's conviction comes to fruition. Paul added that he believes the second impeachment is ""purely a partisan thing.""

""I didn’t agree with the fight that happened last week. I voted against over-turning the election,"" Paul said Friday night. ""But at the same time, the impeachment is a wrongheaded, partisan notion. If Republicans go along with it, it will destroy the party. A third of the Republicans will leave the party.""

Trump was impeached by the Democrat-controlled House on Wednesday, after being charged with ""incitement of insurrection"" following the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol that left five people dead.

Ten House Republicans got on board to vote for Trump's impeachment, making him the first U.S. president in history to be impeached twice.

The president was impeached on two Ukraine-related articles of impeachment in the House in December 2019, but he was acquitted by the Senate early last year. At the time, Mitt Romney of Utah was the sole Republican senator to vote in favor of one of the articles of impeachment against Trump, becoming the first senator ever to vote for the impeachment of a president from the same party.

Convicting Trump in the Senate requires a two-thirds vote (or 67 senators). The Senate will be split 50-50 with Democrats and the two independents who caucus with them having a tie-breaker in Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.

Trump will leave office on Wednesday and will be succeeded by President-elect Joe Biden. The president has said that he will not attend the inauguration and is expected to leave Washington before the event begins."	right
jf0mtk	libertarian	AOC Wants To Work With Republicans To Legalize Marijuana And End War On Drugs	"The head of a top federal drug agency is criticizing the ongoing policy of criminalizing people for drug use and is suggesting that the government should instead consider a policy of decriminalization.

Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), penned an essay for the journal Health Affairs that’s titled “Addiction Should Be Treated, Not Penalized.” It lays out the case against incarcerating people over low-level drug offenses and looking at the issue as a public health matter.

While it stops short of explicitly endorsing decriminalization, Volkow says that the current system leads to disproportionate enforcement against communities of color and can actually increase the risk of overdose deaths.

“Drug use continues to be penalized, despite the fact that punishment does not ameliorate substance use disorders or related problems,” she said. “Imprisonment, whether for drug or other offenses, actually leads to much higher risk of drug overdose upon release.”

“We have known for decades that addiction is a medical condition—a treatable brain disorder—not a character flaw or a form of social deviance,” Volkow continued in the essay, which was first published by Health Affairs late last month and republished on NIDA’s website on Friday. “Yet, despite the overwhelming evidence supporting that position, drug addiction continues to be criminalized. The US must take a public health approach to drug addiction now, in the interest of both population well-being and health equity.”

In @Health_Affairs blog, Dr. Volkow makes the evidence-based case on how drug #criminalization disproportionately harms Black communities & exacerbates health disparities. A public health approach to #addiction is needed. https://t.co/6w1awINIRb pic.twitter.com/ty9GfrlWtg — NIDAnews (@NIDAnews) April 27, 2021

The NIDA head pointed out how people of color have been “disproportionately harmed by decades of addressing drug use as a crime rather than as a matter of public health.” Citing disparities in how opioid criminalization has been enforced and laws punishing crack more harshly than powder cocaine, Volkow said these are examples of “racial discrimination that have long been associated with drug laws and their policing.”

What makes these admissions notable is the source from which they’re coming. While NIDA is known among advocates as a source of resistance to reforms such as ending marijuana prohibition, its director sides with them on the fundamental principle that substance misuse should not be criminalized.

“The damaging impacts of punishment for drug possession that disproportionately impact Black lives are wide ranging. Imprisonment leads to isolation, an exacerbating factor for drug misuse, addiction, and relapse,” the director said. “It also raises the risk of early death from a wide variety of causes.”

Volkow also said that beyond incarceration, merely being arrested for marijuana possession “can leave the individual with a criminal record that severely limits their future opportunities such as higher education and employment.” And that enforcement trend hurts black people more than white people despite comparable rates of consumption.

“This burden reinforces poverty by limiting upward mobility through impeded access to employment, housing, higher education, and eligibility to vote,” she said. “It also harms the health of the incarcerated, their non-incarcerated family members, and their communities.”

These statements ostensibly lend themselves to a harm reduction policy position in favor of decriminalization, but Volkow doesn’t specifically say that’s the route lawmakers should take. Instead, she says that research “is urgently needed to establish the effectiveness and impact of public health–based alternatives to criminalization, ranging from drug courts and other diversion programs to policies decriminalizing drug possession.”

To that end, NIDA is “redoubling its focus on vulnerabilities and progression of substance use and addiction in minority populations,” she said. “We are exploring research partnerships with state and local agencies and private health systems to develop ways to eliminate systemic barriers to addiction care.”

The agency is “also funding research on the effects of alternative models of regulating and decriminalizing drugs in parts of the world where such natural experiments are already occurring,” Volkow said, presumably referencing countries such as Portugal that have stopped criminalizing people over simple possession.

“People with substance use disorders need treatment, not punishment, and drug use disorders should be approached with a demand for high-quality care and with compassion for those affected,” she said. “With a will to achieve racial equity in delivering compassionate treatment and the ability to use science to guide us toward more equitable models of addressing addiction, I believe such a goal is achievable.”

While NIDA might not be widely considered a champion of progressive drug policy, its director has previously conceded that existing federal drug laws aren’t working.

In 2019, for example, she acknowledged that the Schedule I status of marijuana and other drugs makes it “very difficult” for researchers to study the benefits and risks of those substances.

“Indeed, the moment that a drug gets a Schedule I, which is done in order to protect the public so that they don’t get exposed to it, it makes research much harder,” Volkow said during a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing. “This is because [researchers] actually have to through a registration process that is actually lengthy and cumbersome.”

She also discussed the potential benefits and risks of cannabis at a congressional hearing last year.

NIDA is also one of the main agencies behind a new development in federally sanctioned marijuana research. After requesting public input last year on a standard THC unit for cannabis studies, it announced last week that it had reached a determination to set the standard at five milligrams of THC per dosage."	right

jlleof	libertarian	Biden Team Cancels Texas Event After Highway ‘Ambush’ by MAGA Cavalry	"Joe Biden’s presidential campaign canceled a Friday event in Austin, Texas, after harassment from a pro-Trump contingent.

Texas has emerged as a battleground state in Tuesday’s presidential election, with polls showing the typically Republican stronghold now only marginally favoring President Donald Trump. The Biden campaign scheduled a Friday event in the state, in a bid to drum up last-minute support.

But when the Biden campaign bus drove to Austin, it was greeted by a blockade of pro-Trump demonstrators, leading to what one Texas House representative described as an escalation “well beyond safe limits.”

The cancelation comes amid national anxiety about voter intimidation, a tactic the Trump campaign has implicitly endorsed.

Historian Dr. Eric Cervini was driving to help with the Biden campaign stop when he filmed a line of pickup trucks along the highway, many of them flying Trump flags. The drivers were “waiting to ambush the Biden/Harris campaign bus as it traveled from San Antonio to Austin,” Cervini tweeted.

“These Trump supporters, many of whom were armed, surrounded the bus on the interstate and attempted to drive it off the road,” he alleged. “They outnumbered police 50-1, and they ended up hitting a staffer’s car.”

A Biden campaign staffer told The Daily Beast that Trump supporters surrounded the bus on the highway and slowed down in front of it, attempting to stop it or run it off the road. The official sent a picture taken on the bus, showing Trump trucks surrounding the front of the vehicle. Staffers on the bus called police, who helped the bus reach its destination.

Video from the highway shows trucks surrounding the bus, at one point colliding with an SUV.

Footage from a CBS affiliate in Austin shows Trump supporters with signs and bullhorns surrounding the bus when it parked, with one person screaming that Biden was a communist.

Rep. Sheryl Cole, a Democrat representing nearby Pflugerville in Texas’s House, announced that a Biden event in her city had been canceled due to the harassment.

“This is a 1st for me - but we just cancelled a joint event in Pflugerville w/ @JoeBiden campaign,

@AustinYoungDems, & more, due to security reasons,” she tweeted. “Unfortunately, Pro-Trump Protestors have escalated well beyond safe limits. Sorry to all who looked forward to this fun event.”

The Biden campaign’s Texas communications director, Tariq Thowfeek, said holding the event would have placed Biden staffers and supporters at risk.

“Rather than engage in productive conversation about the drastically different visions that Joe Biden and Donald Trump have for our country, Trump supporters in Texas today instead decided to put our staff, surrogates, supporters, and others in harm’s way,” Thowfeek told The Daily Beat.

“Our supporters will continue to organize their communities for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Democrats up and down the ballot, and to the Texans who disrupted our events today: We’ll see you on November 3rd.”

The Trump campaign—and often Trump himself—has encouraged in-person conflict around the polls. Trump used the first presidential debate to urge supporters to act as “poll watchers,” a call that sparked concerns of voter intimidation. His son, Donald Trump Jr., made an explicit call-out regarding the Biden campaign’s Texas outreach efforts.

In a video ahead of a Friday event by Biden’s running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, Trump Jr. encouraged his father’s supporters to show up at Harris’s event.

“Hey Laredo, Don Jr. here,” he said. “I heard you had an awesome turnout for the Trump Train. It’d be great if you guys would all get together, head down to McAllen and give Kamala Harris a nice Trump Train welcome. Get out there, have some fun, enjoy it. Don’t forget to vote and bring all of your friends. Let’s show them how strong Texas still is as Trump country. Get out there, guys.”

Some Trump supporters appeared to heed the call. At least one Facebook event with more than 700 responses, viewed by The Daily Beast, encouraged Trump fans to attend a Harris event in Fort Worth, Texas on Friday and “give Kamala Harris a big Texas welcome..... TRUMP STYLE!” The event was listed as canceled ahead of time, although its organizers acknowledged that some people might still try to attend, “and that's your right.”

On Saturday, the president himself relished in news of the MAGA contingent harassing Biden’s campaign bus, retweeting video of the incident along with the caption, “I LOVE TEXAS!”

Trump supporters have previously been accused of intimidation this election. In Beverly Hills, California this week, an Australian television personality filmed participants at a pro-Trump rally shouting at her and threatening her in her car. A man brandishing a Trump flag at her appeared to photograph her and take down her license plate number.

“We’ve got you now,” the man shouted. “You’re going to vote for Trump whether you like it or not, you’ve got no choice.”

When Biden spoke at a Minnesota event on Friday, the same day as his campaign was ambushed in Austin, Trump supporters in a caravan of vehicles reportedly surrounded the venue honking their horns and chanting.

During early voting in the swing state of Virginia late last month, a caravan of Trump supporters drove to the Democratic-leaning Fairfax County and surrounded people in an early voting line, shouting at them on loudspeakers

“We had a couple poll observers there that had to actually escort voters in because we saw people that would get to the edge of the parking lot, and see this giant group of Trumpers yelling and screaming,” the executive director of the Fairfax County Democratic Committee told The Daily Beast at the time."	right

hoo7fn	libertarian	Louisiana man is serving life without parole for selling $30 worth of weed.	"This Louisiana Gulf War Veteran Is Serving Life For Selling $30 Worth Of Marijuana

Derek Harris awaits arguments in the state Supreme Court about the sentencing, which one judge called ‘unconscionable.’

On Oct. 2, 2008, a teenage boy in Abbeville, Louisiana, led an undercover police officer to his mother’s small shack on the poor side of town to make a small purchase of marijuana from his mother’s partner. There, the officer purchased .69 grams of marijuana for $30 from Derek Harris, an unemployed Army veteran.

Four months later, a warrant was issued for Harris’s arrest. Then, in July 2009, the District Attorney’s Office for Louisiana’s 15th Judicial District, which serves Vermilion, Acadia, and Lafayette parishes, charged Harris with distributing marijuana. Harris posted his bond and then spent nearly three years waiting for his trial to begin. He elected to have a trial by judge instead of facing a jury, and on June 26, 2012, a judge found Harris guilty and later imposed a 15-year prison sentence.

Then, prosecutors with the district attorney’s office filed a habitual offender bill of information based on Harris’s prior convictions. On Nov. 15, 2012, Judge Durwood Conque resentenced Harris to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.

Louisiana’s habitual offender statute allows prosecutors to file to have a punishment enhanced based on a person’s criminal history. The statute has long played a role in the state’s notoriously long sentences and high incarceration rate. In 2016, Louisiana had one of the nation’s highest rates of people sentenced to life without parole, according to the Sentencing Project. In 2017, The state legislature enacted habitual offender reform which reduced maximum sentences triggered by a fourth offense.

While incarcerated at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, Harris challenged the excessiveness of his sentence and argued that he did not receive effective legal representation as required by the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Harris now hopes to find relief in a petition he filed with the state Supreme Court on May 23, 2018.

“Nothing that he did deserved life without the possibility of parole,” Harris’s older brother Antoine Harris said in a phone interview. “I’ll be the first to say he made bad decisions. You reap what you sow, most of the time. But if you’re going to reap something, it should match what you’ve sown.”

Prosecutors wielded the habitual offender statute because of a string of prior convictions including distribution of cocaine, simple robbery, and theft of property worth less than $500. His family members insist, however, that the untreated substance use disorder Harris developed after serving in the Army during the Gulf War in the early 1990s contributed to these petty offenses.

But prosecutors have the discretion to not file a habitual offender bill of information, and Harris’s family and post-conviction attorney say that ineffective assistance of counsel by his public defender also played a part in his harsh sentence. “Had my family or, perhaps, someone close to my brother had the financial means to not have him with a court-appointed attorney, maybe the outcome would’ve been different,” Antoine said. “If everything worked out accordingly, he’d be a free man working now and doing whatever he could to better his life.”

More than a year before Harris’s 2012 trial, prosecutors extended a plea offer of seven years in prison. But Jan Rowe, Harris’s trial counsel, never communicated that offer to him, Harris later alleged in a post-conviction legal challenge. When prosecutors came back with a 10-year offer, Harris says he informed Rowe that he was willing to accept the deal.

Harris’s stance on the deal from prosecutors apparently never got back to the DA’s office. Before trial in 2012, a new prosecutor who took over Harris’s case rescinded the 10-year offer and set out the terms of another deal: 30 years in prison, even though the statute allowed for a five-to 30-year sentence. Harris declined that offer and then faced a trial that may have permanently cost him his freedom.

On Dec. 11, 2013, Louisiana’s Third Circuit Court of Appeal ruled against Harris’s claim of excessiveness in sentencing. But in a dissenting opinion, Judge Sylvia Cooks said the sentence was “bereft of fundamental fairness.”

“I believe it is unconscionable to impose a life-sentence-without-benefit upon this Defendant who served his country on the field of battle and returned home to find his country offered him no help for his drug addiction problem.” Cooks wrote. “It is an incomprehensible, needless, tragic waste of a human life for the sake of slavish adherence to the technicalities of law.”

Harris had legal representation “in name only” and Rowe did not provide effective counsel to his client at pivotal stages in the case, said Cormac Boyle, an attorney now representing Harris in his writ of certiorari filed with the state Supreme Court.

“The sheer harshness of the Mr. Harris’ life without parole as an enhancement for selling .69 grams ($30 worth) of marijuana truly shocks the conscience,” Boyle wrote in briefing filed with the court on Sept. 9 of this year. “Now, the state wants to deprive him of any remedy for these wrongs.”

In a phone interview with The Appeal from his home in North Carolina, Rowe said he negotiated with prosecutors over a plea offer for Harris “probably three or four times.” But Rowe acknowledged that he had trouble keeping track of Harris, which he blamed on his client’s substance use disorder. He said he lost track of Harris for about two years until right just before the DA’s office offered its deal of 30 years, which Harris declined.

“Personally, I think that he had a future, if he would’ve given up the drugs,” Rowe said. “I knew several lawyers that went to school with him and they all said he was a great guy, great athlete, all that stuff. I really consider this the worst case I’ve ever had. I was shattered that he didn’t help himself, for the longest time. It didn’t have to happen like that.”

The DA’s office also disputes the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. In filings with the state Supreme Court, they argued that the seven-year deal was communicated to Rowe, who dutifully noted the deal and other developments in his client’s case file. Prosecutors further argued that the seven-year offer did not come with a commitment that they would “forgo a habitual offender prosecution” and is not excessive because it is in accordance with state law.

“Arguing over the length of the jail term offered is pointless,” Calvin Woodruff, an assistant DA for the 15th Judicial District, wrote in an Aug. 19 brief with the court.

As of publication time, arguments in Harris case before the Supreme Court have yet to be scheduled.

On the day in June 2012 that Judge Conque sentenced Harris to life in prison without parole, his mother stood before the court and offered a plea for mercy.

“My son is not a drug dealer,” she said, according to Harris’s brother Antoine. “What he sold the cop that literally went into the neighborhood posing as a drug addict was the equivalent of a joint or two.”

“And the judge stepped in and told my mother point blank,” Antoine recalled. “He said, ‘Ms. Harris, one joint or two joints, he sold it. He’s a drug dealer.’”

“To me, a piece of her life was gone then,” Antoine said. “She had a broken heart, you know, because one of her kids is locked up in a cage for the rest of his life for nothing more than petty drug crimes.”

But Antoine says that Derek still clings to hope that he will be freed from Angola. Although their mother died in 2015, at least Derek may one day visit her grave, he said."	right
icq1an	libertarian	Americans Dislike Both Biden and Trump	"On the opening night of the Democratic National Convention, former First Lady Michelle Obama begged voters to resist the urge to refrain from voting or to vote for third-party candidates. ""This is not the time to withhold our votes in protest or play games with candidates who have no chance of winning,"" the former first lady exhorted whatever audience, perhaps out of masochism, chose to tune in to the virtual convention.

It was a fitting moment of desperation—and one that should be echoed at the Republican convention—given the disdain many Americans hold for the presidential candidates of both legacy parties. Once again, we're being asked to pick between candidates that just aren't up to the job.

""As both political parties prepare for their conventions, one in four Americans do not think either of the major-party presidential candidates would be a good president,"" Gallup noted last week. ""The current percentage saying neither candidate would make a good president is the highest on record.""

Unfortunately, one of those hopefuls is almost certain to win or retain power over a government that has too much say in our lives.

It's no wonder that in 2016, millions of voters picked Libertarian Gary Johnson or Green Jill Stein or declined to vote at all rather than choose between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. That year, the Democratic and Republican nominees headed into Election Day ""with the worst election-eve images of any major-party presidential candidates Gallup has measured back to 1956.""

The 2020 election represents an ongoing demonstration that America's governing apparatus is trapped in the embrace of the rotting corpses of once-dynamic political organizations. Democratic and Republican Party hearts and minds may have died, but they refuse to loosen their grip on political office—and on voters.

And, out of habit or old lessons remembered too long, most Americans dutifully confine their choices to these two moldering options, no matter how unpleasant the task. The result, as The New York Times reported in June, is ""the second straight presidential contest in which both candidates are viewed negatively by a majority of voters.""

How negatively?

Both legacy party candidates are underwater, favorability-wise. According to Gallup, just 47 percent of Americans view Biden favorably and 42 percent view Trump favorably,

With those kinds of numbers, non-party-loyalists who feel absolutely compelled to pick between the zombie Democrats and zombie Republicans are going more by who they oppose than by enthusiasm for the nominees themselves.

""Half of the nation's electorate says they have ruled out voting for Donald Trump in November, while 4 in 10 say the same about Joe Biden,"" the Monmouth University Polling Institute found last month. ""Overall, 21% of all registered voters do not have a favorable opinion of either party's nominee.""

That process of elimination doesn't mean that voters ruling out one legacy party nominee are binding themselves to the other. There are alternatives: Libertarian Party candidate Jo Jorgensen, a psychology lecturer, seems an apropos alternative as the high-profile candidates credibly accuse each other of senility; the Green Party's Howie Hawkins is neither Biden nor Trump; and millions of voters will completely take a pass on casting a ballot in-person, by mail, or in any other way.

But chances are that either Donald Trump will retain the presidency, or Joe Biden will displace him. And all the signs point to many Americans casting their votes not for the candidate they like, but rather against the candidate they dislike.

Hate-voting is a growing phenomenon in American politics. ""Hostility toward the opposing party has eclipsed positive affect for ones' own party as a motive for political participation,"" researchers reported in a 2018 paper published by Political Psychology. The authors of that paper, Shanto Iyengar and Masha Krupenkin, also found that ""while partisan animus began to rise in the 1980s, it has grown dramatically over the past two decades.""

It's this hostility to political opponents that apparently sustains what's left of the legacy parties—not for their own sakes, but as counters to the despised opposition. People may not like their own standard-bearers very much, but they prop them up as weapons against the other side.

Alan Abramowitz and Steven Webster, political scientists at Emory University, call this ""negative partisanship—the phenomenon whereby Americans largely align against one party instead of affiliating with the other."" In a 2018 paper, they describe negative partisanship as ""one of the most important developments in American politics over the last 40 years.""

Hate-voting is a hell of a way to run a semi-functioning democracy. It suggests that the government is on ground as shaky as that occupied by the legacy political parties.

""The fact that so many Americans in both the last election and this one have expressed an aversion to each of the major candidates speaks to the heavy polarization that now defines the national electorate—not to mention the wholesale disillusionment many voters feel with the political system,"" The New York Times's Giovanni Russonello observed.

Perhaps—just a thought here—a political system in which so many Americans have lost faith is one that shouldn't exercise as much power over people's lives as does the government with which we're saddled. When millions of Americans who will have to live with the outcome of the election ""do not think either of the major-party presidential candidates would be a good president,"" it's a good sign that the consequences of elections should be less important.

Getting Americans to like each other, let alone doddering legacy party political candidates, is a goal beyond anybody's reach. But making government less important might lower the stakes a bit so that it doesn't matter all that much when unfit candidates win office."	right
koc6jw	libertarian	Trump’s legacy: $8 trillion-plus in added debt in one term	"President Trump promised in the 2016 campaign to eliminate the federal debt over a two-term presidency. That pledge won't come to fruition, and, in fact, he will leave office having added massively to the debt.

“His tenure has been marked by a total disregard for any concern about mounting debt,” said Jim Capretta, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C.

When Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2017, the total national debt was nearly $20 trillion, according to the Treasury Department. It has increased over roughly 30% since, nearly $8 trillion, to $27 trillion, as of Monday.

For comparison, President Barack Obama added roughly $9 trillion to the national debt during his eight years in office, according to the Treasury Department.

Before Trump took office, he railed against the debt. Shortly before winning the White House, he likened its high level to a “time bomb.”

“I will tell you, we are sitting on a time bomb,” he told CBS in June 2016, adding that “I don’t like debt for the country.”

Trump in 2016 vowed to eliminate the federal debt over an eight-year period. At the time, the federal government's debt was over $19 trillion, and most economists thought Trump's pledge ludicrous.

To Capretta, Trump’s actions have been fiscally reckless.

“Trump saw that it would be to his political advantage to be very liberal in terms of spending and tax reductions happening simultaneously,” he said.

In his first year of entering office, Trump signed into law a tax overhaul bill that added $1.9 trillion to the debt over a 10-year period, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the bookkeeper for Congress.

He also increased annual spending, by nearly $800 billion, from $3.85 trillion in 2016 to $4.65 trillion in 2020 (before pandemic relief), according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan organization that examines the spending habits in Washington.

Then came the federal response to the pandemic, which drained federal coffers by $1.76 trillion, according to the CBO.

Obama, too, increased spending to address a crisis, namely the Great Recession. He signed into law the ""American Recovery and Reinvestment Act,"" also known as the stimulus, that added $787 billion to the annual deficit. The deficit is the difference between spending and revenues in a given year, while the debt represents accrued deficits.

Trump signed all of these bills into law without trying to reduce the amount of red ink that he was creating, according to Capretta.

“He never really pressed any kind of fiscal policy onto Congress,” he said.

Congress plays an integral role in the tax cuts and spending increases that are enacted into law and could have pressed for more fiscal responsibility in the bills that were passed.

Meanwhile, the trajectory of the debt is upward, according to the CBO. By the end of 2020, federal debt held by the public is projected to equal 98% of GDP, compared to 79% at the end of 2019 and 35% at the end of 2007."	right
mpm4z0	libertarian	Being so poorly trained that you don't know the difference between a taser and a gun is not a defense for murder	"The police chief of a Minneapolis suburb said Monday he believes one of the department's officers wanted to use a Taser but mistakenly drew her service weapon before she fatally shot a Black man point-blank during a traffic stop the day before.

The Brooklyn Center Police Department released body-camera video of Sunday's encounter, which ended in the death of Daunte Wright, 20, who was shot in the suburb about 14 miles north of where George Floyd was killed last year.

The video appeared to show Wright getting out of his car and then getting back in as officers tried to apprehend him on an undisclosed outstanding misdemeanor warrant that they discovered after they pulled him over.

As Wright got back into his car, a female voice could be heard shouting ""Taser!"" before Wright was shot, video appeared to show.

That same female voice could be heard saying, ""Holy s--- I just shot him,"" as the car pulled away, police said.

The Minnesota Department of Public Safety Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which is investigating the shooting, Monday night identified the officer as Kim Potter, a 26-year department veteran.

Wright died of a gunshot wound to the chest, according to the Hennepin County Medical Examiner, which classified the manner of death as a homicide.

Police Chief Tim Gannon said he believes it is clear the officer meant to draw a Taser but ""drew their handgun instead of their Taser.""

""As I watched the video and listened to the officer's commands, it is my belief the officer had the intention to deploy their Taser but instead shot Mr. Wright with a single bullet,"" Gannon told reporters. ""This appears to me from what I viewed and the officer's reaction in distress immediately after that this was an accidental discharge that resulted in a tragic death of Mr. Wright.""

Mayor Mike Elliott said he wants the officer, who has been placed on administrative leave, fired.

""We cannot afford to make mistakes that lead to the loss of life,"" Elliott said. ""I do fully support releasing the officer of her duties.""

Gannon stopped just short of agreeing with the mayor's call to terminate her, but he strongly hinted that she will not be back on the job.

""That officer is afforded due process just like anybody else does. She has the right to be heard. She has the right to give her statement. She has the right to tell what she felt, what she thought,"" Gannon said.

""She will not be returning to duty until this investigation has run its course. And for all intents and purposes, I think we can look at the video and ascertain whether she'll be returning,"" he said.

The shooting will be handled by the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. Gannon said he believes the state investigators would have disagreed with his decision to release the body-cam video.

""The releasing of video this early ... is not something that they condone,"" Gannon said. ""I felt the community needed to know what happened. They needed to see it. I needed to be transparent, and I wanted to be forthright.""

Unrest from the deadly incident prompted Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to announce a 7 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew for Hennepin, Ramsey and Anoka counties, which cover the greater Twin Cities.

After curfew Monday, there were clashes between crowds and police. Fireworks were set off, and bangs, which were accompanied by smoke or gas, were heard.

Around 9:40 p.m., police in riot gear and an armored vehicle pushed down a street near the police department, sending people running. There were a series of loud bangs and gas or smoke. Video showed a line of police pushing people from a shopping center parking lot, where at least one store appeared to have been damaged.

Protesters chanted ""say his name"" and ""no justice, no peace."" One demonstrator said she had a hard time understanding how an officer could have mistaken a handgun for a Taser, noting the difference in weight. ""I've shot a gun. I've held a Taser,"" she said. ""I'm a beginner shooter, I can tell the difference.""

About 40 people were arrested, Minnesota State Patrol Col. Matt Langer said early Tuesday. Some sporadic looting happened near the police department, officials said. A few officers suffered minor injuries from thrown debris, Langer said. He was not aware of injuries to any demonstrators.

Elliot also announced efforts to reorganize the city's government on Monday. The Brooklyn Center City Manager Curt Boganey was ""relieved of his duties"" Elliot tweeted, but did not cite a reason for the ousting. Boganey would not commit to saying whether he believed the officer who shot Wright should be fired when asked by reporters on Monday afternoon, according to NBC affiliate KARE.

Elliot's office will also oversee the police department after a 3-2 vote from city council.

""At such a tough time, this will streamline things and establish a chain of command and leadership,"" Elliot said. ""I appreciate the other councilmembers who voted to approve this motion.""

'Initial details are troubling'

Wright called his mother, Katie Wright, asking for the car's insurance information shortly after he was pulled over, she told reporters Sunday. She said police had pulled him over for having an air freshener hanging from his rearview mirror, which is illegal in Minnesota.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota said in a statement: ""Initial details are troubling. Wright's mother told several news outlets that she was on the phone with her son when he was pulled over for having a dangling air freshener on his car rearview mirror. .... The ACLU-MN has deep concerns that police here appear to have used dangling air fresheners as an excuse for making a pretextual stop, something police do all too often to target Black people.""

Wright's family has hired civil rights lawyer Benjamin Crump, who is also representing Floyd's family. Crump said in a statement Monday that the country must mourn the loss of Wright even as people still grapple with the death of Floyd less than a year ago.

""This level of lethal force was entirely preventable and inhumane,"" Crump said. ""What will it take for law enforcement to stop killing people of color? The growing number of Black men and women who have been killed or harmed by police is far too hefty a price for the equality we are seeking.""

Today I’m thinking about Daunte Wright and his family — and the pain, anger, and trauma that Black America experiences every day. While we await a full investigation, we know what we need to do to move forward: rebuild trust and ensure accountability so no one is above the law. — President Biden (@POTUS) April 12, 2021

President Joe Biden said in a tweet that he was thinking about Wright's family and the ""pain, anger, and trauma that Black America experiences.""

""While we await a full investigation, we know what we need to do to move forward: rebuild trust and ensure accountability so no one is above the law,"" Biden said.

Governor urges peaceful protest

Walz, the governor, said Wright's death was yet another avoidable death of a Black man at the hands of a Minnesota police officer. He cited the fatal shootings of Philando Castile in 2016 and Jamar Clark in 2015.

A St. Anthony police officer was acquitted of second-degree manslaughter after Castile was gunned down in his car. Clark was fatally shot by a Minneapolis police officer, whose use of force was considered justified in the eyes of the law.

Minnesotans were already on edge as the trial of former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin has drawn so much attention.

The National Guard was mobilized to control a rock-throwing crowd that gathered Sunday in front of the Brooklyn Center Police Department by nightfall. Officers fired rubber bullets and tear gas.

Sunday's shooting played a role in Chauvin's case Monday as his attorney asked the judge to sequester jurors, fearing they could be influenced by the killing of another Black man by police.

The request was denied.

The Minnesota Twins, Timberwolves and Wild all postponed their baseball, basketball and hockey games, respectively, in light of the shooting and unrest."	right
idyke5	libertarian	"""All drugs, from magic mushrooms to marijuana to cocaine to heroin should be legal for medical or recreational use regardless of the negative effects to the person using them. It is simply not the business of government to protect people from physically, mentally, or spiritually harming themselves."""	"Scientifically speaking, mushrooms are said to be the fleshy, spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus, typically produced above ground, on soil, or on its food source. Typical are the button or common mushrooms classified as agaricus bisporus that are widely cultivated for food around the world. Governments don’t care how many of these mushrooms that anyone consumes.

All drugs, from magic mushrooms to marijuana to cocaine to heroin should be legal for medical or recreational use regardless of the negative effects to the person using them.

[Click to Tweet]

Some mushrooms are poisonous, and misidentifying them as an edible species of mushroom can be deadly or potentially deadly. The toxins alpha-Amanitin, orellanine, monomethylhydrazine, and ergotamine that are found in some mushrooms can cause fatal liver damage, kidney failure, brain damage, or cardiac arrest. Although eating a poisonous mushroom is not a crime, I don’t know of anyone who would deliberately eat one.

Other mushrooms have medicinal, psychoactive, or psychedelic properties. The most common are psilocybin mushrooms — magic mushrooms or shrooms — which can be found in subtropical humid forests in Europe, the Americas, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Ingesting magic mushrooms can send one on a “trip” with visual and auditory hallucinations, emotional changes, the inability to discern fantasy from reality, and altered perception of time and space. Side effects can include nausea, vomiting, euphoria, muscle weakness or relaxation, panic attacks, drowsiness, and lack of coordination. Governments around the world regulate or prohibit the consumption of psilocybin mushrooms.

Here in the United States, the Psychotropic Substances Act of 1978, which amended the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, was enacted to ensure compliance with the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances signed in 1971. Psilocybin is a Schedule I drug along with LSD, heroin, marijuana, and ecstasy. This means that the government believes it has “a high potential for abuse,” “no currently accepted medical treatment use in the U.S.,” and “a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision.”

It was reported late last year that there were nearly 100 jurisdictions in the United States where the decriminalization of psychedelics such as psilocybin either was being considered or was already in the works. Voters in Denver have already approved a ballot measure to decriminalize magic mushrooms. Initiated Ordinance 301 asked the question,

Shall the voters of the City and County of Denver adopt an ordinance to the Denver Revised Municipal Code that would make the personal use and personal possession of psilocybin mushrooms by persons twenty-one (21) years of age and older the city’s lowest law-enforcement priority, prohibit the city from spending resources to impose criminal penalties for the personal use and personal possession of psilocybin mushrooms by persons twenty-one (21) years of age and older, and establish the psilocybin mushroom policy review panel to assess and report on the effects of the ordinance?

The initiative passed by the slim margin of 50.64 percent to 49.36 percent.

Also last year, the Oakland City Council, by a unanimous vote, approved a measure decriminalizing the possession of “entheogenic” plant- and fungi-based substances. Under the terms of the measure, “entheogenic plant practices,” including the consumption of mushrooms, are now “amongst the lowest priority” for law enforcement, and the use of “any city funds or resources to assist in the enforcement of laws imposing criminal penalties” for adult use and possession is restricted.

And now, Washington, D.C., might decriminalize magic mushrooms.

The Decriminalize Nature D.C. campaign, which seeks to decriminalize “natural entheogenic substances,” recently submitted more than 35,000 signatures for a ballot measure to the D.C. Board of Elections. Initiative 81, the Entheogenic Plant and Fungus Policy Act of 2020, would “make investigation and arrest of adults for … engaging in practices with entheogenic plants and fungi among the lowest law enforcement priorities for the District of Columbia.” The initiative would decriminalize only naturally occurring psychedelics, such as N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), mescaline (found in peyote), and psilocybin (found in certain mushrooms and truffles). It would not actually reduce any fines or penalties for using or possessing psychedelics, but it would direct law enforcement to focus on more-pressing issues. The initiative also includes a nonbinding call for both the D.C. Attorney General and the federal U.S. Attorney for D.C. to drop prosecutions of people for “non-commercial planting, non-commercial cultivating, purchasing, transporting, distributing” or possessing “entheogenic” plants and fungi.

If at least 25,000 signatures of the signatures collected are verified, voters will decide in November whether to decriminalize magic mushrooms and other “natural entheogenic substances.”

Now, consuming magic mushrooms might be weird, crazy, unhealthy, dangerous, immoral, or addictive; it might even be all of those things and more — but since when is it the business of government at any level to prevent people from doing things that might be weird, crazy, unhealthy, dangerous, immoral, or addictive? That is the real issue.

We are not talking about people who sell or feed magic mushrooms to children or pass off magic mushrooms as regular mushrooms. We are not talking about people who “trip” on magic mushrooms in the middle of a playground or while driving a school bus. We are not talking about people who “trip” on magic mushrooms and harm someone else, commit some act of violence, or violate someone’s property rights. We are talking about consenting adults who consume magic mushrooms on their own property and purchased with their own money. So again, since when is it the business of government at any level to prevent people from doing things that might be weird, crazy, unhealthy, dangerous, immoral, or addictive?

Since some freedom is better than no freedom, when cities make exceptions to their drug laws to allow people within their jurisdictions to consume magic mushrooms, it is always a good thing whether or not consuming magic mushrooms is itself a good thing.

It’s the same way with marijuana. Thirty-three states have legalized the medical use of marijuana and eleven states have legalized the recreational use of marijuana. When states make exceptions to their drug laws to allow people within their jurisdictions to use marijuana it is always a good thing whether or not using marijuana is itself a good thing.

But there shouldn’t have to be any exceptions made by any city or state regarding any drug. All drugs, from magic mushrooms to marijuana to cocaine to heroin should be legal for medical or recreational use regardless of the negative effects to the person using them. It is simply not the business of government to protect people from physically, mentally, or spiritually harming themselves."	right
j0za59	libertarian	Trump's taxes show chronic losses and years of tax avoidance - NYT	"The Times obtained Donald Trump’s tax information extending over more than two decades, revealing struggling properties, vast write-offs, an audit battle and hundreds of millions in debt coming due.

Donald J. Trump paid $750 in federal income taxes the year he won the presidency. In his first year in the White House, he paid another $750.

He had paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years — largely because he reported losing much more money than he made.

As the president wages a re-election campaign that polls say he is in danger of losing, his finances are under stress, beset by losses and hundreds of millions of dollars in debt coming due that he has personally guaranteed. Also hanging over him is a decade-long audit battle with the Internal Revenue Service over the legitimacy of a $72.9 million tax refund that he claimed, and received, after declaring huge losses. An adverse ruling could cost him more than $100 million.

The tax returns that Mr. Trump has long fought to keep private tell a story fundamentally different from the one he has sold to the American public. His reports to the I.R.S. portray a businessman who takes in hundreds of millions of dollars a year yet racks up chronic losses that he aggressively employs to avoid paying taxes. Now, with his financial challenges mounting, the records show that he depends more and more on making money from businesses that put him in potential and often direct conflict of interest with his job as president.

The New York Times has obtained tax-return data extending over more than two decades for Mr. Trump and the hundreds of companies that make up his business organization, including detailed information from his first two years in office. It does not include his personal returns for 2018 or 2019. This article offers an overview of The Times’s findings; additional articles will be published in the coming weeks.

The returns are some of the most sought-after, and speculated-about, records in recent memory. In Mr. Trump’s nearly four years in office — and across his endlessly hyped decades in the public eye — journalists, prosecutors, opposition politicians and conspiracists have, with limited success, sought to excavate the enigmas of his finances. By their very nature, the filings will leave many questions unanswered, many questioners unfulfilled. They comprise information that Mr. Trump has disclosed to the I.R.S., not the findings of an independent financial examination. They report that Mr. Trump owns hundreds of millions of dollars in valuable assets, but they do not reveal his true wealth. Nor do they reveal any previously unreported connections to Russia.

In response to a letter summarizing The Times’s findings, Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said that “most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate” and requested the documents on which they were based. After The Times declined to provide the records, in order to protect its sources, Mr. Garten took direct issue only with the amount of taxes Mr. Trump had paid.

“Over the past decade, President Trump has paid tens of millions of dollars in personal taxes to the federal government, including paying millions in personal taxes since announcing his candidacy in 2015,” Mr. Garten said in a statement.

With the term “personal taxes,” however, Mr. Garten appears to be conflating income taxes with other federal taxes Mr. Trump has paid — Social Security, Medicare and taxes for his household employees. Mr. Garten also asserted that some of what the president owed was “paid with tax credits,” a misleading characterization of credits, which reduce a business owner’s income-tax bill as a reward for various activities, like historic preservation.

The tax data examined by The Times provides a road map of revelations, from write-offs for the cost of a criminal defense lawyer and a mansion used as a family retreat to a full accounting of the millions of dollars the president received from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow.

Together with related financial documents and legal filings, the records offer the most detailed look yet inside the president’s business empire. They reveal the hollowness, but also the wizardry, behind the self-made-billionaire image — honed through his star turn on “The Apprentice” — that helped propel him to the White House and that still undergirds the loyalty of many in his base.

Ultimately, Mr. Trump has been more successful playing a business mogul than being one in real life.

“The Apprentice,” along with the licensing and endorsement deals that flowed from his expanding celebrity, brought Mr. Trump a total of $427.4 million, The Times’s analysis of the records found. He invested much of that in a collection of businesses, mostly golf courses, that in the years since have steadily devoured cash — much as the money he secretly received from his father financed a spree of quixotic overspending that led to his collapse in the early 1990s.

Indeed, his financial condition when he announced his run for president in 2015 lends some credence to the notion that his long-shot campaign was at least in part a gambit to reanimate the marketability of his name.

As the legal and political battles over access to his tax returns have intensified, Mr. Trump has often wondered aloud why anyone would even want to see them. “There’s nothing to learn from them,” he told The Associated Press in 2016. There is far more useful information, he has said, in the annual financial disclosures required of him as president — which he has pointed to as evidence of his mastery of a flourishing, and immensely profitable, business universe.

In fact, those public filings offer a distorted picture of his financial state, since they simply report revenue, not profit. In 2018, for example, Mr. Trump announced in his disclosure that he had made at least $434.9 million. The tax records deliver a very different portrait of his bottom line: $47.4 million in losses.

Tax records do not have the specificity to evaluate the legitimacy of every business expense Mr. Trump claims to reduce his taxable income — for instance, without any explanation in his returns, the general and administrative expenses at his Bedminster golf club in New Jersey increased fivefold from 2016 to 2017. And he has previously bragged that his ability to get by without paying taxes “makes me smart,” as he said in 2016. But the returns, by his own account, undercut his claims of financial acumen, showing that he is simply pouring more money into many businesses than he is taking out.

The picture that perhaps emerges most starkly from the mountain of figures and tax schedules prepared by Mr. Trump’s accountants is of a businessman-president in a tightening financial vise.

Most of Mr. Trump’s core enterprises — from his constellation of golf courses to his conservative-magnet hotel in Washington — report losing millions, if not tens of millions, of dollars year after year.

His revenue from “The Apprentice” and from licensing deals is drying up, and several years ago he sold nearly all the stocks that now might have helped him plug holes in his struggling properties.

The tax audit looms.

And within the next four years, more than $300 million in loans — obligations for which he is personally responsible — will come due.

Against that backdrop, the records go much further toward revealing the actual and potential conflicts of interest created by Mr. Trump’s refusal to divest himself of his business interests while in the White House. His properties have become bazaars for collecting money directly from lobbyists, foreign officials and others seeking face time, access or favor; the records for the first time put precise dollar figures on those transactions.

At the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla., a flood of new members starting in 2015 allowed him to pocket an additional $5 million a year from the business. In 2017, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association paid at least $397,602 to the Washington hotel, where the group held at least one event during its four-day World Summit in Defense of Persecuted Christians.

The Times was also able to take the fullest measure to date of the president’s income from overseas, where he holds ultimate sway over American diplomacy. When he took office, Mr. Trump said he would pursue no new foreign deals as president. Even so, in his first two years in the White House, his revenue from abroad totaled $73 million. And while much of that money was from his golf properties in Scotland and Ireland, some came from licensing deals in countries with authoritarian-leaning leaders or thorny geopolitics — for example, $3 million from the Philippines, $2.3 million from India and $1 million from Turkey.

He reported paying taxes, in turn, on a number of his overseas ventures. In 2017, the president’s $750 contribution to the operations of the U.S. government was dwarfed by the $15,598 he or his companies paid in Panama, the $145,400 in India and the $156,824 in the Philippines.

The $750 Tax Bill Here’s how his accountants arrived at that figure in 2017.

Mr. Trump’s U.S. payment, after factoring in his losses, was roughly equivalent, in dollars not adjusted for inflation, to another presidential tax bill revealed nearly a half-century before. In 1973, The Providence Journal reported that, after a charitable deduction for donating his presidential papers, Richard M. Nixon had paid $792.81 in 1970 on income of about $200,000.

The leak of Mr. Nixon’s small tax payment caused a precedent-setting uproar: Henceforth, presidents, and presidential candidates, would make their tax returns available for the American people to see.

A Map of the Empire

The contents of thousands of personal and business tax records fill in financial details that have been withheld for years.

“I would love to do that,” Mr. Trump said in 2014 when asked whether he would release his taxes if he ran for president. He’s been backpedaling ever since.

When he ran, he said he might make his taxes public if Hillary Clinton did the same with the deleted emails from her private server — an echo of his taunt, while stoking the birther fiction, that he might release the returns if President Barack Obama released his birth certificate. He once boasted that his tax returns were “very big” and “beautiful.” But making them public? “It’s very complicated.” He often claims that he cannot do so while under audit — an argument refuted by his own I.R.S. commissioner. When prosecutors and congressional investigators issued subpoenas for his returns, he wielded not just his private lawyers but also the power of his Justice Department to stalemate them all the way to the Supreme Court.

Mr. Trump’s elaborate dance and defiance have only stoked suspicion about what secrets might lie hidden in his taxes. Is there a financial clue to his deference to Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin? Did he write off as a business expense the hush-money payment to the pornographic film star Stormy Daniels in the days before the 2016 election? Did a covert source of money feed his frenzy of acquisition that began in the mid-2000s?

The Times examined and analyzed the data from thousands of individual and business tax returns for 2000 through 2017, along with additional tax information from other years. The trove included years of employee compensation information and records of cash payments between the president and his businesses, as well as information about ongoing federal audits of his taxes. This article also draws upon dozens of interviews and previously unreported material from other sources, both public and confidential.

All of the information The Times obtained was provided by sources with legal access to it. While most of the tax data has not previously been made public, The Times was able to verify portions of it by comparing it with publicly available information and confidential records previously obtained by The Times.

To delve into the records is to see up close the complex structure of the president’s business interests — and the depth of his entanglements. What is popularly known as the Trump Organization is in fact a collection of more than 500 entities, virtually all of them wholly owned by Mr. Trump, many carrying his name. For example, 105 of them are a variation of the name Trump Marks, which he uses for licensing deals.

Fragments of Mr. Trump’s tax returns have leaked out before.

Transcripts of his main federal tax form, the 1040, from 1985 to 1994, were obtained by The Times in 2019. They showed that, in many years, Mr. Trump lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer. Three pages of his 1995 returns, mailed anonymously to The Times during the 2016 campaign, showed that Mr. Trump had declared losses of $915.7 million, giving him a tax deduction that could have allowed him to avoid federal income taxes for almost two decades. Five months later, the journalist David Cay Johnston obtained two pages of Mr. Trump’s returns from 2005; that year, his fortunes had rebounded to the point that he was paying taxes.

In 1995, the year Mr. Trump broke ground on the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York, he would declare losses of $915.7 million — a sum so large, it could be carried forward to cancel out taxable income for years.

The vast new trove of information analyzed by The Times completes the recurring pattern of ascent and decline that has defined the president’s career. Even so, it has its limits.

Tax returns do not, for example, record net worth — in Mr. Trump’s case, a topic of much posturing and almost as much debate. The documents chart a great churn of money, but while returns report debts, they often do not identify lenders.

The data contains no new revelations about the $130,000 payment to Stephanie Clifford, the actress who performs as Stormy Daniels — a focus of the Manhattan district attorney’s subpoena for Mr. Trump’s tax returns and other financial information. Mr. Trump has acknowledged reimbursing his former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, who made the payoff, but the materials obtained by The Times did not include any itemized payments to Mr. Cohen. The amount, however, could have been improperly included in legal fees written off as a business expense, which are not required to be itemized on tax returns.

No subject has provoked more intense speculation about Mr. Trump’s finances than his connection to Russia. While the tax records revealed no previously unknown financial connection — and, for the most part, lack the specificity required to do so — they did shed new light on the money behind the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, a subject of enduring intrigue because of subsequent investigations into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.

The records show that the pageant was the most profitable Miss Universe during Mr. Trump’s time as co-owner, and that it generated a personal payday of $2.3 million — made possible, at least in part, by the Agalarov family, who would later help set up the infamous 2016 meeting between Trump campaign officials seeking “dirt” on Mrs. Clinton and a Russian lawyer connected to the Kremlin.

In August, the Senate Intelligence Committee released a report that looked extensively into the circumstances of the Moscow pageant, and revealed that as recently as February, investigators subpoenaed the Russian singer Emin Agalarov, who was involved in planning it. Mr. Agalarov’s father, Aras, a billionaire who boasts of close ties to Mr. Putin, was Mr. Trump’s partner in the event.

The committee interviewed a top Miss Universe executive, Paula Shugart, who said the Agalarovs offered to underwrite the event; their family business, Crocus Group, paid a $6 million licensing fee and another $6 million in expenses. But while the pageant proved to be a financial loss for the Agalarovs — they recouped only $2 million — Ms. Shugart told investigators that it was “one of the most lucrative deals” the Miss Universe organization ever made, according to the report.

That is borne out by the tax records. They show that in 2013, the pageant reported $31.6 million in gross receipts — the highest since at least the 1990s — allowing Mr. Trump and his co-owner, NBC, to split profits of $4.7 million. By comparison, Mr. Trump and NBC shared losses of $2 million from the pageant the year before the Moscow event, and $3.8 million from the one the year after.

Loser, Winner

Losses reported by businesses Mr. Trump owns and runs helped wipe out tax bills on hundreds of millions of dollars in celebrity income.

While Mr. Trump crisscrossed the country in 2015 describing himself as uniquely qualified to be president because he was “really rich” and had “built a great company,” his accountants back in New York were busy putting the finishing touches on his 2014 tax return.

After tabulating all the profits and losses from Mr. Trump’s various endeavors on Form 1040, the accountants came to Line 56, where they had to enter the total income tax the candidate was required to pay. They needed space for only a single figure.

Zero.

For Mr. Trump, that bottom line must have looked familiar. It was the fourth year in a row that he had not paid a penny of federal income taxes.

Mr. Trump’s avoidance of income taxes is one of the most striking discoveries in his tax returns, especially given the vast wash of income itemized elsewhere in those filings.

Mr. Trump’s net income from his fame — his 50 percent share of “The Apprentice,” together with the riches showered upon him by the scores of suitors paying to use his name — totaled $427.4 million through 2018. A further $176.5 million in profit came to him through his investment in two highly successful office buildings.

So how did he escape nearly all taxes on that fortune? Even the effective tax rate paid by the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans could have caused him to pay more than $100 million.

The answer rests in a third category of Mr. Trump’s endeavors: businesses that he owns and runs himself. The collective and persistent losses he reported from them largely absolved him from paying federal income taxes on the $600 million from “The Apprentice,” branding deals and investments.

That equation is a key element of the alchemy of Mr. Trump’s finances: using the proceeds of his celebrity to purchase and prop up risky businesses, then wielding their losses to avoid taxes.

Throughout his career, Mr. Trump’s business losses have often accumulated in sums larger than could be used to reduce taxes on other income in a single year. But the tax code offers a workaround: With some restrictions, business owners can carry forward leftover losses to reduce taxes in future years.

That provision has been the background music to Mr. Trump’s life. As The Times’s previous reporting on his 1995 return showed, the nearly $1 billion in losses from his early-1990s collapse generated a tax deduction that he could use for up to 18 years going forward.

The newer tax returns show that Mr. Trump burned through the last of the tax-reducing power of that $1 billion in 2005, just as a torrent of entertainment riches began coming his way following the debut of “The Apprentice” the year before.

For 2005 through 2007, cash from licensing deals and endorsements filled Mr. Trump’s bank accounts with $120 million in pure profit. With no prior-year losses left to reduce his taxable income, he paid substantial federal income taxes for the first time in his life: a total of $70.1 million.

As his celebrity income swelled, Mr. Trump went on a buying spree unlike any he had had since the 1980s, when eager banks and his father’s wealth allowed him to buy or build the casinos, airplanes, yacht and old hotel that would soon lay him low.

When “The Apprentice” premiered, Mr. Trump had opened only two golf courses and was renovating two more. By the end of 2015, he had 15 courses and was transforming the Old Post Office building in Washington into a Trump International Hotel. But rather than making him wealthier, the tax records reveal as never before, each new acquisition only fed the downward draft on his bottom line.

Consider the results at his largest golf resort, Trump National Doral, near Miami. Mr. Trump bought the resort for $150 million in 2012; through 2018, his losses have totaled $162.3 million. He has pumped $213 million of fresh cash into Doral, tax records show, and has a $125 million mortgage balance coming due in three years.

His three courses in Europe — two in Scotland and one in Ireland — have reported a combined $63.6 million in losses.

Over all, since 2000, Mr. Trump has reported losses of $315.6 million at the golf courses that are his prized possessions.

For all of its Trumpworld allure, his Washington hotel, opened in 2016, has not fared much better. Its tax records show losses through 2018 of $55.5 million.

And Trump Corporation, a real estate services company, has reported losing $134 million since 2000. Mr. Trump personally bankrolled the losses year after year, marking his cash infusions as a loan with an ever-increasing balance, his tax records show. In 2016, he gave up on getting paid back and turned the loan into a cash contribution.

Mr. Trump has often posited that his losses are more accounting magic than actual money out the door.

Last year, after The Times published details of his tax returns from the 1980s and 1990s, he attributed the red ink to depreciation, which he said in a tweet would show “losses in almost all cases” and that “much was non monetary.”

“I love depreciation,” Mr. Trump said during a presidential debate in 2016.

Depreciation, though, is not a magic wand — it involves real money spent or borrowed to buy buildings or other assets that are expected to last years. Those costs must be spread out as expenses and deducted over the useful life of the asset. Even so, the rules do hold particular advantages for real estate developers like Mr. Trump, who are allowed to use their real estate losses to reduce their taxable income from other activities.

What the tax records for Mr. Trump’s businesses show, however, is that he has lost chunks of his fortune even before depreciation is figured in. The three European golf courses, the Washington hotel, Doral and Trump Corporation reported losing a total of $150.3 million from 2010 through 2018, without including depreciation as an expense.

To see what a successful business looks like, depreciation or not, look no further than one in Mr. Trump’s portfolio that he does not manage.

After plans for a Trump-branded mini-city on the Far West Side of Manhattan stalled in the 1990s, Mr. Trump’s stake was sold by his partner to Vornado Realty Trust. Mr. Trump objected to the sale in court, saying he had not been consulted, but he ended up with a 30 percent share of two valuable office buildings owned and operated by Vornado.

His share of the profits through the end of 2018 totaled $176.5 million, with depreciation factored in. He has never had to invest more money in the partnership, tax records show.

Among businesses he runs, Mr. Trump’s first success remains his best. The retail and commercial spaces at Trump Tower, completed in 1983, have reliably delivered more than $20 million a year in profits, a total of $336.3 million since 2000 that has done much to help keep him afloat.

Mr. Trump has an established track record of stiffing his lenders. But the tax returns reveal that he has failed to pay back far more money than previously known: a total of $287 million since 2010.

The I.R.S. considers forgiven debt to be income, but Mr. Trump was able to avoid taxes on much of that money by reducing his ability to declare future business losses. For the rest, he took advantage of a provision of the Great Recession bailout that allowed income from canceled debt to be completely deferred for five years, then spread out evenly over the next five. He declared the first $28.2 million in 2014.

Once again, his business losses mostly absolved his tax responsibilities. He paid no federal income taxes for 2014.

Mr. Trump was periodically required to pay a parallel income tax called the alternative minimum tax, created as a tripwire to prevent wealthy people from using huge deductions, including business losses, to entirely wipe out their tax liabilities.

Mr. Trump paid alternative minimum tax in seven years between 2000 and 2017 — a total of $24.3 million, excluding refunds he received after filing. For 2015, he paid $641,931, his first payment of any federal income tax since 2010.

As he settled into the Oval Office, his tax bills soon returned to form. His potential taxable income in 2016 and 2017 included $24.8 million in profits from sources related to his celebrity status and $56.4 million for the loans he did not repay. The dreaded alternative minimum tax would let his business losses erase only some of his liability.

Each time, he requested an extension to file his 1040; and each time, he made the required payment to the I.R.S. for income taxes he might owe — $1 million for 2016 and $4.2 million for 2017. But virtually all of that liability was washed away when he eventually filed, and most of the payments were rolled forward to cover potential taxes in future years.

To cancel out the tax bills, Mr. Trump made use of $9.7 million in business investment credits, at least some of which related to his renovation of the Old Post Office hotel, which qualified for a historic-preservation tax break. Although he had more than enough credits to owe no taxes at all, his accountants appear to have carved out an allowance for a small tax liability for both 2016 and 2017.

When they got to line 56, the one for income taxes due, the amount was the same each year: $750.

The $72.9 Million Maneuver

“The Apprentice” created what was probably the biggest income tax bite of Mr. Trump’s life. During the Great Recession bailout, he asked for the money back.

Testifying before Congress in February 2019, the president’s estranged personal lawyer, Mr. Cohen, recalled Mr. Trump’s showing him a huge check from the U.S. Treasury some years earlier and musing “that he could not believe how stupid the government was for giving someone like him that much money back.”

In fact, confidential records show that starting in 2010 he claimed, and received, an income tax refund totaling $72.9 million — all the federal income tax he had paid for 2005 through 2008, plus interest.

The legitimacy of that refund is at the center of the audit battle that he has long been waging, out of public view, with the I.R.S.

The records that The Times reviewed square with the way Mr. Trump has repeatedly cited, without explanation, an ongoing audit as grounds for refusing to release his tax returns. He alluded to it as recently as July on Fox News, when he told Sean Hannity, “They treat me horribly, the I.R.S., horribly.”

And while the records do not lay out all the details of the audit, they match his lawyers’ statement during the 2016 campaign that audits of his returns for 2009 and subsequent years remained open, and involved “transactions or activities that were also reported on returns for 2008 and earlier.”

Mr. Trump harvested that refund bonanza by declaring huge business losses — a total of $1.4 billion from his core businesses for 2008 and 2009 — that tax laws had prevented him from using in prior years.

But to turn that long arc of failure into a giant refund check, he relied on some deft accounting footwork and an unwitting gift from an unlikely source — Mr. Obama.

Business losses can work like a tax-avoidance coupon: A dollar lost on one business reduces a dollar of taxable income from elsewhere. The types and amounts of income that can be used in a given year vary, depending on an owner’s tax status. But some losses can be saved for later use, or even used to request a refund on taxes paid in a prior year.

Until 2009, those coupons could be used to wipe away taxes going back only two years. But that November, the window was more than doubled by a little-noticed provision in a bill Mr. Obama signed as part of the Great Recession recovery effort. Now business owners could request full refunds of taxes paid in the prior four years, and 50 percent of those from the year before that.

Mr. Trump had paid no income taxes in 2008. But the change meant that when he filed his taxes for 2009, he could seek a refund of not just the $13.3 million he had paid in 2007, but also the combined $56.9 million paid in 2005 and 2006, when “The Apprentice” created what was likely the biggest income tax bite of his life.

The records reviewed by The Times indicate that Mr. Trump filed for the first of several tranches of his refund several weeks later, in January 2010. That set off what tax professionals refer to as a “quickie refund,” a check processed in 90 days on a tentative basis, pending an audit by the I.R.S.

His total federal income tax refund would eventually grow to $70.1 million, plus $2,733,184 in interest. He also received $21.2 million in state and local refunds, which often piggyback on federal filings.

Whether Mr. Trump gets to keep the cash, though, remains far from a sure thing.

Refunds require the approval of I.R.S. auditors and an opinion of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, a bipartisan panel better known for reviewing the impact of tax legislation. Tax law requires the committee to weigh in on all refunds larger than $2 million to individuals.

Records show that the results of an audit of Mr. Trump’s refund were sent to the joint committee in the spring of 2011. An agreement was reached in late 2014, the documents indicate, but the audit resumed and grew to include Mr. Trump’s returns for 2010 through 2013. In the spring of 2016, with Mr. Trump closing in on the Republican nomination, the case was sent back to the committee. It has remained there, unresolved, with the statute of limitations repeatedly pushed forward.

Precisely why the case has stalled is not clear. But experts say it suggests that the gap between the sides remains wide. If negotiations were to deadlock, the case would move to federal court, where it could become a matter of public record.

The dispute may center on a single claim that jumps off the page of Mr. Trump’s 2009 tax return: a declaration of more than $700 million in business losses that he had not been allowed to use in prior years. Unleashing that giant tax-avoidance coupon enabled him to receive some or all of his refund.

The material obtained by The Times does not identify the business or businesses that generated those losses. But the losses were a kind that can be claimed only when partners give up their interest in a business. And in 2009, Mr. Trump parted ways with a giant money loser: his long-failing Atlantic City casinos.

After Mr. Trump’s bondholders rebuffed his offer to buy them out, and with a third round of bankruptcy only a week away, Mr. Trump announced in February 2009 that he was quitting the board of directors.

“If I’m not going to run it, I don’t want to be involved in it,” he told The Associated Press. “I’m one of the largest developers in the world. I have a lot of cash and plenty of places I can go.”

The same day, he notified the Securities and Exchange Commission that he had “determined that his partnership interests are worthless and lack potential to regain value” and was “hereby abandoning” his stake.

The language was crucial. Mr. Trump was using the precise wording of I.R.S. rules governing the most beneficial, and perhaps aggressive, method for business owners to avoid taxes when separating from a business.

A partner who walks away from a business with nothing — what tax laws refer to as abandonment — can suddenly declare all the losses on the business that could not be used in prior years. But there are a few catches, including this: Abandonment is essentially an all-or-nothing proposition. If the I.R.S. learns that the owner received anything of value, the allowable losses are reduced to just $3,000 a year.

And Mr. Trump does appear to have received something. When the casino bankruptcy concluded, he got 5 percent of the stock in the new company. The materials reviewed by The Times do not make clear whether Mr. Trump’s refund application reflected his public declaration of abandonment. If it did, that 5 percent could place his entire refund in question.

If the auditors ultimately disallow Mr. Trump’s $72.9 million federal refund, he will be forced to return that money with interest, and possibly penalties, a total that could exceed $100 million. He could also be ordered to return the state and local refunds based on the same claims.

In response to a question about the audit, Mr. Garten, the Trump Organization lawyer, said facts cited by The Times were incorrect, without citing specifics. He did, however, write that it was “illogical” to say Mr. Trump had not paid taxes for those three years just because the money was later refunded.

“While you claim that President Trump paid no taxes in 10 of the 15 previous years,” Mr. Garten said, “you also assert that President Trump claimed a massive refund for tens of millions for taxes he did pay. These two claims are entirely inconsistent and, in any event, not supported by the facts.”

House Democrats who have been in hot pursuit of Mr. Trump’s tax returns most likely have no idea that at least some of the records are sitting in a congressional office building. George Yin, a former chief of staff for the joint committee, said that any identifying information about taxpayers under review was tightly held among a handful of staff lawyers and was rarely shared with politicians assigned to the committee.

It is possible that the case has been paused because Mr. Trump is president, which would raise the personal stakes of re-election. If the recent Fox interview is any indication, Mr. Trump seems increasingly agitated about the matter.

“It’s a disgrace what’s happened,” he told Mr. Hannity. “We had a deal done. In fact, it was — I guess it was signed even. And once I ran, or once I won, or somewhere back a long time ago, everything was like, ‘Well, let’s start all over again.’ It’s a disgrace.”

The 20 Percent Solution

Helping to reduce Mr. Trump’s tax bills are unidentified consultants’ fees, some of which can be matched to payments received by Ivanka Trump.

Examining the Trump Organization’s tax records, a curious pattern emerges: Between 2010 and 2018, Mr. Trump wrote off some $26 million in unexplained “consulting fees” as a business expense across nearly all of his projects.

In most cases the fees were roughly one-fifth of his income: In Azerbaijan, Mr. Trump collected $5 million on a hotel deal and reported $1.1 million in consulting fees, while in Dubai it was $3 million with a $630,000 fee, and so on.

Mysterious big payments in business deals can raise red flags, particularly in places where bribes or kickbacks to middlemen are routine. But there is no evidence that Mr. Trump, who mostly licenses his name to other people’s projects and is not involved in securing government approvals, has engaged in such practices.

Rather, there appears to be a closer-to-home explanation for at least some of the fees: Mr. Trump reduced his taxable income by treating a family member as a consultant, and then deducting the fee as a cost of doing business.

The “consultants” are not identified in the tax records. But evidence of this arrangement was gleaned by comparing the confidential tax records to the financial disclosures Ivanka Trump filed when she joined the White House staff in 2017. Ms. Trump reported receiving payments from a consulting company she co-owned, totaling $747,622, that exactly matched consulting fees claimed as tax deductions by the Trump Organization for hotel projects in Vancouver and Hawaii.

Ms. Trump had been an executive officer of the Trump companies that received profits from and paid the consulting fees for both projects — meaning she appears to have been treated as a consultant on the same hotel deals that she helped manage as part of her job at her father’s business.

When asked about the arrangement, the Trump Organization lawyer, Mr. Garten, did not comment.

Employers can deduct consulting fees as a business expense and also avoid the withholding taxes that apply to wages. To claim the deduction, the consulting arrangement must be an “ordinary and necessary” part of running the business, with fees that are reasonable and market-based, according to the I.R.S. The recipient of the fees is still required to pay income tax.

The I.R.S. has pursued civil penalties against some business owners who devised schemes to avoid taxes by paying exorbitant fees to related parties who were not in fact independent contractors. A 2011 tax court case centered on the I.R.S.’s denial of almost $3 million in deductions for consulting fees the partners in an Illinois accounting firm paid themselves via corporations they created. The court concluded that the partners had structured the fees to “distribute profits, not to compensate for services.”

There is no indication that the I.R.S. has questioned Mr. Trump’s practice of deducting millions of dollars in consulting fees. If the payments to his daughter were compensation for work, it is not clear why Mr. Trump would do it in this form, other than to reduce his own tax liability. Another, more legally perilous possibility is that the fees were a way to transfer assets to his children without incurring a gift tax.

A Times investigation in 2018 found that Mr. Trump’s late father, Fred Trump, employed a number of legally dubious schemes decades ago to evade gift taxes on millions of dollars he transferred to his children. It is not possible to discern from this newer collection of tax records whether intra-family financial maneuverings were a motivating factor.

However, the fact that some of the consulting fees are identical to those reported by Mr. Trump’s daughter raises the question of whether this was a mechanism the president used to compensate his adult children involved with his business. Indeed, in some instances where large fees were claimed, people with direct knowledge of the projects were not aware of any outside consultants who would have been paid.

On the failed hotel deal in Azerbaijan, which was plagued by suspicions of corruption, a Trump Organization lawyer told The New Yorker the company was blameless because it was merely a licenser and had no substantive role, adding, “We did not pay any money to anyone.” Yet, the tax records for three Trump L.L.C.s involved in that project show deductions for consulting fees totaling $1.1 million that were paid to someone.

In Turkey, a person directly involved in developing two Trump towers in Istanbul expressed bafflement when asked about consultants on the project, telling The Times there was never any consultant or other third party in Turkey paid by the Trump Organization. But tax records show regular deductions for consulting fees over seven years totaling $2 million.

Ms. Trump disclosed in her public filing that the fees she received were paid through TTT Consulting L.L.C., which she said provided “consulting, licensing and management services for real estate projects.” Incorporated in Delaware in December 2005, the firm is one of several Trump-related entities with some variation of TTT or TTTT in the name that appear to refer to members of the Trump family.

Like her brothers Donald Jr. and Eric, Ms. Trump was a longtime employee of the Trump Organization and an executive officer for more than 200 Trump companies that licensed or managed hotel and resort properties. The tax records show that the three siblings had each drawn a salary from their father’s company — roughly $480,000 a year, jumping to about $2 million after Mr. Trump became president — though Ms. Trump no longer receives a salary. What’s more, Mr. Trump has said the children were intimately involved in negotiating and managing his projects. When asked in a 2011 lawsuit deposition whom he relied on to handle important details of his licensing deals, he named only Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric.

On Ms. Trump’s now-defunct website, which explains her role at the Trump Organization, she was not identified as a consultant. Rather, she has been described as a senior executive who “actively participates in all aspects of both Trump and Trump branded projects, including deal evaluation, predevelopment planning, financing, design, construction, sales and marketing, and ensuring that Trump’s world-renowned physical and operational standards are met.

“She is involved in all decisions — large and small.”

The Art of the Write-Off

Hair stylists, table linens, property taxes on a family estate — all have been deducted as business expenses.

Private jets, country clubs and mansions have all had a role in the selling of Donald Trump.

“I play to people’s fantasies,” he wrote in “Trump: The Art of the Deal.” “People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular. I call it truthful hyperbole. It’s an innocent form of exaggeration — and a very effective form of promotion.”

If the singular Trump product is Trump in an exaggerated form — the man, the lifestyle, the acquisitiveness — then everything that feeds the image, including the cost of his businesses, can be written off on his taxes. Mr. Trump may be reporting business losses to the government, but he can still live a life of wealth and write it off.

Take, for example, Mar-a-Lago, now the president’s permanent residence as well as a private club and stage set on which Trump luxury plays out. As a business, it is also the source of millions of dollars in expenses deducted from taxable income, among them $109,433 for linens and silver and $197,829 for landscaping in 2017. Also deducted as a business expense was the $210,000 paid to a Florida photographer over the years for shooting numerous events at the club, including a 2016 New Year’s Eve party hosted by Mr. Trump.

Mar-a-Lago, where a flood of new members starting in 2015 allowed Mr. Trump to pocket an additional $5 million a year from the business, is also a source of millions in tax deductions. Saul Martinez for The New York Times

Mr. Trump has written off as business expenses costs — including fuel and meals — associated with his aircraft, used to shuttle him among his various homes and properties. Likewise the cost of haircuts, including the more than $70,000 paid to style his hair during “The Apprentice.” Together, nine Trump entities have written off at least $95,464 paid to a favorite hair and makeup artist of Ivanka Trump.

In allowing business expenses to be deducted, the I.R.S. requires that they be “ordinary and necessary,” a loosely defined standard often interpreted generously by business owners.

Perhaps Mr. Trump’s most generous interpretation of the business expense write-off is his treatment of the Seven Springs estate in Westchester County, N.Y.

Seven Springs is a throwback to another era. The main house, built in 1919 by Eugene I. Meyer Jr., the onetime head of the Federal Reserve who bought The Washington Post in 1933, sits on more than 200 acres of lush, almost untouched land just an hour’s drive north of New York City.

“The mansion is 50,000 square feet, has three pools, carriage houses, and is surrounded by nature preserves,” according to The Trump Organization website.

Mr. Trump had big plans when he bought the property in 1996 — a golf course, a clubhouse and 15 private homes. But residents of surrounding towns thwarted his ambitions, arguing that development would draw too much traffic and risk polluting the drinking water.

Mr. Trump instead found a way to reap tax benefits from the estate. He took advantage of what is known as a conservation easement. In 2015, he signed a deal with a land conservancy, agreeing not to develop most of the property. In exchange, he claimed a $21.1 million charitable tax deduction.

Mr. Trump classified the Seven Springs estate as an investment property, not a personal residence, allowing for certain tax savings. Meanwhile, Eric Trump has called it a “home base,” and the Trump Organization website describes it as a “retreat for the Trump family.” Tony Cenicola/The New York Times

The tax records reveal another way Seven Springs has generated substantial tax savings. In 2014, Mr. Trump classified the estate as an investment property, as distinct from a personal residence. Since then, he has written off $2.2 million in property taxes as a business expense — even as his 2017 tax law allowed individuals to write off only $10,000 in property taxes a year.

Courts have held that to treat residences as businesses for tax purposes, owners must show that they have “an actual and honest objective of making a profit,” typically by making substantial efforts to rent the property and eventually generating income.

Whether or not Seven Springs fits those criteria, the Trumps have described the property somewhat differently.

In 2014, Eric Trump told Forbes that “this is really our compound.” Growing up, he and his brother Donald Jr. spent many summers there, riding all-terrain vehicles and fishing on a nearby lake. At one point, the brothers took up residence in a carriage house on the property. “It was home base for us for a long, long time,” Eric told Forbes.

And the Trump Organization website still describes Seven Springs as a “retreat for the Trump family.”

Mr. Garten, the Trump Organization lawyer, did not respond to a question about the Seven Springs write-off.

The Seven Springs conservation-easement deduction is one of four that Mr. Trump has claimed over the years. While his use of these deductions is widely known, his tax records show that they represent the lion’s share of his charitable giving — about $119.3 million of roughly $130 million in personal and corporate charitable contributions reported to the I.R.S.

Two of those deductions — at Seven Springs and at the Trump National Golf Club in Los Angeles — are the focus of an investigation by the New York attorney general, who is examining whether the appraisals on the land, and therefore the tax deductions, were inflated.

Another common deductible expense for all businesses is legal fees. The I.R.S. requires that these fees be “directly related to operating your business,” and businesses cannot deduct “legal fees paid to defend charges that arise from participation in a political campaign.”

Yet the tax records show that the Trump Corporation wrote off as business expenses fees paid to a criminal defense lawyer, Alan S. Futerfas, who was hired to represent Donald Trump Jr. during the Russia inquiry. Investigators were examining Donald Jr.’s role in the 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians who had promised damaging information on Mrs. Clinton. When he testified before Congress in 2017, Mr. Futerfas was by his side.

Mr. Futerfas was also hired to defend the president’s embattled charitable foundation, which would be shut down in 2018 after New York regulators said it had engaged in “a shocking pattern of illegality.”

The Trump Corporation paid Mr. Futerfas at least $1.9 million in 2017 and 2018, tax records show. Also written off was at least $259,684 paid to Williams & Jensen, another law firm brought in during the same period to represent Donald Trump Jr.

A President and a Businessman

Deals in countries led by strongmen, tenants who have business before the federal government, and hotels and clubs that draw those seeking access or favor.

In May, the chairman of a trade group representing Turkish business interests wrote to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross urging support for increased trade between the United States and Turkey. The ultimate goal was nothing less than “reorienting the U.S. supply chain away from China.”

The letter was among three sent to cabinet secretaries by Mehmet Ali Yalcindag, chairman of the Turkey-U.S. Business Council, who noted that he had copied each one to Mr. Trump.

The president needed no introduction to Mr. Yalcindag: The Turkish businessman helped negotiate a licensing deal in 2008 for his family’s company to develop two Trump towers in Istanbul. The tax records show the deal has earned Mr. Trump at least $13 million — far more than previously known — including more than $1 million since he entered the White House, even as his onetime associate now lobbies on behalf of Turkish interests.

Mr. Yalcindag said he had “remained friendly” with Mr. Trump since their work together years ago, but that all communications between his trade group and the administration “go through formal channels and are properly disclosed.”

The ethical quandaries created by Mr. Trump’s decision to keep his business while in the White House have been documented. But the full financial measure of his extraordinary confluence of interests — a president with a wealth of business entanglements at home and in myriad geopolitical hot spots — has remained elusive.

The tax records for Mr. Trump and his hundreds of companies show precisely how much money he has received over the years, and how heavily he has come to rely on leveraging his brand in ways that pose potential or direct conflicts of interest while he is president. The records also provide the first reliable window onto his finances before 2014, the earliest year covered by his required annual disclosures, showing that his total profits from some projects outside the United States were larger than indicated by those limited public filings.

Based on the financial disclosures, which report much of his income in broad ranges, Mr. Trump’s earnings from the Istanbul towers could have been as low as $3.2 million. In the Philippines, where he licensed his name to a Manila tower nearly a decade ago, the low end of the range was $4.1 million — less than half of the $9.3 million he actually made. In Azerbaijan, he collected more than $5 million for the failed hotel project, about twice what appeared on his public filings.

It did not take long for conflicts to emerge when Mr. Trump ran for president and won. The Philippines’ strongman leader, Rodrigo Duterte, chose as a special trade envoy to Washington the businessman behind the Trump tower in Manila. In Argentina, a key person who had been involved in a Uruguayan licensing deal that earned Mr. Trump $2.3 million was appointed to a cabinet post.

The president’s conflicts have been most evident with Turkey, where the business community and the authoritarian government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan have not hesitated to leverage various Trump enterprises to their advantage. When Turkish-American relations were at a low point, a Turkish business group canceled a conference at Mr. Trump’s Washington hotel; six months later, when the two countries were on better terms, the rescheduled event was attended by Turkish government officials. Turkish Airlines also chose the Trump National Golf Club in suburban Virginia to host an event.

More broadly, the tax records suggest other ways in which Mr. Trump’s presidency has propped up his sagging bottom line. Monthly credit card receipts, reported to the I.R.S. by third-party card processing firms, reflect the way certain of his resorts, golf courses and hotels became favored stomping grounds, if not venues for influence-trading, beginning in 2015 and continuing into his time in the White House.

The credit card data does not reflect total revenue, and is useful mainly for showing short-term ups and downs of consumer interest in a business. While two of Mr. Trump’s marquee draws — the Washington hotel in the Old Post Office and the Doral golf resort — are loaded with debt and continue to lose money, both have seen credit card transactions rise markedly with his political ascent.

At the hotel, the monthly receipts grew from $3.7 million in December 2016 shortly after it opened, to $5.4 million in January 2017 and $6 million by May 2018. At Doral, after Mr. Trump declared his candidacy in June 2015, credit card revenue more than doubled, to $13 million, for the three months through August, compared with the same period the year before.

One Trump enterprise that has been regularly profitable, and is a persistent source of concern about ethical conflicts and national security lapses, is the Mar-a-Lago club. Profits there rose sharply after Mr. Trump declared his candidacy, as courtiers eagerly joining up brought a tenfold rise in cash from initiation fees — from $664,000 in 2014 to just under $6 million in 2016, even before Mr. Trump doubled the cost of initiation in January 2017. The membership rush allowed the president to take $26 million out of the business from 2015 through 2018, nearly triple the rate at which he had paid himself in the prior two years.

Some of the largest payments from business groups for events or conferences at Mar-a-Lago and other Trump properties have come since Mr. Trump became president, the tax records show.

At Doral, Mr. Trump collected a total of at least $7 million in 2015 and 2016 from Bank of America, and at least $1.2 million in 2017 and 2018 from a trade association representing food retailers and wholesalers. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce paid Doral at least $406,599 in 2018.

Beyond one-time payments for events or memberships, large corporations also pay rent for space in the few commercial buildings Mr. Trump actually owns. Walgreens, the pharmacy giant that resolved an antitrust matter before federal regulators in 2017, pays $3.4 million a year for a lease at 40 Wall Street, a Trump-owned office building in Manhattan.

Another renter at 40 Wall, for $2.5 million a year, is Atane Engineers, which changed its name in 2018 after a corruption scandal that culminated in two former top executives’ pleading guilty to paying bribes for city infrastructure contracts. Despite the criminal case — which landed the company on New York State’s list of “non-responsible entities” that require a waiver to obtain state contracts — the newly christened Atane registered as an eligible federal contractor with no restrictions listed in its file.

Rental income over all at 40 Wall has risen markedly, from $30.5 million in 2014 to $43.2 million in 2018. The tax records show that the cost of existing leases there has risen, and at least four law firms appear to have moved in since Mr. Trump ran for president.

Mr. Trump has a 30 percent stake in two valuable office towers, including one in Midtown Manhattan, shared with and managed by Vornado Realty Trust. Dave Sanders for The New York Times The other tower, in San Francisco, co-owned with Vornado, whose C.E.O. is a Trump ally and whose tenants include firms that lobby the federal government. Jim Wilson/The New York Times

In addition to buildings he owns outright, there is the president’s stake in the Vornado partnerships that control two valuable office towers — 1290 Sixth Avenue in Manhattan and 555 California Street in San Francisco. Vornado’s chief executive, Steven Roth, is a close Trump ally recently named to the White House economic recovery council. Last year, the president appointed Mr. Roth’s wife, Daryl Roth, to the Kennedy Center board of trustees.

Vornado tenants include a roster of blue-chip firms paying multimillion-dollar leases, many of whom regularly do business with, lobby or are regulated by the federal government. Among the dozens of leases paid in 2018 to Mr. Trump’s Vornado partnerships, according to his tax records, were $5.8 million from Goldman Sachs; $3.1 million from Microsoft; $32.7 million from Neuberger Berman, an investment management company; and $8.8 million from the law firm Kirkland & Ellis.

The Gathering Storm

Threats are converging: mounting business losses, the looming I.R.S. audit and personally guaranteed debts coming due.

When Mr. Trump glided down a gilded Trump Tower escalator to kick off his presidential campaign in June 2015, his finances needed a jolt.

His core businesses were reporting mounting losses — more than $100 million over the previous two years. The river of celebrity-driven income that had long buoyed them was running dry.

If Mr. Trump hoped his unlikely candidacy might, at least, revitalize his brand, his barrage of derogatory remarks about immigrants quickly cost him two of his biggest and easiest sources of cash — licensing deals with clothing and mattress manufacturers that had netted him more than $30 million. NBC, his partner in Miss Universe — source of nearly $20 million in profits — announced that it would no longer broadcast the pageant; he sold it soon after.

Now his tax records make clear that he is facing a battery of threats to his business and his own financial well-being.

Over the past decade, he appears to have filled the cash-flow gaps with a series of one-shots that may not be available again.

In 2012, he took out a $100 million mortgage on the commercial space in Trump Tower. He took nearly the entire amount as a payout, his tax records show. His company has paid more than $15 million in interest on the loan, but nothing on the principal. The full $100 million comes due in 2022.

In 2013, he withdrew $95.8 million from his Vornado partnership account.

And in January 2014, he sold $98 million in stocks and bonds, his biggest single month of sales in at least the last two decades. He sold $54 million more in stocks and bonds in 2015, and $68.2 million in 2016. His financial disclosure released in July showed that he had as little as $873,000 in securities left to sell.

Mr. Trump’s businesses reported cash on hand of $34.7 million in 2018, down 40 percent from five years earlier.

What’s more, the tax records show that Mr. Trump has once again done what he says he regrets, looking back on his early 1990s meltdown: personally guaranteed hundreds of millions of dollars in loans, a decision that led his lenders to threaten to force him into personal bankruptcy.

This time around, he is personally responsible for loans and other debts totaling $421 million, with most of it coming due within four years. Should he win re-election, his lenders could be placed in the unprecedented position of weighing whether to foreclose on a sitting president.

There is, however, a tax benefit for Mr. Trump. While business owners can use losses to avoid taxes, they can do so only up to the amount invested in the business. But by taking personal responsibility for that $421 million in debt, Mr. Trump would be able to declare that amount in losses in future years.

The balances on those loans had not been paid down by the end of 2018. And the businesses carrying the bulk of the debt — the Doral golf resort ($125 million) and the Washington hotel ($160 million) — are struggling, which could make it difficult to find a lender willing to refinance it.

The unresolved audit of his $72.9 million tax refund hangs over his head.

The broader economy promises little relief. Across the country, brick-and-mortar stores are in decline, and they have been very important to Trump Tower, which has in turn been very important to Mr. Trump. Nike, which rented the space for its flagship store in a building attached to Trump Tower and had paid $195.1 million in rent since the 1990s, left in 2018.

The president’s most recent financial disclosure reported modest gains in 2019. But that was before the pandemic hit. His already struggling properties were shut down for several months earlier this year. The Doral resort asked Deutsche Bank to allow a delay on its loan payments. Analysts have predicted that the hotel business will not fully recover until late 2023.

Mr. Trump still has assets to sell. But doing so could take its own toll, both financial and to Mr. Trump’s desire to always be seen as a winner. The Trump family said last year that it was considering selling the Washington hotel, but not because it was losing money.

In Mr. Trump’s telling, any difficulty in his finances has been caused by the sacrifices made for his current job.

“They say, ‘Trump is getting rich off our nation,’” he said at a rally in Minneapolis last October. “I lose billions being president, and I don’t care. It’s nice to be rich, I guess, but I lose billions.”

Rand Paul, R-Ky., is set to speak at the Republican National Convention this week in support of President Trump's 2020 presidential candidacy. Here's what you need to know about the ophthalmologist turned federal lawmaker.

The Kentucky Republican is the son of famed GOP Texas lawmaker Rep. Ron Paul, also known as ""Dr. No"" for his libertarian tendencies and habit of voting against most congressional legislation.

After starting his own medical clinic and practicing as a physician for over 15 years, Paul ran for an open Senate seat during the 2010 midterm elections and defeated state Attorney General Jack Conway. The win was driven by Tea Party enthusiasm and a promise to return to grassroots governing.

Paul won reelection to the Senate in 2016 with Trump leading the top of the ticket, as the upper chamber remained under GOP control.

His political positions vary from conservative to libertarian with a special focus on eliminating government spending, limiting foreign military action, and rooting out privacy abuse by U.S. intelligence agencies and FISA courts against American citizens.

TRUMP ACCUSES DEMOCRATS OF 'USING COVID TO STEAL OUR ELECTION' IN DEFIANT RNC REMARKS AFTER NOMINATION

Paul, who was a presidential candidate in 2016, has long been an advocate of curbing online intelligence abuses such as the collection of data on millions of people by the NSA.

The Republican has spoken out against mandatory minimum prison sentences for nonviolent drug offenders and introduced a bill in June to end the police practice of serving no-knock warrants.

Paul has railed against socialized medicine, citing personal experience as a doctor, while publicly pushing for congressional term limits, along with the federal legalization of medical cannabis.

With regard to Joe Biden, Paul accused the former vice president of being ""up to his eyeballs"" in terms of his alleged involvement with the investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.

gtdtcu	libertarian	"""You're gonna kill me!"" shouted a white man before being suffocated by police officer's knee (2019 article)"	"Tony Timpa wailed and pleaded for help more than 30 times as Dallas police officers pinned his shoulders, knees and neck to the ground.

“You’re gonna kill me! You’re gonna kill me! You’re gonna kill me!”

After Timpa fell unconscious, the officers who had him in handcuffs assumed he was asleep and didn’t confirm that he was breathing or feel for a pulse.

As precious minutes passed, the officers laughed and joked about waking Timpa up for school and making him waffles for breakfast.

Body camera footage obtained Tuesday by The Dallas Morning News shows first responders waited at least four minutes after Timpa became unresponsive to begin CPR. His nose was buried in the grass while officers claimed to hear him snoring -- apparently unaware that the unarmed man was drawing his last breaths.

The officers pinned his handcuffed arms behind his back for nearly 14 minutes and zip-tied his legs together. By the time he was loaded onto a gurney and put into an ambulance, the 32-year-old was dead.

The News obtained Dallas Police Department body camera footage after a three-year fight for records related to Timpa's death. A federal judge ruled Monday in favor of a motion by The News and NBC5 to release records from his death, saying ""the public has a compelling interest in understanding what truly took place during a fatal exchange between a citizen and law enforcement.""

Timpa called 911 on Aug. 10, 2016, from the parking lot of a Dallas porn store, saying he was afraid and needed help. He told a dispatcher he suffered from schizophrenia and depression and was off his prescription medication. The News first reported Timpa's death in a 2017 investigation that showed Dallas police refused to say how a man who had called 911 for help ended up dead.

The newly obtained video and records, part of a lawsuit filed by Timpa’s family in federal court alleging excessive force, contradict key claims Dallas police have made in defending the officers’ actions.

Police incident reports recounting the officers’ version of events claim Timpa’s behavior that night was aggressive and combative. The video shows Timpa writhing at times and clearly struggling to breathe, asking the officers to stop pinning him down.

On a custodial death report submitted to the state in 2016, the department answered ""no"" to questions about whether Timpa resisted arrest, threatened or fought officers.

Police had previously claimed to use only enough force necessary to block Timpa from rolling into a busy section of Mockingbird Lane. In the first minute, Timpa rolls around near the curb. But the video shows a police car clearly blocks traffic about a minute later near the bus bench where the officers had pinned him. Several officers continue pressing his restrained body into the ground.

He had already been handcuffed by a private security guard before police arrived. He never threatens to hurt or kill the police.

The footage also shows the officers mocking Timpa as he struggled to live. Shortly after one officer ridicules Timpa’s repeated cries for help, an officer notes that he appears to be “out cold.”

They joke that he’s merely asleep and try to wake him: “It’s time for school. Wake up!”

One officer mimics a teen saying: “I don’t want to go to school! Five more minutes, Mom!”

They joke about buying him new shoes for the first day of school and making him a special breakfast, laughing loudly.

1 / 4 2 / 4 3 / 4 4 / 4

It’s unclear from the video why Dallas Fire-Rescue medical responders don’t intervene immediately after Timpa loses consciousness.

“I was unable to assess the patient due to his combativeness,” said one of the first responders in a newly obtained affidavit.

However, the medical responders appear to take Timpa’s blood pressure while he is still conscious, about five minutes before administering Versed, a powerful sedative. By the time the paramedic gives Timpa the sedative, officers already are questioning if Timpa is awake.

A Dallas Fire-Rescue spokesman declined to comment on the paramedics’ actions, citing the family’s pending lawsuit in federal court. The Dallas Police Department also declined to comment.

Timpa died within 20 minutes of police arriving, and at least 15 minutes before an ambulance eventually transported his body to Parkland hospital.

As the officers and paramedics struggle to load Timpa’s lifeless body onto the gurney, they begin to panic, seeing his glassy, open eyes and blades of grass stuck to his mouth.

Tony Timpa died in August 2016 at age 32. His family has fought since then to find answers in his death.

One of the officers asks: “He didn’t just die down there, did he?”

An autopsy ruled Timpa's cause of death was a homicide, sudden cardiac death due to ""the toxic effects of cocaine and the stress associated with physical restraint.""

The city of Dallas and Dallas County officials had fought since September 2016 to prevent public release of the records, arguing it could interfere with an ongoing criminal investigation. Officials then said the records could not be released because a criminal case against three of the police officers never made it to trial.

Those three officers -- Kevin Mansell, Danny Vasquez and Dustin Dillard -- were indicted by a grand jury in 2017 on charges of misdemeanor deadly conduct, three months after The News published its investigation into Timpa's death. Following two days of testimony, the grand jury's indictment stated that the ""officers engaged in reckless conduct that placed Timpa in imminent danger of serious bodily injury.""

But in March, Dallas County District Attorney John Creuzot dismissed the charges.

Creuzot previously told The News that he met with ""all three medical examiners"" who had testified to the grand jury. They reportedly told him they did not believe the officers acted recklessly and ""cannot, and will not, testify to the elements of the indictment beyond a reasonable doubt.""

Records recently obtained by The News show the Dallas Police Department's internal affairs investigation related to Timpa's death was completed months before the officers were indicted. Dillard, Mansell and Vasquez were disciplined for ""conduct discrediting"" the department, but those allegations were dropped when the criminal charges were dismissed. Vasquez and another officer present at Timpa's death also received written reprimands for ""discourtesy"" and ""unprofessionalism.""

According to internal affairs records, Mansell and Vasquez were placed on administrative leave in December 2017. Dillard was also placed on leave in March 2018, internal affairs records show.

The officers returned to active duty in April after Creuzot dropped the criminal case against them.

In the video, Dillard pins Timpa to the ground with his knee in his back for more than 13 minutes. Keeping someone face-down and bound at the arms and legs is known as the ""prone position,"" a method of restraint that is controversial in policing. Several studies have shown it may increase the risk for asphyxiation and sudden death.

Officers should know the dangers of restraining someone in a prone position, said Erik Heipt, a Seattle lawyer who specializes in cases of in-custody deaths.

“It’s just basic science: People can be essentially suffocated to death when they're lying on their stomachs in a prone position and there’s weight on their backs compressing their chest and diaphragm,” Heipt said.

“As soon as [police] have someone handcuffed, they’ve got to know to turn them on their sides and be on the lookout for any compromised breathing issues.”

For a person who is restrained and gasping for air, the instinct often is to panic and struggle. Officers may interpret this as resisting and apply more pressure to the person’s back.

“It’s a lethal cycle that happens,” Heipt said.

1 / 3 2 / 3 3 / 3

When officers first arrived at the scene, they told Timpa he would be OK. “We’re gonna get you some help, man,” one of the officers tells him.

But within 15 minutes, Timpa’s not breathing and Dillard can be heard saying: “I hope I didn’t kill him.”

Moments later, after the emergency medical technicians tell police he is dead, Dillard climbs out of the ambulance that holds Timpa’s lifeless body.

Dillard turns to someone before shutting off his body camera and says, “Sorry. We tried.”

Show Caption Hide Caption Protests erupt after Black man fatally shot by police in Philadelphia Police said the victim, Walter Wallace Jr., ""advanced towards"" officers with a knife, but it's not clear in bystander video. USA TODAY, Storyful

Another U.S. city is reporting early success with a program that replaces traditional law enforcement responders with health care workers for some emergency calls.

Previously, Denver 911 operators only directed calls to police or fire department first responders. But the Support Team Assistance Response (STAR) pilot program created a third track for directing emergency calls to a two-person team: a medic and a clinician, staffed in a van from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays.

The STAR program, which launched in June, reported promising results in its six-month progress report. The program aims to provide a ""person-centric mobile crisis response"" to community members who are experiencing problems related to mental health, depression, poverty, homelessness, or substance abuse issues.

Denver is among several U.S. cities working to develop an alternative emergency responder model for people who are experiencing mental health crises, as police officers fatally shoot hundreds of people experiencing mental health crises every year, according to a Washington Post database of fatal shootings by on-duty police officers. Since 2015, police have fatally shot nearly 1,400 people with mental illnesses, according to the database.

Over the first six months of the pilot, Denver received more than 2,500 emergency calls that fell into the STAR program's purview, and the STAR team was able to respond to 748 calls. No calls required the assistance of police, and no one was arrested.

Denver police responded to nearly 95,000 incidents over the same period, suggesting that an expanded STAR program could reduce police calls by nearly 3%, according to the report.

""Overall, the first six months has kind of been a proof of concept of what we wanted,"" said Vinnie Cervantes, a member of Denver Alliance for Street Health Response, one of the organizations involved with the STAR program. ""We've continued to try to work to make it something that is truly a community-city partnership.""

Data collected during the pilot program found that STAR calls were focused in certain areas of the city, and most were calls for trespassing and welfare checks. Approximately 68% of people contacted were experiencing homelessness, and there were mental health concerns in 61% of cases – largely schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder – with 33% of people having co-occurring conditions, according to the report.

Carleigh Sailon, a social worker with the Mental Health Center of Denver who works out of the STAR van, said she takes a ""non-judgmental, client-centered, supportive"" approach to assisting people in crisis.

""The intent of STAR is to send the right response, not a one-size fit all response. People call 911 for an array of reasons and it’s not always something that involves risk or a criminal element,"" Sailon said in a statement. ""If the STAR van can handle someone in crisis and that frees up police to handle a robbery or domestic violence call, then that’s an incredible success.""

The report comes on the heels of a year that saw thousands of protests nationwide in response to the killings of several Black men and women, as well as a series of high-profile police killings of people experiencing mental health crises, including Daniel Prude in Rochester, New York, and Walter Wallace, Jr. in Philadelphia. Many protesters called on their local governments to redirect funding away from police departments.

In recent years, some police departments, such as in Los Angeles and San Antonio, have partnered with mental health professionals to work as ""co-responders,"" assisting street cops responding to incidents involving a mental health crisis. In the wake of Breonna Taylor's killing in Louisville last year, the city increased its police budget and put money toward exploring co-responder models. And Chicago is expected to begin piloting a co-responder program this year.

But other cities rely on emergency response models that do not involve police. The Denver program is modeled after the Crisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets (CAHOOTS) in Eugene, Oregon. White Bird Clinic, a health care center in the city, launched the program as a community policing initiative in 1989.

Like the Denver program, CAHOOTS responds to a range of mental health-related crises and relies on techniques that are focused on harm reduction. With a budget of about $2.1 million annually, CAHOOTS answered 17% of the Eugene Police Department's overall call volume in 2017, according to the program.

In 2019, Cervantes traveled with a group from Denver to Eugene to study the CAHOOTS model. Cervantes said his organization, the Denver Alliance for Street Health Response, is working with about ten other cities in Colorado to draft co-responder models. Aurora – where 23-year-old Elijah McClain died after officers stopped him on the street in 2019 – is expected to launch its pilot in about a month, Cervantes said.

Jan. 15: Family of man fatally shot by Texas officer responding to mental health call want arrest

On the East Coast, New York City announced plans in November to launch a similar pilot program in two neighborhoods.

For the coming year, Denver has allocated $1.4 million in the city's budget to continue the STAR program, according to the report. The funding would be enough to purchase four additional vans and fund six new two-person teams, as well as a full-time supervisor, the report said. The program is also transitioning from the city's safety department to its public health department.

Cervantes said that, as the program goes forward, he hopes to see more complete data on who the program is serving. Current data does not list race or ethnicity for a third of people served by the program, Cervantes said.

""That's something that surprises me,"" Cervantes said. ""How do we really understand the impact of the most marginalized communities in Denver if we don’t have the data there?""

Cervantes said the STAR program set out to connect residents in crisis with social services in the city, as well as identify the gaps in many of the services. When the coronavirus pandemic shut down many of the existing services, it made STAR's task more difficult.

""With COVID, some of the services that would typically be available weren’t quite in full service. That’s something the STAR program had to adapt to,"" he said.

The STAR program is organized through a coalition of city agencies and organizations, including the Denver Police Department, Denver Health Paramedic Division, Denver 911, the Caring for Denver Foundation, the Mental Health Center of Denver and community supporters.

The sweeping legislation includes language to remove marijuana from the federal list of controlled substances and would expunge certain marijuana convictions.

ADVERTISEMENT

Gaetz in a floor speech said that while he doesn’t think the bill is perfect, it is a step in the right direction in bringing down unjust incarcerations and potentially advance innovation in the health care industry in the United States.

“The MORE Act is flawed; it uses cannabis policy to do a great deal of social engineering to create new taxes and new programs and redistribution of assets. But I am here as the only Republican co-sponsor of the MORE Act, and I'm voting for it because the federal government has lied to the people of this country about marijuana for a generation,” he said.

“We have seen a generation, particularly of black and brown youth, locked up for offenses that should not have resulted in any incarceration whatsoever. I'm also deeply troubled that the current policy the federal government inhibits research into cannabis, research that could unlock cures and help people live better lives. My Republican colleagues today will make a number of arguments against this bill, but those arguments are overwhelmingly losing with the American people,"" he continued.

Riggleman also noted some differences over language in the bill, but said there are inconsistencies with marijuana policy that needed to be addressed.

“The MORE Act is not perfect, but it does address problems related to federal marijuana policy,"" he said. “Federal marijuana policy is filled with issues and inconsistencies. I don't know why we can't draft a simple one-page bill that de-schedules marijuana and delegates this authority to the states.""

ADVERTISEMENT

Riggleman said that his brother was incarcerated for a marijuana charge, something that has shaped his stance. He said his family owns and runs a distillery, but that he will ""humbly submit that alcohol can be much worse than marijuana.""



""I don't think there are a lot of Republicans that have a sibling that's been incarcerated for marijuana. It was actually a felony for him. And he has such a difficult time after that, trying to get away from a felony conviction,"" he told The Hill.

""And it's just I think we're at a point where we have to be honest about marijuana, decriminalize it, but also allow the states to have control over how they react to and how they control marijuana.""

Recreational cannabis is legal in 15 states and Washington, D.C., with 34 states having legalized medical marijuana.

The bill marked the first time either chamber has passed legislation to decriminalize cannabis on the federal level."	right
h112c5	libertarian	Don’t Forget Breonna Taylor: Her Death Shows Why ‘No-Knock’ Warrants Need to Go	"Amid the nationwide focus on the death of George Floyd, another tragedy has unfortunately fallen by the wayside. We should not forget the death of Breonna Taylor—or the dire need to abolish the “no-knock” warrants that caused her death, trample property rights, and routinely endanger Americans.

Here’s the sad story of Taylor’s death.

On March 13, police officers broke into the Louisville, Kentucky home of Taylor and her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, unannounced. The police were executing a “no-knock” warrant, which allows them to conduct a search without identifying themselves as law enforcement, as part of a drug crime investigation into a different suspect—not Taylor or Walker—who was already in police custody.

When Walker heard unknown intruders breaking into his home, he did not know they were police officers. So, quite understandably, Walker grabbed his lawfully-owned firearm and fired a shot at the unknown invaders. The ensuing hail of more than 20 police-fired bullets left Taylor dead, and Walker was arrested for attempted murder of a police officer. (The charge has since been dropped).

Police claim that they knocked at the apartment door and announced themselves, yet that is hard to believe. They were specifically executing a “no-knock” warrant, after all, and not just Walker, but multiple neighbors have confirmed they heard no such announcement.

Neither Taylor nor Walker had a criminal history, and no drugs were found in the raid on their apartment.

Taylor’s killing was a grotesque act of police recklessness. It once again exposes the injustice of “no-knock” warrants, which put both police officers and law-abiding Americans in grave and unnecessary danger by creating a situation where a routine law enforcement search can easily turn into a deadly misunderstanding.

And, sadly, Taylor’s death is not as unique as one might think.

Law enforcement officers conduct 20,000 “no-knock” raids a year. We don’t know exactly how many people are killed or injured as a result, but an analysis from the American Civil Liberties Union does provide some insight. As reported by Vox, the ACLU looked into 818 such “no-knock” raids, and found seven deaths (2 were suicides to evade arrest) and 46 civilian injuries. If these figures are at all representative, that means many, many more Americans are injured or killed across all 20,000 raids.

“No-knock” raids have also resulted in horror stories like a flash-bang grenade being thrown into the crib of a 19-month-old toddler and the shooting of a 7-year-old child.

True, these raids usually don’t end in violence. But every single “no-knock” warrant violates the sanctity of the home, the privacy of the individual, and fundamental property rights, all of which are longstanding tenets in the western tradition of liberty and in the founding ideas of America.

As James Bovard wrote for FEE 20 years ago:

Without private property, there is no escape from state power. Property rights are the border guards around an individual’s life that deter political invasions. Few government policies better symbolize the contempt for property rights than the rising number of no-knock raids. “A man’s home is his castle” has been an accepted rule of English common law since the early 1600s and required law-enforcement officials to knock on the door and announce themselves before entering a private home. But this standard has increasingly been rejected in favor of another ancient rule—“the king’s keys unlock all doors.”

The notion that “A man’s home is his castle,” as Bovard notes, is a fundamental American principle. It is enshrined in our Constitution, particularly through the Fourth Amendment, which recognizes Americans’ right to be free from “unreasonable searches and seizures” of their homes. It is hard to imagine any search less “reasonable” than one where armed-to-the-teeth police officers burst into your home in the dead of night—and don’t even announce themselves as law enforcement.

And conservatives especially should appreciate the insidious way in which “no-knock” raids undermine the Second Amendment and the right to self-defense. After all, Walker did exactly what many Americans who lawfully own guns would do: protect his home and family from armed intruders. For the exercise of this fundamental right, Taylor paid the ultimate price.

Policies like these compromise the sanctity of every American home. How can anyone exercise their right to self-defense to protect their home and family if they don’t know whether or not it's the police breaking down the door?

This is why Breonna Taylor’s story must not be allowed to fall through the cracks, and “no-knock” warrants cannot be allowed to stand.

The police officers involved in her case still have not faced any charges, and her mother is calling for justice, saying “I need people to know that her life mattered.”

If you need an outside consultant to explain to you that perhaps police officers who shoot a sleeping woman in the wrong apartment based on information from a Postal Inspector who later says he never spoke to police SHOULD NOT BE POLICE... — Jane Coaston (@cjane87) June 3, 2020

The only way to truly honor Taylor’s memory is to make sure this kind of tragedy never happens again—and that means banning “no-knock” warrants across the board. Thankfully, there is some political support across the ideological spectrum for this reform.

Congressional Democrats have introduced a police reform bill that would abolish “no-knock” warrants for federal drug cases, which doesn’t go far enough, but is at least a good start.

Meanwhile, Sen. Rand Paul, a libertarian-leaning Kentucky Republican, has led the charge against “no-knocks” from the Right. He was one of the first voices to speak out about Breonna Taylor’s tragic death, and has called for reform in no uncertain terms.

“I think it’s crazy that we’re breaking down people’s doors in the middle of the night,” the senator said in a conversation with Taylor’s aunt. “People are frightened. They don’t know what to do. They don’t know if it’s burglars.”

“I want to make sure that we don’t forget Breonna,” Paul continued. “That we try to make it better, so this doesn’t happen again.” The only way to do that is to consign “no-knock” warrants to the dustbin of history."	right

"President Trump announced from the White House Rose Garden Monday evening that he is ""mobilizing all available federal resources, civilian and military"" to stop violent protests across the country, decrying ""professional anarchists, looters, criminals, antifa and others"" whose actions have ""gripped"" the nation.

In order to deploy U.S. active-duty personnel to conduct law enforcement on American soil, the president must invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act. It has been used several times in U.S. history, including by President George H.W. Bush during the 1992 Los Angeles Riots.

jb3sv8	libertarian	Andrew Yang proposes that your digital data be considered personal property	"2020 Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang may not be at the top of the race when it comes to polling (Politico currently has him ranked as the 7th most-popular Democratic contender), but his policies, including support for universal basic income, have made him popular among a subset of young, liberal-leaning, tech-savvy voters. Yang’s latest proposal, too, is sure to strike a chord with them.

The presidential candidate published his latest policy proposal today: to treat data as a property right. Announcing the proposal on his website, Yang lamented how our data is collected, used, and abused by companies, often with little awareness or consent from us. “This needs to stop,” Yang says. “Data generated by each individual needs to be owned by them, with certain rights conveyed that will allow them to know how it’s used and protect it.”

The rights Yang is proposing:

The right to be informed as to what data will be collected, and how it will be used

The right to opt out of data collection or sharing

The right to be told if a website has data on you, and what that data is

The right to be forgotten; to have all data related to you deleted upon request

The right to be informed if ownership of your data changes hands

The right to be informed of any data breaches including your information in a timely manner

The right to download all data in a standardized format to port to another platform

The fourth point is notable because it seems to suggest Yang wants the same “right to be forgotten” laws that Europe currently offers. That’s something tech giants like Google have litigated vigorously. And you can be sure that many tech giants would lobby just as vigorously against some of his other “data as property” proposals.

Still, it’s refreshing to see a candidate so clearly outline his digital data policies. Whether that will help push him higher in the polls remains to be seen."	right
jv7qao	libertarian	Marijuana legalization is so popular it's defying the partisan divide: Conservatives cannot stop legalization	"Bill Stocker could be considered the archetype of a conservative voter: He's a retired Marine and former police officer who voted for President Trump. But he's also among the majority of South Dakota voters who broadly legalized marijuana this month.

Stocker, 61, said enforcing marijuana laws gets in the way of pursuing other drug crimes and called warnings about the ills of marijuana ""a bunch of baloney"" that even people in a Republican stronghold like South Dakota no longer believe.

South Dakota's values of ""personal responsibility and freedom"" won out, said Stocker, who lives in Sioux Falls.

The 2020 election helped prove how broadly accepted marijuana has become throughout the United States, with measures to legalize recreational pot also breezing to victory in progressive New Jersey, moderate Arizona and conservative Montana. Fifteen states have now broadly legalized it, while 36 states allow medical marijuana.

Voters in Mississippi overwhelmingly approved medical marijuana this month, giving the drug another foothold in the South.

A Gallup Poll released Nov. 9 indicated that 68% of Americans favor legalizing marijuana - double the approval rate in 2003. That wide margin was evident in the election, with marijuana measures passing with strong bipartisan support.

In South Dakota and Montana - where Republicans swept to victory in the key races - recreational marijuana passed with at least 16 percentage points more support than Democratic President-elect Joe Biden received. South Dakota also approved medical pot, which outpolled Mr. Biden by 34 percentage points.

""We've waged a war against this plant for a century and by any reasonable metric, that war has been an abject failure,"" said Matthew Schweich, deputy director of the Marijuana Policy Project, which favors legalization. ""All it's done is incarcerate millions of Americans, it has perpetuated racism in this country, and perhaps the worst injustice of all is that it's deprived us of medical marijuana research.""

Marijuana is still illegal at the federal level, hurting veterans who can't be prescribed medical pot at Veterans Affairs clinics, he said.

They ""come home with chronic pain and we're pushing them to opioids,"" Schweich said. ""That's crazy. That's unpatriotic and it's a disgrace.""

Support for legalization was around 25% in 1992 when then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton tried to avoid answering questions about whether he had used marijuana before finally saying in a television interview that he had experimented with the drug, didn't like it and ""didn't inhale.""

In early 2019, Kamala Harris - now the vice president-elect - was asked about her prior marijuana use during a radio interview and acknowledged that ""I did inhale.""

Brendan Johnson, a former U.S. attorney in South Dakota who supported the state's marijuana initiatives, said the campaign focused on the fact that in recent years 10% of arrests in the state were for marijuana, and most were small amounts.

""We have a real problem here where we have criminalized an entire generation of South Dakotans, and we're paying a price,"" Johnson said.

The owner of a chain of medical marijuana dispensaries in Billings, Montana, credited passage of the recreational marijuana initiative to a years-long campaign by medical marijuana supporters to educate the public about the benefits of cannabis.

""There has been a considerable change in the political demographic because people are educated, because they know Aunt Margaret tried it for her cancer and she can eat,"" said Richard Abromeit, owner of Montana Advanced Caregivers.

Advocates' next goal is to get marijuana removed from a federal list of illegal drugs with no accepted medical use and high potential for abuse. The listing prevents labs from researching potential medical remedies using marijuana.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told lawmakers last week that he would hold a vote in December on a bill that would decriminalize cannabis, create a process to expunge nonviolent pot convictions and remove the drug from the Controlled Substances Act. It's not clear if the bill could pass both chambers.

The outcome of two runoff elections in Georgia could determine how the issue might fare in the Senate, where Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has impeded its progress.

Other states are expected to consider marijuana legislation next year, which could put more pressure on Congress to act.

Supporters argue that the industry creates jobs and raises tax money to help prop up governments that are hurting because of business closures tied to the COVID-19 pandemic.

But some oppose broad legalization.

Republican Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota argued that marijuana leads people to use other, more-addictive drugs, while law enforcement officers and prosecutors in Montana asserted that legal pot would lead to more drugged driving and other crimes, while exacerbating mental health issues.

The Gallup Poll says just under half of Republicans, people who identify as politically conservative and those who attend church on a weekly basis say they think marijuana should be legal.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, widely known as the Mormon church, strongly opposed Arizona's broad legalization measure despite supporting medical marijuana in Utah.

Chris Nylen, 50, of Flagstaff, Arizona, is a Trump supporter who voted to legalize recreational marijuana. She said her feelings evolved after a CBD pill, made from hemp and prescribed by a veterinarian, eased her dog's anxiety and arthritis.

""I'm so old school,"" she said. ""I personally don't have a desire for it, but (I'm) seeing the benefits for my dog."""	right
m0j3tw	libertarian	Biden Voter On CNN: “They’re Dropping Bombs In Syria And Those Bombs Are Pretty Expensive For A Guy Who Owes Me $ 2,000”	"CNN went to a blue suburb of Minneapolis in an effort to create more fake news and shield the Biden administration.

They picked Democrats voters for their interview, but one of the participants decided to blast President Biden and his administration.

The video couldn’t be seen on CNN anymore but internet sleuths managed to download the part of the video where the young Democrat Ben Calvert, 27 spoke against Biden and upload it again on YouTube.

Ben is fast losing faith with Democrats given that they are in charge in the White House, the Senate and the House. “A lot of my friends are really frustrated because they were like, ‘We’ve got to elect these two senators in Georgia! We’ve got to get Joe Biden in office and then everything’s going to be better! It’s not a $1,400 dollar check, it’s $2,000 checks,'” Ben said, making gloved air quotes.

“But now, they’re putting that stimulus check and minimum wage hike on the back burner while they’re dropping bombs in Syria. And those bombs are kind of expensive for a dude who owes me $2,000.”

Video below:

Joe Biden’s killed tens of thousands of energy jobs his first day in office when he canceled contracts with the Keystone XL pipeline.

Biden also bombed Syria to punish Iran for its attacks on US forces in Iraq.

Rep. Matt Gaetz blasted Biden yesterday for his broken promises: “Joe Biden has had more attacks on Syria than he’s had press conferences and so you have to ask the progressive voters, is this really what you expected?”

Joe Biden also promised that $2,000 checks would go out the door “immediately” if the Democrats won the senate – the $2,000 has turned into $1400 and the Democrats narrowed the eligibility for stimulus payments.

It looks like this Democrat voter learned the hard way that Joe Biden and the Democrat party say one thing on the campaign trail and do another when in office."	right

hx0k2k	libertarian	Trump administration tries to block release of a documentary that shows ICE agents illegally breaking into home, eager to arrest immigrants without criminal records	"""Immigration Nation,"" a six-part Netflix documentary, began filming in 2017, its creators embedded within US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The documentary shows ICE agents lying to immigrants, illegally breaking into a home, and expressing joy at being told to ""arrest as many people as possible,"" The New York Times reported.

The Trump administration tried to block the work from being released until after the 2020 election, according to The Times.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The Trump administration fought to prevent the release of a new Netflix documentary that provides a behind-the-scenes look at its immigration policy in action, The New York Times reported Thursday.

Filmmakers Shaul Schwarz and Christina Clusiau began work on the project soon after President Trump was inaugurated, embedding with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and given ""rare access to parts of the country's powerful immigration enforcement machinery that are usually invisible to the public,"" The Times reported.

Although the project was approved by ICE leadership, the Trump administration sought to block the release of the final product until after the 2020 election — and to prevent the release of certain segments altogether.

According to The Times, the six-part documentary shows ""ICE officers lying to immigrants to gain access to their homes,"" and depicts one officer ""illegally picking the lock to an apartment building during a raid.""

And while the agency publicly claimed to be prioritizing the deportation of murderers and rapists, The Times reported that ""the filmmakers observed numerous occasions in which officers expressed satisfaction after being told by supervisors to arrest as many people as possible, even those without criminal records.""

A spokesperson for ICE, Jenny Burke told The Times the agency ""wholeheartedly disputes the allegations brought forward by filmmakers of this production"" and denied the claims.

But the agency was not able to stop its release: ""Immigration Nation"" is set to appear on Netflix in August.

kg9g5r	libertarian	As Congress struggles to approve $900 billion in stimulus funding, a new report shows management of last loan program was so bad an audit can't be done on where $670 billion in taxpayer money went	"The $670 billion PPP loan program cannot be audited due to poor management, an oversight agency disclosed in a report Friday evening.

The Office of the Inspector General for the Small Business Administration also noted glaring mistakes, such as $6 billion in loans not disbursed.

The SBA pushed back on five of the seven issues noted by auditors, and noted the PPP and other 2020 loan programs were historic in scope.

""The SBA fully supports the requirements for auditability of its financial statements,"" the agency said in a rebuttal to the report.

The PPP program has been accused of fraud, waste, and mismanagement — and of not providing sufficient records to the public.

The report comes as Congress struggles to pass another massive stimulus package for the nation.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

As Congress struggles to approve $900 billion in stimulus funding this weekend, a new report Friday evening says this year's COVID-19 relief loan program was so badly managed that an audit cannot be conducted to see where hundreds of billions in taxpayer dollars went.

The $670 billion Paycheck Protection Program was so poorly documented by the US Small Business Administration that an audit cannot be conducted, the accounting firm KPMG said in a report Friday, and noted glaring mistakes including $6 billion in loans that were approved for US businesses — but never delivered. The KPMG audit was part of a report from the Office of the Inspector General for the US Small Business Administration.

The report also noted nearly $200 billion in loans were approved despite being flagged as potentially illegal, and nearly 900,000 accounting errors were not addressed.

But sources close to the report, who noted it was signed off on late Friday just under a deadline, said the most striking aspect was the auditor saying records were so insufficient the firm could not evaluate one of the largest lending programs in US history, which has been accused of fraud, waste, and abuse.

""KPMG auditors found significant matters for which they were unable to obtain sufficient, appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for an audit,"" the Office of the Inspector General for the US Small Business Administration wrote in the report.

The SBA pushed back on the report in a Friday memo that disagreed with five of the seven findings of mismanagement. ""The scope and scale of these programs and the speed with which the SBA responded were unprecedented in its history,"" Tami Perriello, the agency's chief financial officer, wrote. ""The SBA fully supports the requirements for auditability of its financial statements and understands its obligations for providing accountability and transparency."" The SBA did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.

KPMG, a 200-year-old global accounting firm, said in its report that ""SBA was unable to provide adequate evidential matter in support of a significant number of transactions and account balances related to these programs due to inadequate processes and controls.""

KPMG noted glaring errors related to the agency's mismanagement:

The SBA approved 2 million guaranteed loans worth $189 billion despite the loans being flagged as potentially not in conformance with the CARES Act and related legislation.

The SBA reported approximately $6 billion of PPP loans approved but not disbursed due to unreported or unprocessed reports.

The SBA did not address 896,000 accounting errors in the outstanding loans.

KPMG urged the SBA to implement closer supervision. ""We recommend the Administrator to coordinate with the Chief Financial Officer to assign and hold accountable individuals responsible for overseeing management's design, implementation, and operation of SBA's internal control system.""

Despite the SBA's protests, KPMG stood by its work in a brief rebuttal, and the OIG said it found ""no instances where KPMG did not comply in all material respects with US generally accepted government auditing standards.""

This is not the first time government auditors have cited the SBA for mismanagement. In October, the Government Accountability Office warned Congress of a lack of internal safeguards.

The Trump administration, meanwhile, has sought less scrutiny into the loan program, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin suggesting in July that the government wipe out the debt from the guaranteed loans without evaluating how the money was spent, beyond some fraud controls.

The battle over auditing the $670 billion program comes as Congress hustles in a last-ditch effort to strike a deal on a $900 billion federal rescue package by midnight Sunday."	right
jj4q1z	libertarian	No Drugs Should Be Criminalized. It’s Time to Abolish the DEA.	"In 1970, the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) was passed by the Nixon administration, codifying a national strategy to prohibit drug use and target certain communities. Since then, the “war on drugs” has failed to reduce supply or demand, while steadily increasing drug overdose deaths and perpetuating the stigmatization of individuals with addiction. It has fueled wide-scale militarized policing, cost taxpayers over $1 trillion since its inception, and expanded punitive institutions outside of the criminal legal system — including punishment-oriented systems embedded in schools, hospitals and social service agencies. After 50 years of failures and substantial evidence that drug prohibition is not only ineffective but also incredibly counterproductive, we clearly cannot afford another 50 years of the same. The time has come to repeal the Controlled Substances Act and transition toward a more evidence based and realistic approach to drug use in our society.

On its face, the CSA’s stated purpose to create a tiered system with five categories based on potential for problematic use, medical use and safety sounds like a reasonable plan. But the reality is far more grim. It has been primarily wielded as a political hammer to justify arbitrarily criminalizing and targeting certain marginalized communities, and used to restrict research that might prove any kind of medicinal benefits.

And while most would agree the war on drugs has been a failure when it comes to public health, we must recognize that it has accomplished its architects’ real goals. Since the Controlled Substances Act was enacted 50 years ago, drug arrests — the vast majority of which have been for possession alone — and incarceration rates in the United States have skyrocketed, decimating communities of color which have been disproportionately targeted. In 2019 alone, there were over 1.5 million drug arrests made, nearly 87 percent of which were for possession. And regardless of whether or not people arrested on drug charges are convicted, an arrest alone can prevent people from accessing employment and educational opportunities, housing, or government nutritional assistance programs like SNAP and TANF. It can even cost them their children or immigration status.

As arrests have increased, political leaders have vilified drugs and the people who use them, painting them as a dangerous part of society. Those who use drugs recreationally or might struggle with substance use disorder have been labeled “criminals” and pushed even further to the margins of society, creating a web of life-altering challenges and reinforcing stigma and fear that prevents people from accessing help if they need it.

The drug war’s pattern of destruction is vast: it is also one of the main forces responsible for the militarized policing that the nation has been reckoning with since the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. Because of funding schemes connected to the drug war — such as civil asset forfeiture laws, the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant and 1033 programs — local police departments receive military weapons transfers and other financial incentives connected to drug arrests, which put our communities further in the crosshairs of state-sanctioned violence.

The Controlled Substances Act also serves as an enduring vehicle of government waste, costing over 1 trillion taxpayer dollars in the first 40 years alone. In fact, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the federal agency tasked with implementation and enforcement of the CSA, had an annual operating budget of $3.136 billion in 2019, yet, 47 years after its creation and countless lives lost, it has failed to accomplish its sole stated purpose of reducing the illicit drug supply. Drugs are more accessible now than ever before.

It is time to reshape American drug policy away from the antiquated, draconian punitive approaches of the past and into a new era of scientifically informed, evidence-based, human-centered policies.

Not only is it wasteful, but spending this extent of money on failed drug enforcement and incarceration limits funding for more effective programs that impact public safety, including addiction treatment, mental health services, public education funding and employment opportunities — all of which could greatly improve the standards of living for all people, especially in the communities most targeted for enforcement.

Proponents of the drug war have argued that banning certain substances should remove them from the market, while prosecuting drug use should lower demand. But it turns out, the opposite is true. Since 1970, drug overdoses have steadily increased, with approximately 70,000 people dying per year from accidental drug overdose in recent years, and new data shows a concerning upward trajectory over the last year and more acutely since the COVID-19 pandemic began.

Alternatively, countries such as Portugal and Switzerland that have decriminalized drug use have seen demand and overdose rates decline, in addition to other health benefits such as greatly reducing infectious diseases, all while removing the burden of a criminal record and the many collateral consequences that follow.

It’s time we follow their evidence. And that means building a public health-centered approach to drugs.

By abolishing the DEA and decriminalizing all drugs, we could save tens of billions of dollars annually, which could be redirected toward funding research and health services, such as evidence-based treatment, harm reduction and other health and housing resources. These steps could greatly improve the lives of people who use drugs, begin repairing the devastation caused by the drug war and reduce the cost burden on taxpayers to fund failed enforcement and incarceration.

After 50 years of failure, it is time to reshape American drug policy away from the antiquated, draconian punitive approaches of the past and into a new era of scientifically informed, evidence-based, human-centered policies.

kpm727	libertarian	Cop Indicted for Leaking Video of Cops Shoving Baton in Man's Mouth Until He Died	"Spread the love





101





Joliet, IL — Joliet police Sgt. Javier Esqueda is a good cop. We can say this with certainty because he proved it by refusing to stay silent about the alleged criminal acts of his fellow cops and risked his career and now his freedom to shine light into darkness. He watched a video of his fellow officers appear to suffocate a man until he died and decided that enough was enough.

For exposing the crimes of his fellow cops, Esqueda was arrested and subsequently indicted this week and charged on four counts of official misconduct for accessing a video of alleged criminal activity within his own department.

The complaint states that on June 10, Esqueda “knowingly performed an act with (sic) he knew to be forbidden by law to perform in that he used the laptop in his Joliet Police Department squad car while not on duty to access the Joliet Police Department WatchGuard system to view a video file which was locked and he did so while in a motor vehicle which passed through Kendall County. All of the foregoing occurred in Kendall County, Illinois.”

Joliet Police Chief Al Roechner orchestrated criminal charges against Esqueda after he brought shame on the department in July for leaking the video.

“What is most sad about this is that this is a clear message from Chief Roechner to the frontline officers that should they see actions they believe are misconduct by fellow officers, they must keep their mouths shut and stay quiet or they will be charged with a felony,” Esqueda’s lawyer Jeff Tomczak told Patch. He then predicted that Esqueda will get a goldmine – from the taxpayers of Joliet and Illinois — as a result of a future federal lawsuit that Esqueda is now certain to file against the city of Joliet and the Joliet Police Department of Chief Roechner, according to Patch.

Because prosecutors in Esqueda’s county had nothing on which to charge the officer Tomczak says the chief went to a neighboring county to seek out a favor in charging the good cop.

“I also have no doubt in my mind that these charges were shopped around and Will County prosecutors declined, as they should, so they went shopping in Kendall County and were able to find a prosecutor to file these bad charges.”

“I am anticipating winning and I am anticipating this case ends with a big fat federal judgment against the city of Joliet and every officer involved in these charges,” Tomczak assured Patch.

The idea that an officer, who did his job and exposed criminals to hold them accountable, would subsequently be arrested for this heroic act, speaks to the nature of the thin blue line. When examining the case Esqueda exposed, the fact that this is being covered up is horrifying.

As TFTP previously reported, his name was Eric Lurry.

On January 29, police targeted Lurry because they suspected him of having a substance deemed illegal by the state.

According to CBS 2, Nicole Lurry said her husband had just finished getting his license to be a barber, and was enrolled in school to become an instructor at the barber school. But in late January, the 37-year-old – who had served time before for drugs – got arrested again.

When police arrested Lurry, they put him in the back of a squad car and suspected him of putting drugs in his mouth. Because the state claims the right to kidnap, cage, beat, and kill people over arbitrary substances, when Lurry was put in the back of the car, he was essentially tortured.

In an attempt to get Lurry to spit out the drugs, police held his nose closed while shoving a baton in his mouth and slapping him. This torture went on for nearly two entire minutes until Lurry fell unconscious and eventually died.

Though the Will County coroner’s office ruled his death an accident due to heroin, fentanyl and cocaine intoxication, Esqueda disagrees, so do many other folks who watched the video.

“He was suffocating,” Esqueda said. “In my opinion, anybody would suffocate in that situation.”

For five months, the department kept the video secret while clearing the cops involved. Nicole Lurry never knew of the video’s existence until Esqueda blew the whistle after he came across it.

Adding to the egregious act of hiding such damning evidence is the fact that the audio had been turned off after the officers were seen slapping Lurry.

“It was almost like the supervisor looks off and says something to somebody, and then you hear the sound cut out. That’s what alerted me that possibly, they were trying to get rid of evidence,” Esqueda said.

“So there was a deliberate, initial act to turn off the audio or get rid of the audio?” CBS 2 reporters asked Sgt. Esqueda.

“There had to be. There’s no way that can happen,” he said.

If all cops had this resolve, America would be in a much better place than where we currently find ourselves.

Esqueda told reporters that he leaked the video because he wanted to prove that not all cops are bad.

“In light of everything that’s’ been happening – you know George Floyd really had a lot of us police officers. When we saw that video, a lot of us cried. People don’t believe that. But the thing is, there are a lot of good officers out of 750,000. Not everybody is a bad cop. Most cops that I know were upset by George Floyd,” he said.

Obviously not all cops are bad people. However, if we look at Esqueda’s case, all the officers involved in Lurry’s death, the supervisors, the chief, literally everyone but Esqueda was willing to look the other way. This would imply that all the cops in the Joliet police department are bad — except for Esqueda.

Even officials outside the police department whose “investigation” found that depriving Lurry of air for nearly two minutes played no role in his death.

The entire Joliet Police Department upper administration, Will-Grundy Major Crimes Task Force, Coroner Patrick O’Neil and State’s Attorney James Glasgow all stayed silent about Lurry’s death, highlighting the systemic and corrupt code of silence.

And now, the only man facing accountability in Lurry’s death is the one who exposed it.

m8i5if	libertarian	Biden ousting staffers for pot use -- even when they only smoked in states where it's legal: report | Joe Biden's commitment to staff his White House with the best people possible has run head-on into his decades-long support for America's war on drugs.	"Joe Biden's commitment to staff his White House with the best people possible has run head-on into his decades-long support for America's war on drugs.

""Dozens of young White House staffers have been suspended, asked to resign or placed in a remote work program due to past marijuana use, frustrating staffers who were pleased by initial indications from the Biden administration that recreational use of cannabis would not be immediately disqualifying for would-be personnel, according to three people familiar with the situation. The policy has even affected staffers whose marijuana use was exclusive to one of the 14 states—and the District of Columbia—where cannabis is legal,"" The Daily Beast reported Thursday evening.

""Sources familiar with the matter also said a number of young staffers were either put on probation or canned because they revealed they had used marijuana in the past in an official document they filled out for the position in the Biden White House during a lengthy background check,"" The Beast reported. ""In some cases, staffers were informally told by transition higher-ups ahead of formally joining the administration that they would likely overlook some past marijuana use, only to be asked later to resign.""

The Beast interviewed one former Biden White House staffer.

""There were one-on-one calls with individual affected staffers—rather, ex-staffers,"" the former staffer said. ""I was asked to resign.""

""Nothing was ever explained"" on the calls, the source said. ""The policies were never explained, the threshold for what was excusable and what was inexcusable was never explained.""

The calls were led by Anne Filipic, White House director of management and administration.

The White House attempted to defend the policy of blackballing people who have used marijuana.

""The White House's policy will maintain the absolute highest standards for service in government that the president expects from his administration, while acknowledging the reality that state and local marijuana laws have changed significantly across the country in recent years,"" an unnamed spokesperson said. ""This decision was made following intensive consultation with career security officials and will effectively protect our national security while modernizing policies to ensure that talented and otherwise well-qualified applicants with limited marijuana use will not be barred from serving the American people.""

Former Obama-era National Security Council spokesperson Tommy Vietor blasted the policy.

""I find it absurd that, in 2021, marijuana use is still part of a security clearance background check,"" said Vietor. ""To me, marijuana use is completely irrelevant when you're trying to decide whether an individual should be trusted with national security information."""	right

U.S.A. –-(Ammoland.com)- On 20 August 2015, in Brevard County, Florida, John DeRossett, 55, shot and severely wounded a Brevard County sheriff’s deputy.

The agent was part of a sting operation, who were attempting to arrest DeRossett’s niece, Mary Ellis, for prostitution. They had set up a controlled environment at a motel, but Mary Ellis did not show up. From floridatoday.com:

Brevard County agents set up a prostitution sting on Aug. 20, 2015, arranging to meet DeRossett’s niece, Mary Ellis, at a motel where a controlled environment had been set up to conduct an arrest. When she didn’t show, the three deputies in plain clothes went to her Covina Street home in Port St. John, where Agent Peter Stead grabbed Ellis from the doorway while John “Casey” Smith and Jason Roberts hid in the darkened yard. During their testimony at the immunity hearing, the deputies said it was unusual to go to a suspect’s home for a sting operation when a controlled environment had already been established. When she was grabbed, Ellis began screaming for help from her uncle, who was in a back room eating at the time, according to court records.

There was strong evidence DeRossett did not know the men accosting his niece were deputies. None of the deputies were in uniform. His statements, immediately after the event, and in the hospital, were all consistent with the belief that unknown men were attempting to kidnap his niece. He knew his niece had problems with drugs and prostitution.

DeRossett was retired. He had a concealed carry permit. He had no criminal record. He had taken his niece into his home as a favor to his sister. From the Petition to the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeals:

Petitioner, John DeRossett, a sixty-five-year-old retired General Motors autoworker, owned a home in Brevard County, Florida. Derossett’s adult niece, Mary Ellis, lived with him in this home. Derossett had no criminal record, worked part-time as a security guard at Port Canaveral, and lawfully possessed a concealed weapons permit. He had also apparently taken a firearms training course.

On August 20, 2015, at approximately 9:30 p.m., Ellis answered a knock on the front door. As she opened the door, a man reached inside the threshold of the house, grabbed her arm, and began pulling Ellis out of the home and onto the covered front porch. Ellis struggled to resist her apparent abduction and screamed to her uncle (DeRossett) that she needed help. At this point, two other men approached to physically assist the first man in pulling Ellis off the porch of the home and into the front yard.

John DeRossett was in a backroom, eating, when he heard her screams. It was dark outside the home.

The first shot was when DeRossett fired a “warning shot” into the air. The men who had accosted his niece (the deputies) then fired at him, without identifying themselves. A firefight ensued. One deputy, John “Casey” Smith, was severely wounded. More than 40 shots were fired. Both John DeRossett and his Niece were wounded, but less severely.

The homeowner, DeRossett, was charged with three counts of attempted murder of a police officer.

Police claimed they told the niece they were police officers as they grabbed her. She called 911 during or immediately after the firefight, and told the dispatcher she did not know who the men who grabbed her were.

The deputies had no warrant to arrest Mary Ellis.

Criminals often claim to be police to attempt to get compliance. The deputies never told DeRossett they were police.

Why would he be under obligation to believe them, unless they presented credentials or other convincing proof they were operating under lawful authority?

DeRossett was held in jail for nearly five years!

In August of 2018, at trial, his lawyer presented the defense that he was protected by the “Stand Your Ground” law. The local court found against him, saying that he knew, or should have known, the people he was shooting at were law enforcement officers.

He appealed to the federal Fifth Circuit Court of appeals in 2019.

The appeals court found the local court had incorrectly made the determination DeRossett should have known the men attacking his niece, and him, were police officers. The Fifth Circuit sent the case back to the local court, to determine if a different exception to Stand your Ground applied. The Stand Your Ground law would not apply if he was “furthering criminal activities” when the action took place.

The local court found against him again. This time, the court claimed the Stand Your Ground law did not apply, because he knew his niece had used her bedroom to conduct prostitution.

DeRossett appealed to the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeals again.

He stayed in jail until March of 2020, when he was allowed to bond out.

On 15 April, the Fifth District Court of Appeals dismissed the charges against him. They ruled that mere knowledge that criminal activities, such as prostitution, had occurred, is not “furthering criminal activities”. From clickorlando.com:

VIERA, Fla. – Citing the Stand Your Ground law, the Fifth District Court of Appeals dismissed the longstanding charges against a Port St. John man accused of shooting a Brevard County Sheriff’s deputy during a botched arrest in front of his home in 2015.

John DeRossett spent nearly five years in jail, for defending his niece against attackers who did not identify themselves as police.

John DeRossett is a free man today. He is alive. There was a time, when many assumed anyone, justified or not, who shot a police officer, would be killed by police. That is not true. It is less true today than it used to be.

In Houston, police officers have been charged with felony murder in the deaths of an innocent couple. The husband dared to protect his wife and dog against an unannounced home invasion. The couple were killed, but the officers are being held accountable.

Mistakes occur. Error is piled onto error. The world is not perfect.

Why, with the evidence, which was plain from the start, was John DeRossett locked up for nearly five years, when he was a homeowner, retired, who had no previous criminal record?

Will there be a civil suit against Brevard County?

The agents of the government are not supposed to be our masters. They are supposed to be our servants.

When agents of the government act as criminals, they should not be surprised when citizens treat them as criminals. When they disregard due process, they should lose immunity for their actions.

The case shows why the Stand Your Ground law was needed. Warrants are not only to protect the accused. Properly used, they also protect police. If the officer had a warrant, had knocked on the door and presented it, it is highly likely he would not have been shot.

io77g3	libertarian	Louisville detective fired over killing of Breonna Taylor	"One of three Kentucky police officers involved in the killing of Breonna Taylor this year was fired Tuesday, authorities said.

In a two-page letter to Louisville Metro Police Department detective Brett Hankison, chief Robert J. Schroeder said that the detective violated department rules, procedures and deadly force standards when Taylor was killed.

When Hankison and two other plainclothes officers used a “no-knock” warrant to enter Taylor’s apartment March 13, he “wantonly and blindly” fired 10 rounds, Schroeder wrote.

“These rounds created a substantial danger of death and serious injury to Breonna Taylor and the three occupants of the apartment next to Ms. Taylor’s,” he said.

Schroeder added that Hankison fired those rounds without knowing if that deadly force was directed at someone who posed an immediate threat.

Louisville police officer Brett Hankison. Louisville Metro Police Department

“Based upon my review, these are extreme violations of our policies,” he wrote. “I find your conduct a shock to the conscience.”

The two other officers who were with Hankison have been placed on administrative leave.

The death of Taylor, a 26-year-old African American emergency-room technician, has drawn widespread criticism. It spawned memes, prompted protests around the country and led to a local ban — ""Breonna's Law"" — on ""no-knock"" warrants.

Taylor was shot to death around 12:40 a.m. during a drug investigation focused on a “trap house” several miles away, her family has said. Her address was listed on the warrant because the apartment had allegedly been used to receive mail or keep drugs for a man authorities were searching for named Jamarcus Glover, who was already in police custody when Taylor's home was raided, according to the according to The Courier-Journal in Louisville.

Authorities have said the officers knocked several times and announced their presence before forcing their way into Taylor’s apartment. A lawsuit filed by her family contests this.

Police said the officers were “immediately” met by gunfire when they entered the home. The suit says that Taylor and her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, 27, believed their apartment was being broken into, so Walker called 911 and fired at what he believed was an intruder, striking an officer in the leg.

Walker had a license for the firearm, and no drugs were found in the apartment during the raid, the lawsuit says.

Walker was charged with assault and attempted murder of a police officer.

After Hankison’s termination letter was released last week, lawyers for Taylor’s family argued that Kentucky’s attorney general, who has been appointed as a special prosecutor in the case, should file criminal charges against the officer.

“By the department's own assessment, he committed wanton endangerment, wanton murder and wanton attempted murder,"" lawyers Benjamin Crump, Lonita Baker and Sam Aguiar said in a joint statement.

Attorney General Daniel Cameron did not immediately comment on Hankison’s firing. During a news conference last week, Cameron said he understood the “urgency” and “public outcry” around the case, but said he would provide no timeline on his office's investigation.

“We are not going to strike foul blows in this case,” he said. “We are going to pursue the truth based on the law, whether that leads to convictions or exonerations.”

The Louisville police union did not immediately respond to a request for comment."	right
hzmjoj	libertarian	Democrats Wimp Out on Federal Marijuana Legalization. Thanks, Joe Biden!	"It's 2020 and the leadership of the Democratic Party still cannot get it together on marijuana legalization, which two-thirds of Americans support.

According to Pew polling data, support for full legalization crossed the 50 percent threshold back in 2010 and has been growing ever since. Much like support for gay marriage recognition, this seems to be a permanent cultural shift in attitudes.

But unlike the Democratic Party's embrace of gay marriage, its leadership cannot seem to line up behind marijuana legalization, even as the Black Lives Matter and criminal justice reform movements highlight precisely how the drug war has led to the overpolicing and harassment of black communities.

Marijuana Moment reports that on Monday the Democratic National Committee rejected an amendment to put a plank supporting marijuana legalization into the party's platform. The final vote against, 50-106, is almost a perfect inversion of the two-thirds of the public who want legalization.

Instead, Marijuana Moment reports, the platform will retain language that Democratic nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden hammered out with a criminal justice task force that included Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I–Vt.) supporters. It stops short of marijuana legalization but does call for federal reforms:

""Democrats will decriminalize marijuana use and reschedule it through executive action on the federal level. We will support legalization of medical marijuana, and believe states should be able to make their own decisions about recreational use. The Justice Department should not launch federal prosecutions of conduct that is legal at the state level. All past criminal convictions for cannabis use should be automatically expunged.""

It's nice that the Democrats say that the Justice Department ""should not launch federal prosecutions,"" but that's fundamentally meaningless as a policy proposal. Remember all the screaming that President Donald Trump has too much influence over a Justice Department some believe should be operating independently? Shifting marijuana so that it's in a less restrictive schedule in the Controlled Substances Act will still give the Justice Department plenty of reasons to go after marijuana users and dealers should they choose to.

And while the Justice Department isn't a huge driver of marijuana arrests and prosecutions these days, it does still happen, particularly when people are caught trying to transport marijuana across state lines from states where it has been legalized to states where it has not been. Just in June, for example, the Drug Enforcement Administration filed federal charges against an attorney they caught allegedly conspiring to fly cannabis oil across the country from California in a private Learjet for sale elsewhere. The man now faces a mandatory minimum sentence of five years in prison if convicted.

On the state and local level, marijuana offenses still account for 40 percent of drug-related arrests. And the vast majority of those arrests (more than 90 percent) are for possession, not manufacture or sale.

These aren't small numbers, but Biden, after all these years, is still resistant to full marijuana legalization. He brags about being a leader in publicly embracing gay marriage, reversing his old position against it and embracing it in 2012—even before President Barack Obama would publicly do so.

But with marijuana, Biden's historical support of harsh criminal justice tactics has weakened but not faded. And it appears that the Democratic leadership is unwilling to force Biden to accept the reality that Americans would strongly prefer marijuana to be fully legalized, not just decriminalized. While decriminalization is an improvement, it leaves in place mechanisms for unequal enforcement, and research shows that black people are more likely to still be arrested or punished for marijuana possession than white people in states where marijuana has only been decriminalized. And overall, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, marijuana arrest rates in states where the drug has been decriminalized are about eight times higher than in states where it has been fully legalized.

The federalist component of the platform is laudable from a libertarian perspective, if for no reason other than continued state-level legalization shows that the world isn't ending in states that have given the citizenry permission to toke up. Their successes should make other states less afraid to follow suit. It's not unlike how state-level recognition of gay marriage showed that it was ultimately not a big deal and as the public saw more of these relationships and families, resistance largely crumbled away.

Nevertheless, it's absurd for the Democratic Party to want to use the current activism for criminal justice and police reform as a contrast to Trump's cheerleading for crackdowns, but they can't even force Biden to accept the simplest and most popular of drug war reforms that will—in very profound and important ways—reduce overpolicing of black communities."	right
lrd6qi	libertarian	After suing Mike Lindell, Sidney Powell, and Rudy Giuliani, Dominion says it will go after others who spread claims of election fraud - truth does matter it turns out.	"Dominion's defamation lawsuit against Mike Lindell is ""definitely"" not its last, its CEO told CNBC.

Lindell, Sidney Powell, and Rudy Giuliani made baseless claims about Dominion's voting machines.

Asked whether the company would sue Fox News, John Poulos said Dominion was ""not ruling anyone out.""

Visit the Business section of Insider for more stories.

Dominion Voting Systems' CEO said the company would continue to take legal action against people who spread baseless claims that its voting machines were used to ""steal"" the 2020 US presidential election.

Dominion has already filed defamation lawsuits against MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, the pro-Trump attorney Sidney Powell, and former President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, seeking at least $1.3 billion in damages in each case.

Dominion CEO John Poulos told CNBC on Tuesday that the filing against Lindell on Monday was ""definitely not the last lawsuit.""

Dominion has sent cease-and-desist notices and warnings to preserve documents to more than 150 people, The Washington Post reported. This includes the media outlets Fox News, Newsmax, and One America News.

Asked whether the company would sue Fox News, Poulos said Dominion was ""not ruling anyone out.""

As conspiracy theories sprung up around the election, one posited that Dominion and Smartmatic, a rival election-technology company, developed technology that ""flipped"" votes from Trump to Joe Biden through a method developed with the regime of the late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chávez.

The theory has been thoroughly debunked. But that didn't stop Powell and Giuliani from pushing elements of the theory while filing a series of failed lawsuits seeking to overturn the results of the election. Lindell has also spread misinformation about the machines, saying Dominion ""built them to cheat.""

A Fox News representative told Insider earlier in February that the network ran several ""fact-check"" segments ""prior to any lawsuit chatter."" While several of its news shows reported that there was no evidence of Dominion's systems changing votes, Fox News, in particular its opinion hosts, ""questioned the results of the election or pushed conspiracy theories about it at least 774 times"" in the two weeks after the network called the race, according to Media Matters.

On February 4, Smartmatic filed a $2.7 billion lawsuit against Fox News over election conspiracy theories, saying it had ""damaged democracy worldwide."" Fox News said it fairly reported and commented on ""allegations in a hotly contested"" election and asked a judge to dismiss the defamation lawsuit.

Insider has contacted Fox News for comment on Poulos' remarks.

Lindell called 'reckless' in his peddling of disinformation

Poulos told CNBC that Lindell's claims were ""absolute nonsense,"" adding that what the controversial CEO touted as evidence was actually ""fake documents.""

Poulos said the voter-fraud theory had caused ""devastating"" reputational damage to the company.

He said Americans could be ""forgiven for believing"" the claims because they were touted as facts.

Despite naming both Lindell and MyPillow in the lawsuit, Poulos said Dominion didn't want to put the pillow company out of business.

""The larger point is to get the facts on the table in front of a court of law where evidence is properly judged,"" he said.

In the lawsuit, Dominion listed various promotional codes that MyPillow had used to offer online discounts, including ""QAnon"" and ""FightforTrump.""

Poulos told CNBC that Lindell used the codes to attract people to MyPillow's website.

In the lawsuit, Dominion said Lindell's voter-fraud claims had caused MyPillow's sales to surge by up to 40%.

But Lindell told Insider he expected to lose money as well over the claims — which he stood by — including an estimated $65 million in revenue this year he attributed to boycotts from retailers including Bed Bath & Beyond and Kohl's."	right
hxlsc1	libertarian	A homeless man was charged with assault after a police officer bloodied his fist while punching him. They're literally trying to send a man to prison for hurting a cop's fist with his face. Cause for arrest? Taking up two seats in a half empty car.	"The Legal Aid Society is demanding two NYPD officers be fired after they allegedly used excessive force in the form of punching, choking and macing a homeless man who was sleeping on the subway, the group claims.

Bodycam video, which was recorded in late May (before the death of George Floyd and the subsequent nationwide protests) but not released until Wednesday, shows the violent arrest that occurred shortly after midnight. In the disturbing clip, transit officers beat and dragged a man off a nearly empty 6 train car who they accused of taking up two seats, leaving him crying, bloody and fearing for his life.

Officer Adonis Long can be seen in the video motioning for Joseph Troiano to get off the train after violating MTA rules and lying down on multiple seats. Troiano exits the train car, but then hops into the one right behind it.

Long can be heard saying that Troiano is holding up the train, telling him to ""step off or I got to drag you off."" Troiano argues with him, insisting he's taking it to Brooklyn. The officer approaches Troiano and the incident quickly turns physical. The NYPD said officers used force on the 30-year-old because he attempted to strike the officer and resisted arrest.

The officer takes him by the shoulder, and when Troiano shoves the officer's arm off of him, the cop strikes him in the side of the head multiple times. The former hairdresser gets thrown from the train, and while Troiano is on the platform, video shows the officer use mace at point-blank range. A lawyer for the homeless man said the video also shows police choking him, with hands seen around his neck at one point.

Just released this morning, footage from a couple months ago surfaced of police officers aggressively arresting a man, Melissa Russo reports.

The body cam video was edited by the Legal Aid Society. NBC New York requested the unedited tape, but was not sent a copy of it.

According to the criminal complaint, Troiano was charged with misdemeanor resisting arrest and second degree assault — a felony, as the charges claimed he kicked one officer's right hand, injuring him.

However, after NBC New York inquired about the case, a spokesman for the Manhattan district attorney said that after viewing the video for the first time Tuesday night, the DA would be dismissing that felony charge next week. In a statement, they also implied that their office is looking into any potential police misconduct.

Troiano's lawyer said that if the officer's hand was injured, it likely was not his client's fault.

""If you look at the video, and see the way he punches Joseph, then perhaps he got the injury that way,"" said Edda Ness of the Legal Aid Society.

Troiano was apparently a victim of a slashing on Rikers Island in 2018 after he was arrested for shoplifting. He said he planned to sue the city for $30 million, but for now his lawyer said that he's been down on his luck and homeless, sleeping on subway trains because he didn't feel safe in shelters due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The NYPD told NBC New York that they are aware of the use of force in the incident, and are reviewing the matter."	right

WASHINGTON, D.C.—In a move to make purchasing congresspeople easier and faster for lobbyists, Congress voted to approve a new measure that calls for congresspeople to wear barcodes on their foreheads so lobbyists, activists, and corporations can simply scan them and self-checkout.

Self-checkout machines will be installed at all exits of the Capitol Building, so once they've added congresspeople to their cart, lobbyists can pay right on the way out.

""Purchasing congresspeople used to be a time-consuming, expensive process,"" said a Planned Parenthood representative. ""Now, we can simply walk through Congress, scan all the congresspeople that are for sale, and checkout without having to interact with any humans.""

""We hate humans---like, a lot,"" the PP rep added.

One major military-industrial complex lobby group, Americans For Bigger Bombs, said they are also in support of the new move.

""When you need to make a quick pit stop at our nation's legislative body to purchase a few congresspeople to start a new war, you need to do it fast,"" said one AFBB lawyer. ""An attack on Iran can't wait while you wheel and deal, wine and dine, and negotiate endlessly. Now, I can just scan and go.""

ho46ye	libertarian	U.S. Supreme Court rules against Trump bid to conceal financial records from prosecutor, a sitting President cannot evade criminal investigations	"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday firmly rejected President Donald Trump’s arguments for sweeping presidential immunity and ruled that a New York prosecutor can obtain his financial records but prevented - at least for now - Democratic-led House of Representatives committees from getting similar documents.

The twin 7-2 rulings authored by conservative Chief Justice John Roberts mark another milestone in Trump’s tumultuous presidency and in the short term prevent details of his finances from becoming public because lower courts must resolve lingering issues.

The businessman-turned politician, seeking re-election on Nov. 3, has fought tenaciously to keep his tax returns and other elements of his finances secret - and the rulings spare him of any major revelation at a sensitive time. But looking further ahead, Trump faces possible future criminal prosecution in his native New York, perhaps after he leaves office.

The Supreme Court emphasized that there are limits to the powers of the presidency and stoutly reaffirmed the principle that not even the president is above the law - a message delivered 3-1/2 years into a presidency in which Trump has repeatedly skirted the norms of American political conduct.

Trump’s two Supreme Court appointees, conservatives Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, joined Roberts and the four liberal justices in both rulings, spurning Trump’s arguments that the Constitution gave him absolute immunity from any criminal proceedings as a sitting president.

Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, a Democrat, and the three House committees all issued subpoenas to third parties for the records, not to the Republican president himself. Trump sued to block enforcement of the subpoenas.

The court in the New York case ruled that the subpoena to Trump’s long-term accounting firm, Mazars LLP, for tax returns and other financial records to be turned over to a grand jury as part of Vance’s criminal investigation can be enforced.

The justices rebuffed Trump’s broad arguments on expansive presidential powers in a showdown with Congress as he tried to block subpoenas by lawmakers to Mazars and two banks - Deutsche Bank and Capital One - for his financial records. In doing so, the court also faulted the broad arguments made by the House and sent the litigation back to lower courts, delaying the final outcome.

Trump portrayed himself as a victim, calling the subpoenas a “pure witch hunt” and a “hoax” in comments to reporters. On Twitter, he wrote, “This is all a political prosecution ... and now I have to keep fighting in a politically corrupt New York. Not fair to this Presidency or Administration!”

Trump’s argument that he was immune from any criminal process “runs up against the 200 years of precedent establishing that Presidents, and their official communications, are subject to judicial process,” Roberts wrote.

“We affirm that principle today and hold that the president is neither absolutely immune from state criminal subpoenas seeking his private papers nor entitled to a heightened standard of need,” Roberts added.

Roberts rejected the suggestion that the decision would subject future presidents to harassment by local prosecutors, noting that the court in 1997 rejected a similar argument made by President Bill Clinton when he faced a civil lawsuit brought by a woman who accused him of making unwanted sexual advances - litigation the court refused to delay.

The court in 1974, Roberts noted, also ruled that President Richard Nixon must turn over audio tapes in the Watergate scandal that eventually drove him to resign.

‘HE IS HIDING’

Unlike other recent presidents, Trump has refused to release his tax returns and other documents that could provide details on his wealth and the activities of his family real-estate company, the Trump Organization.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats will continue to investigate Trump and seek to enforce the subpoenas.

Slideshow ( 4 images )

“Congress’s constitutional responsibility to uncover the truth continues, specifically related to the President’s Russia connection that he is hiding,” Pelosi said, referring to the possibility that Trump’s financial records could show such an entanglement.

Roberts said lawmakers will need to further explain the need for the records at the lower court, which would then assess the burden placed on the president.

Jay Sekulow, Trump’s personal lawyer, said he would “raise additional constitutional and legal issues in the lower courts.”

Vance’s investigation into Trump and the Trump Organization was spurred by disclosures of hush payments to two women who said they had past sexual relationships with the president, pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal - relationships he has denied.

Trump argued that Congress lacked a valid purpose for seeking his records and that such disclosure would compromise his and his family’s privacy and distract him from his duties. In the Vance investigation, Trump’s lawyers argued before a lower court that law enforcement officials would not have the power to investigate him even if he shot someone on New York’s Fifth Avenue.

The House Oversight Committee issued its subpoenas after Michael Cohen, his former lawyer, told Congress Trump had inflated and deflated certain assets on financial statements between 2011 and 2013 in part to reduce his real estate taxes.

The House Financial Services Committee is examining possible money laundering in U.S. property deals involving Trump. The House Intelligence Committee is investigating whether Trump’s dealings left him vulnerable to the influence of foreign individuals or governments.

k8grel	libertarian	After Condemning Georgia's Election System As Untrustworthy, Trump Urges Republicans There to Vote in Senate Runoffs	"For weeks Donald Trump has been insisting that Joe Biden stole the presidential election through a massive fraud that gave the Democratic nominee an edge in several battleground states. Those states include Georgia, where the results certified on November 20 gave Biden a lead of about 12,700 votes. Notwithstanding his argument that Georgia's election system is fundamentally corrupt and untrustworthy, Trump wants Republicans there to vote in two runoff elections next month that will decide party control of the Senate.

The contradiction between those two messages came to a comical head on Saturday, when the president told his supporters in Georgia to ignore pro-Trump lawyers who have suggested that voting in the January 5 Senate runoffs would be futile. ""Friends of mine say we are not going to vote because we are angry about the presidential election,"" Trump said at a rally in Valdosta, Georgia. ""Don't listen to my friends.""

One of the friends to whom Trump referred was L. Lin Wood Jr., an Atlanta attorney who agrees that Trump actually won the election. ""Why would you go back and vote in another rigged election?"" Wood asked at a rally last Wednesday.

Wood filed an unsuccessful lawsuit that sought to block certification of the election results in Georgia. ""Because Georgia has already certified its results, Wood's requests to delay certification and commence a new recount are moot,"" the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit ruled on Saturday. The court, in a unanimous decision by a three-judge panel, also found that Wood did not have standing to sue, saying ""he fails to allege a particularized injury."" It added that ""we may not entertain post-election contests about garden-variety issues of vote counting and misconduct that may properly be filed in state courts.""

The same day that Trump spoke, Wood told Republicans there was no need to participate in the elections that will determine whether Republicans David Perdue, elected in 2014, and Kelly Loeffler, appointed by Gov. Brian Kemp to replace an ailing Johnny Isakson in 2019, will continue to represent Georgia in the Senate. ""We do NOT need to vote for @KLoeffler & @sendavidperdue in rigged runoff to control Senate,"" Wood tweeted. ""We The People demand only lawful votes be counted. Trump won by a landslide!"" Wood explained that even if both candidates lost, Republicans would still control the Senate. ""With @realDonaldTrump as President,"" he said, ""the Vice-President will cast any necessary tie-breaking in U.S. Senate.""

Wood's advice was entirely consistent with Trump's view, according to which Georgia Republicans cannot be confident that their votes will be counted. It was also consistent with Trump's argument that he will prevail in demonstrating that he actually won a second term, which means Vice President Mike Pence will be in a position to resolve any tie votes in the Senate.

Urging Georgia Republicans to disregard Wood, Trump implied that votes in the Senate runoffs would be accurately counted. ""There's never been a case where a state has had this prominence [in] Senate races,"" he said. ""This is something that's very important, and you have to get out and you have to vote. If you don't vote, the socialists and the communists win.""

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has lent credence to the president's claims of systematic fraud in this year's election, likewise is annoyed at Wood and former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell, who posits a vast international conspiracy that enabled Biden to claim a false victory. Kemp and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger have warned that Powell's lawsuit challenging their state's election procedures could jeopardize a timely resolution of the Senate races. ""Lin Wood and Sidney Powell are totally destructive,"" Gingrich, who represented Georgia's 6th Congressional District until 1999, tweeted last Thursday. ""Every Georgia conservative who cares about America MUST vote in the runoff. Their [don't] vote strategy will cripple America.""

Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel, who has vocally supported the Trump campaign's post-election lawsuits, is also worried that all the talk of rigged vote counts will deter Republicans from participating in Georgia's runoffs. ""This is the key—it's not decided,"" McDaniel told Trump supporters in Marietta, Georgia, on Saturday. ""So if you lose your faith and you don't vote and people walk away—that will decide it.""

Even while urging Republicans to vote, Trump strayed from that message to reiterate his claim that Biden's victory in Georgia was phony. ""This election was rigged, and we can't let it happen to two of the greatest, most respected people in Washington,"" Trump said, referring to Perdue and Loeffler. The Democrats ""cheated, and they rigged our presidential election,"" he added. ""But we will still win it."" Yet the method that Trump recommended for ensuring the two senators' victories—i.e., voting for them—was the very same method he says was unavailing in the presidential election, thanks to Democratic chicanery that, by his account, still has not been corrected in Georgia.

Although Kemp and Raffensperger are both Trump supporters, the president says ""the election apparatus in Georgia is run by Democrats,"" even while faulting the Republicans who are actually in charge for failing to prevent or reverse the fraud that supposedly led to Biden's victory in Georgia. Perdue and Loeffler, meanwhile, have demanded that Raffensperger resign for failing to keep elections free and fair in Georgia.

Like Trump's warnings against voting by mail, these charges have had the entirely predictable result of discouraging Republicans from voting. Why take the trouble of casting a ballot if you have no confidence that it will be counted? If the upshot is that Republicans lose control of the Senate, that will be bad news for those of us who think divided government would help curb some of Biden's worst instincts. The silver lining is that it will be a richly deserved comeuppance for Trump and all the Republicans who have recklessly indulged his post-election fantasies."	right

lms0oo	libertarian	AZ House criminal justice committee UNANIMOUSLY passes HB2810 which requires law enforcement to get a criminal conviction BEFORE taking someone's property under civil asset forfeiture	"February 18, 2021

By Jenna Bentley

Today, the Goldwater Institute’s reform of civil asset forfeiture in Arizona took an important step forward when its legislation (HB 2810, sponsored by Rep. Travis Grantham) passed the House Criminal Justice Reform Committee with unanimous support. This long-overdue bill states that law enforcement must obtain a conviction before the government can take your property, along with other critical safeguards.

Civil asset forfeiture allows police and prosecutors in states across the country to take, keep, and profit from someone’s property without even charging them with a crime—much less convicting them of one. Originally created to fight organized crime, civil forfeiture is now mostly used against single individuals for small amounts of money or property. Half of all currency forfeitures in Arizona are for less than $1,000. In Arizona, you do not need be charged with a crime for your property to be taken forever. Even worse, innocent owners have to prove that their property wasn’t involved in criminal activity in order to get it back, which is a difficult feat.

Fortunately, HB 2810 will help protect the rights of Arizonans by:

Requiring law enforcement obtain a criminal conviction before forfeiting property under civil asset forfeiture—better protecting innocent owners while still allowing them to stop criminal activity;

Shifting the burden of proof to show the property was being used in connection to illegal activity instead of having an innocent owner prove that it was not;

Improving notice requirements by law enforcement when property is taken, such as leaving a receipt at the location of sized property if owner is not present;

Eliminating non-judicial forfeiture and creating a post-deprivation hearing process to help ensure a person’s rights are protected; and

Preventing the use of “roadside waivers” that coerce people into giving up their rights.

Reforms to civil asset forfeiture laws have garnered bipartisan support nationally. In a recent study, Arizona scored a D- for our poor citizen protections in this practice. HB 2810 creates additional safeguards for innocent Arizonans while still allowing law enforcement to stop those who are profiting from their criminal activities.

HB 2810 is soon headed to the House floor. Requiring a criminal conviction before forfeiture is a commonsense reform that will help protect Arizonans’ property and due process rights, while allowing law enforcement to stop those who are profiting from criminal activity.

"With the militarization of local police forces on full display as heavily armed cops and armored vehicles patrol the streets and crack down on protests over the killing of George Floyd, Sen.

President Donald Trump in 2017 rolled back Obama-era limits on the 1033 Program, which authorizes the Defense Department to send military equipment and weapons to local police departments. As NBC reported at the time, ""Congress created the program in 1990 during the height of the war on drugs for federal and state law enforcement agencies, and it was expanded seven years later to include all law enforcement departments.""

""Since the program's inception,"" NBC noted, ""more than $5.4 billion in equipment has flowed to police.""

The response by local law enforcement to the nationwide uprising that followed Floyd's killing has heightened scrutiny of the 1033 Program, with lawmakers and activists warning that access to military hardware has made police behavior toward protesters even more brutal and violent.

""Militarizing local police forces doesn't make our communities safer,"" tweeted Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.

Philip McHarris, a PhD candidate in sociology and African American studies at Yale University, wrote in an op-ed for the Washington Post last week that ""police departments have come to resemble military units, contributing to deadly violence disproportionately against black Americans.""

""The cycle of police brutality sparking unrest, and that unrest being met by the militarized police is increasingly familiar in modern American society,"" wrote McHarris. ""Tough-on-crime policies and militarized police departments have paved the way for increased police contact and tragic violence. Reducing the capacity for police to engage in routine and militaristic violence is the only way to break recurring cycles of police killings and the militarized response that protests of them are often met with."""	right

llejnq	libertarian	More Republicans blame Biden for Capitol riot than fault Trump	"Former President Donald Trump is already being rehabilitated in Republicans' minds.

In the days after hundreds of Trump's supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol building, the outgoing president's approval rating was at an all-time low. Republicans who once indicated they'd support him in 2024 were pulling away. A good fifth of his own party supported impeachment, and even more blamed him for the attack.

But more than a month and an impeachment acquittal later, that has changed, a Morning Consult/Politico poll out Tuesday reveals. While just 42 percent of Republicans said they'd support Trump in a potential 2024 run just days after the riot, 54 percent said this past weekend they'd back him again — the same proportion that supported Trump in the weeks after the 2020 election.

Republicans have also shifted the blame for the Capitol riot over the past few weeks. While 47 percent of the GOP said Trump was at least partly responsible for the riot when asked Jan. 6–7, just 27 percent said so when asked Feb. 14–15. Now, 46 percent of those Republican respondents actually blamed President Biden and 58 percent blamed Democrats in Congress. Just 27 percent blamed Republicans in Congress — many of whom had challenged the Jan. 6 electoral college vote certification.

Even before this poll was released, Trump's allies saw his reputation was back on the rise, and were amazed at just how quickly it was happening.

Marijuana is already legal in 11 states.

The vote would be the first taken by either chamber of Congress to take marijuana off the Controlled Substances Act.

Cannabis is currently listed as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act, meaning there’s a high chance for abuse and no medical benefits. Removing it under the act would eliminate the federal prohibition on the drug but leave in place state laws making it illegal.

It would also expunge criminal records and provide grant funding for people who have been negatively impacted by enforcement of marijuana laws.

Gov. Mike Parson said he spoke to Trump Tuesday and was reassured that the president-- who previously has retweeted a photo of the couple, Mark and Patricia McCloskey holding up guns in front of their house in the June 28 incident--""understands the situation in Missouri.""

""He understands the situation in St. Louis and how out of control it is for a prosecutor to let violent criminals off and not do their job and try to attack law-abiding citizens,"" Parson said at a press conference.

""The conversation I had with the President, said that he would do everything he could within his powers to help with this situation,"" Parson added.

Parson and Trump's conversation comes days after police served a search warrant at the McCloskey's home in the upscale Central West End neighborhood of St. Louis, in the same area where the city's Democratic mayor, Lyda Krewson, lives.

Nearly 500 protesters marching for racial equality and against police brutality were headed towards Krewson's residence during the June 28 incident, after she read off the names and addresses of individuals petitioning to defund the police. Mark and Patricia McCloskey came out of their house, brandished their guns, and demanded the protesters leave because they were trespassing. The couple later told Fox News' Sean Hannity that they were fearful that the protesters would ""kill us"" and ""burn down the house.""

Police seized the rifle that Mark was holding in the now-viral video of the incident, while a handgun that Patricia was holding was turned over to St. Louis Police Saturday by the couple's attorney Albert Watkins. The handgun had been in Watkins's possession as evidence that it was inoperable when she pointed it at protesters ""in defense of themselves and their home at [the] time of the march,"" Watkins told Fox News. https://www.foxnews.com/us/trump-st-louis-couple-wielding-guns-protesters-missouri-governor

Watkins says he anticipates state charges against the couple ""as early as today,"" he told Fox News on Wednesday, but views Trump's interest in the case as a positive.

""The President has been restrained to date and has been kept up to date in virtually real time,"" Watkins told Fox News. ""His support behind the scenes was vital to permitting local police to step back from prior directives to be 'hands off' protesters.

""The support of the Executive Office appears to have motivated The Governor to garner a heightened degree of appreciation for implications and rights at risk in this situation,"" Watkins said.

Parson shared an article about the McCloskeys on Facebook Tuesday with the caption ""Missourians have the right to protect their homes.""

In a separate post, Parson lambasted city prosecutors, saying it's ""appalling"" that they are ""targeting the McCloskey's for defending their home.""

Meanwhile, St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner's office released a statement calling it ""unbelievable the Governor of the state of Missouri would seek advice from one of the most divisive leaders in our generation to overpower the discretion of a locally elected prosecutor.""

""Today, both the Governor and Donald Trump came after me for doing my job and investigating a case,"" the statement said on Tuesday. ""While they continue to play politics with the handling of this matter, spreading misinformation and distorting the truth, I refuse to do so. As I always do, I am reviewing all the available facts and the law and will apply them equally, regardless of the people involved.""

i01wqa	libertarian	‘Patently Unconstitutional’: Portland Judges Are Barring Arrestees From Attending Public Protests As A Condition of Release	"In a move that legal experts say is “patently unconstitutional,” federal authorities in Portland are arresting people for minor offenses and then barring them from attending any future protests as a condition of their release, ProPublica reported Tuesday. According to the report, at least 12 people arrested in connection with the demonstrations were expressly prohibited from being present at any future public demonstrations as they await their days in court.

In one instance, the conditions of release issued by the U.S. District Court in Oregon for a defendant whose offense was “fail[ing] to comply with the lawful direction of federal police officers” stated that “Defendant may not attend any other protests, rallies, assemblies or public gatherings in the state of Oregon.”

The order further stated that any violation of the conditions of release may result in “the immediate issuance of a warrant for your arrest, a revocation of release, an order of detention, forfeiture of bond, and a prosecution for contempt of court and could result in a term of imprisonment, a fine, or both.”

According to the report, in several instances where the aforementioned conditions of release were not available at the time of a detainee’s release, Magistrate Judge John V. Acosta added the provision by hand.

Magistrate Judge Jolie A. Russo similarly added a handwritten protest ban provision to at least three of the 15 release orders she signed Monday.

Constitutional law experts were quick to call out the orders as direct violations of the First Amendment.

Senior staff attorney at the American Civil liberties Union (ACLU) Somil Trivedi told ProPublica that release conditions generally concern whether a defendant poses a risk of flight or threat to public safety.

“This is neither,” he said, calling the protest ban “sort of hilariously unconstitutional.”

Attorney Cristian Farias of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University compared the unconstitutionality of the provision to the one in the case of Donald Trump’s former attorney and fixer Michael Cohen.

“This was blatantly unconstitutional when they tried it on Michael Cohen, who was convicted of multiple felonies,” Farias wrote. “It’s even more so when the people being restrained from exercising First Amendment rights are merely facing accusations that may not stand up in court.”

j7c3zu	libertarian	Trump saying he won’t join the next debate since it’s virtual. Let’s get Jo to debate Joe!	"Trump expressed indignation at the unexpected change of format — which neither he nor Biden had been consulted about — and insisted that he was prepared to take the debate stage despite still battling Covid-19 from the confines of the White House.

“I’m not going to waste my time on a virtual debate. That’s not what debating is all about,” Trump said in an interview with Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business. “You sit behind a computer and do a debate. It’s ridiculous, and then they cut you off whenever they want.”

The president’s outright rejection of the new terms came shortly after the nonpartisan debate commission revealed Thursday morning that the town hall on Oct. 15 would feature the two candidates beaming in “from separate remote locations.”

The town hall’s participants and moderator Steve Scully of C-SPAN will be positioned as planned at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts in Miami, the commission said.

Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien, who has himself tested positive for Covid-19, quickly reaffirmed the president’s position in a statement Thursday, saying Trump will “pass on this sad excuse to bail out Joe Biden and do a rally instead.”

Stepien predicted Trump “will have posted multiple negative tests prior to the debate,” and argued that the “safety of all involved can easily be achieved without canceling a chance for voters to see both candidates go head to head.”

Trump’s physician, Sean Conley, said in a memo released Thursday evening that the president had completed his therapy and that he expected Trump to be able to participate in public engagements as of Saturday.

Stepien then released a statement saying there was “therefore no medical reason why the Commission on Presidential Debates should shift the debate to a virtual setting, postpone it, or otherwise alter it in any way.”

Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield initially suggested Thursday morning that the Democratic nominee would take part in the virtual event, saying Biden “looks forward to speaking directly to the American people.”

But later Thursday morning, Bedingfield said in a longer statement that while Biden “was prepared to accept the CPD’s proposal for a virtual” debate, Trump “clearly does not want to face questions from the voters” on the pandemic and the economy.

Bedingfield said Biden will instead “find an appropriate place to take questions from voters directly” on Oct. 15, and she urged the commission to reschedule the town hall for Oct. 22 — the date of the third debate — so Trump “is not able to evade accountability.”

Stepien retorted less than an hour later, agreeing with Bedingfield’s plan to move the town hall to Oct. 22 — as long as the previously scheduled third debate also was shifted back one week to Oct. 29, just five days from Election Day.

Bedingfield rebuffed Stepien’s altered timetable in yet another statement. “Donald Trump doesn’t make the debate schedule,” she said, noting that the dates for the three forums have been set since last June.

The president’s “erratic behavior does not allow him to rewrite the calendar, and pick new dates of his choosing,” Bedingfield said.

Amid the tit-for-tat between the two campaign chiefs, Biden posited that it was still possible Trump would show up because “he changes his mind every second.”

“We don’t know what the president’s going to do,” Biden told reporters in Delaware, adding that he was “going to follow the commission recommendations.”

If Trump opts to hold a rally instead, “I don’t know what I’ll do,” Biden said.

By Thursday afternoon, however, ABC News had announced plans to host its own town hall on Oct. 15 featuring Biden.

When asked on CNN why Biden would not use the commission’s town hall that had already been planned, Bedingfield replied: “Because Donald Trump isn’t going to show.”

“If Donald Trump isn’t going to be there, then we’re going to use the opportunity to talk directly to the American people,” she said.

Frank Fahrenkopf, the commission’s co-founder and Republican co-chair, told POLITICO on Thursday that “of course” the decision to conduct a virtual debate “has to do with the question of whether or not [Trump] might still be contagious.”

There is no requirement for a candidate to participate in a presidential debate, Fahrenkopf said, citing President Jimmy Carter’s refusal to take part in the first forum of the 1980 election.

Fahrenkopf also emphasized that there was “no consultation” with the Trump or Biden campaigns regarding the decision to have the candidates debate remotely.

“We let them know minutes before,” he said, adding: “We’re doing it for health reasons and safety reasons. Period. End.”

Even if Trump presents the commission with a negative Covid-19 test, the debate is not likely to proceed in-person, Fahrenkopf indicated.

“You’re going to have people say, ‘Well, yes, he’s clear. He can go.’ Then have other people say, ‘Well, that’s not long enough. He still may be shedding,’” Fahrenkopf said. “I don’t know. We’re going to rely on medical advice.”

Fahrenkopf told The Associated Press late Thursday that there was no way the commission would make the second debate in-person, no matter Trump’s protests.

Trump said Thursday he did not think he was “contagious at all,” describing himself as feeling “perfect” and “essentially very clean.”

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people who have tested positive for Covid-19 isolate for at least 10 days, and perhaps longer if they still have symptoms.

Conley reported in a memo Wednesday that Trump had been “symptom-free for over 24 hours.”

But the White House has not provided evidence that Trump is not contagious, and 10 days have not elapsed since his diagnosis was announced last Friday.

The White House also has refused to provide a definitive timeline of the president’s Covid-19 tests in the days leading up to his diagnosis, and the current condition of his lungs has not been disclosed.

Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel, who also is infected, said Thursday that if the president tests negative in the days before Oct. 15, “then this should be an in-person debate.”

McDaniel said voters deserve to hear the candidates spar in-person with a “gloves-off approach,” and claimed without evidence that Biden would use a teleprompter during the debate.

“This is not good for our country right now,” she told Fox News.

Former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a top Biden surrogate, said it was “too bad” Trump was declining to debate, because “the more the American people can hear two candidates side by side — even if it’s virtual — the better.”

Buttigieg also told Fox News that he did not know why Trump “would want to be in a room with other people if you were contagious with a deadly disease,” adding that “maybe the president doesn’t care about other people.”

Trump had previously signaled that he intended to take part in the debate despite his diagnosis, tweeting Tuesday that he was “looking forward” to the forum on Oct. 15 and that it “will be great!”

Trump’s top aides and advisers also expressed hope in recent days that the president would be able to attend.

Biden said Monday that he would be willing to participate in the debate “if scientists say that it’s safe,” but advised that “we should be very cautious” in organizing the event.

On Tuesday, however, Biden concluded that “we shouldn’t have a debate” if Trump remains infected.

The commission had already been exploring alternative formats for the Oct. 15 debate in the aftermath of the first clash between Trump and Biden — which saw the president repeatedly interrupt his opponent and moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News.

The commission said last week that the first debate demonstrated the need for “additional structure” in the format of the remaining forums to “ensure a more orderly discussion.”

The latest announcement from the commission Thursday infuriated the president’s advisers, who said they were blindsided.

The Trump campaign already was rankled by the commission’s handling of the vice presidential debate Wednesday night and its decision to erect plexiglass barriers between incumbent Mike Pence and Biden’s running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris.

Trump’s team objected to the move, saying it was medically unnecessary because it would do little to prevent coronavirus transmission.

The reelection effort held a conference call with reporters last week during which they accused the commission — which has been producing presidential debates for decades and has long had a reputation for being a neutral arbiter — of acting as partisan outfit bent on helping Biden.

The campaign was angered by the commission reassessing the need for more structure at future debates, and complained that Wallace showed bias toward the former vice president.

Should Trump decide to attend, next week’s forum would not be the first to feature presidential candidates debating from separate locations.

John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon met remotely for their third debate in 1960, with the Democratic Massachusetts senator stationed in New York and the Republican vice president broadcasting from Los Angeles.

Still, it is not immediately clear what effects the virtual nature of the debate will have on the 90-minutes of prime-time programming.

The format change could facilitate the implementation of additional measures to enforce rules governing debate speaking time that some Democrats and media commentators have demanded over the past week.

hysuj3	libertarian	President Trump signs executive order allowing importation of prescription drugs from other countries	"President Trump signed four executive orders on Friday that aim to lower prescription drug prices, seeking to add to his healthcare reform credentials amid sagging approval ratings.

“They represent the most far-reaching prescription drug reforms ever issued by a president, nothing even close,” Trump said in a press briefing on Friday.

The orders would have to be translated into official rules by agencies and are not likely to be in place before the election. Still, Trump portrayed the signing as a blow for seniors against pharmaceutical companies and foreign freeloaders.

The first of four orders will mandate discounts on insulin for hospitals to be passed down to patients.

Story continues below

“These providers should not be receiving discounts for themselves while charging their poorest patients massive, full prices. Under this order, the price of insulin for affected patients will come down to just pennies a day from numbers that you weren't even able to think about. It's a massive cost savings,” Trump said.

Trump will also allow cheaper versions of the same prescription drugs to be imported from Canada, a proposal that drug companies have rebuked.

The Trump administration first released a proposal to import inexpensive drugs in July 2019. The proposal, the Safe Importation Action Plan, called for rulemaking to authorize state, wholesaler, or pharmacy plans to try to set up drug importation programs that abide by Food and Drug Administration safety standards. The FDA would also work with manufacturers to assure that drugs sold to foreign countries abide by FDA regulations to be sold in the United States.

The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a powerful drug lobbying group, has opposed drug importation, citing potential health risks to American consumers. The Canadian government has also rejected importation proposals, saying importation would deplete the country's own supply of prescription drugs.

Trump also revived a 2019 rule that never came to fruition after pushback from pharmacy benefit managers, which negotiate drug prices with insurers. The proposed rule would require PBMs in Medicare Part D to pass discounts negotiated with insurers directly to the patients using those drugs, allowing Medicare beneficiaries to save money on medications.

Trump said Friday that his new executive order would cut out the “middlemen"" and ""middlewomen” and directed Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to “complete the rule-making process he commenced.”

Just as they did in 2019, pharmacy benefit managers are expected to retaliate. The PBM sector has planned an ad campaign to oppose any effort to eliminate rebates and play it as a political mistake that could raise drug costs for the elderly in swing states ahead of the November election, Politico reported.

“The middlemen are making a fortune, and pharmacy benefit managers and people are just bilking Medicare patients with these high drug prices while they pocket gigantic discounts, gigantic discounts,” he said.

The president will also implement a mandate that pharmaceutical companies sell prescription drugs in the U.S. at the same prices as in other countries, called the international drug-pricing index or the “favored nations clause.” Trump has long decried what he calls a ""global freeloading"" system in which drug companies are able to offer their products at a lower cost to other countries by charging the U.S. more. He first proposed the initiative in July 2019.

“It also means that the U.S. taxpayers are effectively subsidizing the socialist healthcare systems of foreign welfare states and many other countries,” Trump said. “We will end that abuse and restore the principles of free enterprise. ... This has to do with common sense and courage, to be honest.”

Trump said he’ll be meeting with executives from the pharmaceutical industry Tuesday to discuss ways to lower drug prices and out-of-pocket expenses. He added that if the talks are “successful,” the fourth executive order could be scrapped."	right

ii1vfr	libertarian	Rand Paul harassed by protesters in D.C. demanding he say Breonna Taylor's name, seeming to be totally unaware that Rand has introduced the Justice for Breonna Taylor Act to end no-knock warrants	"Black Lives Matter demonstrators surrounded Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) and several women for several minutes on the streets of Washington, D.C. early Friday morning as he attempted to leave the Republican National Convention event at the White House.

Paul was among the guests at President Donald Trump’s speech on the South Lawn of the White House accepting his party’s nomination. Protesters attempted to drown out the speech, and later harassed people leaving the event.

Paul and his companions were prevented from moving for several minutes, and were surrounded by police — as well as by protesters screaming at them, demanding that they say the name of Breonna Taylor, who was killed by police in Louisville earlier this year.

The Senator and the others stood silently for several minutes, wearing masks.

Some held signs that read “Good Trouble,” “Stop Killing Us,” and “Black Lives Matter.” One of the sign-holders raised a middle finger.

“It’s Rand Paul, and he won’t say Breonna Taylor’s name!” one shouted.

“You can’t acknowledge Breonna Taylor ever existed! That’s disgusting!” another yelled.

This tweet, and the corresponding AP article, make no mention of the fact that Rand Paul is the co-sponse of the ""Justice for Breonna Taylor Act” 2 months ago which prohibits no-knock raids, which he came to after ""talking with Breonna Taylor’s family""https://t.co/biACbNpLAR https://t.co/dsHC5mRNQ6 — Steve Krakauer (@SteveKrak) August 28, 2020

D.C. Metropolitan Police eventually formed a phalanx around Paul and moved through the crowd slowly, some carrying bicycles. Paul and the women traveling with him linked arms to avoid being separated from one another by the unruly demonstrators, who continued to shout at the Senator.

Paul later tweeted:

Ron Paul's page. ""While there were never any restrictions on Ron Paul's page, we restricted one admin's ability to post by mistake. We have corrected the error,"" the spokesman said.

On Monday, Facebook blocked former presidential candidate Ron Paul from his own page. The move came hours after the longtime congressman and libertarian hero shared an article he wrote criticizing Twitter and Facebook for banning President Donald Trump from their platforms.

“Last week’s massive social media purges – starting with President Trump’s permanent ban from Twitter and other outlets – was shocking and chilling, particularly to those of us who value free expression and the free exchange of ideas,” Paul wrote. “The justifications given for the silencing of wide swaths of public opinion made no sense and the process was anything but transparent. Nowhere in President Trump’s two ‘offending’ Tweets, for example, was a call for violence expressed explicitly or implicitly. It was a classic example of sentence first, verdict later.”

Paul shared the article on Facebook sometime around 10 a.m. EST. Hours later, on Twitter, Paul said he had been blocked by Facebook.

“With no explanation other than ‘repeatedly going against our community standards,’ Facebook has blocked me from managing my page,” Paul announced on Twitter. “Never have we received notice of violating community standards in the past and nowhere is the offending post identified.”

Paul said the only material posted to Facebook on Monday was the article previously noted, his weekly ""Texas Straight Talk"" column, which he has published every week since 1976.

The Big Chill on Speech

The question of social media censorship, a phenomenon that has grown steadily in recent years, is a thorny issue, especially for libertarians.

As private companies, Twitter and Facebook have the legal right to decide who and what to allow on their platform. On the other hand, many see the cultural values of free expression and viewpoint diversity as the cornerstones of a liberal (in the classical sense) and tolerant society.

For years, the media generally and libertarians particularly discussed how bans on controversial figures should be handled. The debate began in earnest in the summer of 2016 following the ban of Milo Yiannopoulos, a right-leaning provocateur who had gained an immense following on social media.

Many at the time were shocked to see Yiannopoulos banned following a spat with actress Leslie Jones, but there was general agreement in many circles that Twitter, while wrong on principle, was within its rights.

“Twitter is a private company. It can set its own speech policies, and those policies don't have to be fair. There's no universal human right to own a Twitter account,” Reason’s Robby Soave pointed out. “But if Twitter wants to live up to its stated commitment to maintaining a public forum where provocative, controversial, and even occasionally rude or hurtful speech is tolerated, then it should consider restoring Yiannopoulos's profile.”

Two years later, a similar conversation took place with Alex Jones, the far-right radio show host and conspiracy theorist, who ultimately found himself banned by Twitter and Facebook. The responses were not surprising.

Many left-leaning pundits cheered the move, pointing out Jones was not entitled to First Amendment protection, since Twitter and Facebook were private companies.

“This move is an important step toward setting reasonable, and badly needed, precedent around free speech,” wrote Washington Post columnist Christine Emba. “Companies don’t have to defend the indefensible. Alex Jones can do that all on his own.”

The right, however, warned the bans were unlikely to end with Jones.

“Next they’re coming for you,” Jesse Kelly wrote in The Federalist. “Their goal is to silence dissenting voices. Look down at where you’re standing at this very moment. That is where you draw your line in the sand. Do not give them another inch.”

The Slippery Slope of Restricting Speech

The censorship was never going to end with Alex Jones and Milo Yiannopoulos, of course. Still, the eagerness with which Big Tech is silencing dissent might have surprised even those who warned it would not end with Jones.

Banning the president of the United States was shocking. Taking action against Ron Paul is horrifying. It is senseless. Paul is a man of principle and peace. He is 85 and not active in politics. Paul does not incite violence and is a threat to no one.

How did we go from banning Alex Jones to taking action against Ron Paul in the space of two years? The answer is not hard to find. It lies in a principle abandoned.

“Once you start making exceptions to a universal principle/general rule, you begin to undermine it; it becomes easier to make further exceptions,” FEE’s Dan Sanchez pointed out in 2017. “If the hate speech of Nazis are to be restricted, why not the hate speech of traditionalist conservatives? If the violent, seditious rhetoric of Nazis are too dangerous to allow, why should the violent, seditious rhetoric of communists be tolerated, or any fundamental criticism of the government?”

Indeed. Of course, Twitter and Facebook have long since abandoned the notion they are free speech platforms. They openly state it’s their mission to keep users “safe,” which they do by enforcing “rules” and community standards when and how they choose.

This mission was flawed to begin with. (I don’t need Facebook or Twitter to protect me from ideas or discussion, thank you very much, and I suspect most individuals would offer similar sentiments.) But by booting Ron Paul, it becomes clear that “safety” is not the true goal of Big Tech. I suspect it never was.

Paul’s deplatforming should anger and perhaps even frighten us. The widespread silencing of dissent is a serious matter; there’s no denying that. And matters are further complicated by the fact that Amazon, Google, and Apple have taken steps that will hinder social media platforms competing with Facebook and Twitter.

But what should be done?

As it happens, Paul himself asked this very question in the column that apparently led to his Facebook exile.

“So what is to be done? Even pro-free speech alternative social media outlets are under attack from the Big Tech/government Leviathan. There are no easy solutions. But we must think back to the dissidents in the era of Soviet tyranny,” Paul wrote.

He continued:

“They had no Internet. They had no social media. They had no ability to communicate with thousands and millions of like-minded, freedom lovers. Yet they used incredible creativity in the face of incredible adversity to continue pushing their ideas. Because no army – not even Big Tech partnered with Big Government - can stop an idea whose time has come. And Liberty is that idea. We must move forward with creativity and confidence!”

Liberty is indeed the idea. And if we’re patient, I suspect the market will soon offer a genuine alternative (more on that later) that may soon make Facebook and Twitter regret their authoritarian impulses."	right
giqzl1	libertarian	Plainclothes cops perform no-knock raid on the wrong house. Owner shot 8 times. Boyfriend fires back once and gets booked for attempted murder of an officer.	"A decorated Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) was repeatedly shot and killed in her own home by Louisville police officers.

According to a report by The Washington Post, Breonna Taylor, 26, was shot at least eight times by police officers in her apartment on 13 March, a lawsuit filed by her family claims.

Officials have said that police were executing a drug warrant, according to the lawsuit.

The family is seeking reprimand for the killing in the lawsuit, accusing officers of wrongful death, excessive force and gross negligence.

“Not one person has talked to me. Not one person has explained anything to me,” Tamika Palmer, Ms Taylor’s mother said in an interview.

“I want justice for her. I want them to say her name. There’s no reason Breonna should be dead at all.”

Police were allegedly searching the complex for a man who did not reside there. The lawsuit reportedly states that the suspect had already been detained earlier that day when officers visited Ms Taylor's apartment.

The aspiring nurse's boyfriend Kenneth Walker was inside the apartment with her when police purportedly attempted to enter without announcement. Mr Walker, who is a licenced gun owner, is said to have fired shots at officers when they attempted to enter.

None of the officers involved have been charged in connection with the shooting. Mr Walker was arrested following the incident and faces charges of first-degree assault and attempted murder of a police officer.

Louisville Metro Police Department spokeswoman Jessie Halladay declined to comment on the case when contacted by The Post.

“There is an ongoing public integrity investigation into this case and therefore it would be inappropriate for us to comment at this time,” she said in a statement.

According to the report, the couple believed that someone was attempting to break into their apartment.

Ms Taylor had been working as an EMT in Louisville amidst the coronavirus pandemic as an essential worker, helping to save lives during the public health crisis.

Recommended Two men arrested over fatal shooting of black jogger in Georgia

“She was an essential worker. She had to go to work,” Ms Taylor's mother, Tamika Palmer said in an interview with the 19th according to The Post.

“She didn’t have a problem with that. … To not be able to sleep in her own bed without someone busting down her door and taking her life. … I was just like, ‘Make sure you wash your hands!’ ”

Attorney Ben Crump, who is representing the family of Ahmaud Arbery, has been hired to assist Ms Taylor's family in the lawsuit.

Arbery was killed while he was unarmed during a jog in his neighbourhood. Two Americans, a father, and son have recently been arrested and charged with the murder or Arbery.

The action was only taken to charge Gregory and Travis McMichael when the shooting was covered in national media and provoked outrage.

“They’re killing our sisters just like they’re killing our brothers, but for whatever reason, we have not given our sisters the same attention that we have given to Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Stephon Clark, Terence Crutcher, Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, Eric Garner, Laquan McDonald,” Mr Crump told the newspaper.

“Breonna’s name should be known by everybody in America who said those other names, because she was in her own home, doing absolutely nothing wrong.”"	right
hefkkz	libertarian	'I don't kid': Trump contradicts aides and insists he meant it when he asked for coronavirus testing to be slowed down	"Donald Trump – yet again – contradicted some of his closest aides who claimed the president made a comment ""in jest"" during a weekend campaign rally that he asked them to slow coronavirus testing.

""I don't kid,"" Mr Trump told reporters Tuesday as he left the White House for a trip to Arizona, again calling Covid-19 testing a ""double-edged sword"" because more testing reveals more positive cases. Public health experts, including a list that work for Mr Trump's White House, say testing is critical to locating and isolating the virus.

Talking over the loud hum of Marine One on the White House's South Lawn, the president used Tuesday morning edition of ""Chopper Talk"" to suggest he is mostly concerned about keeping the number of confirmed cases and deaths from Covid-19 low.

One way to do that, by definition, is to test less. People would still be sick with the coronavirus, or even die, but they would not join either list.

His South Lawn anti-testing rant was a repeat of a tweet he sent just before 7 a.m.

""Cases are going up in the U.S. because we are testing far more than any other country, and ever expanding. With smaller testing we would show fewer cases!"" he wrote.

But that is a much different message than White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany sent just a day before.

""No, he has not,"" Ms McEnany said when asked if Mr Trump had indeed, as he said at a Tusla rally, directed his aides to slow testing. ""Any suggestion that testing has been slowed is not rooted in fact.""

Mr Trump was ""joking"" and criticising the media for not reporting that the United States leads the world in testing, she added. (That is a false statement, however.)

The press secretary got a chance to clarify her own statement the next day.

""I've talked to the president about testing a lot today. He has made it abundantly clear that he appreciates testing, that we have tested more Americans than any other country has tested in their respective countries in the world. But what he was making was a serious point, and that's why he said, 'I don't kid.' He was noting he was making a serious point, but he was using sarcasm to do that at the rally,"" she told reporters on Air Force One.

""And the serious point he was making is that when you test more people, you identify more cases. But that shouldn't be, the cases should not be indicative of the progress we've made,"" Ms McEnany added Tuesday. ""What's indicative of the progress we've made is the fact that, per capita, we have fewer fatalities than Europe by a large margin. So that's the point he was making on testing. But make no mistake: The president appreciates testing and is very proud of the great work that we've done.""

But Mr Trump told supporters Saturday night in Oklahoma that he had given an order to slow testing.

""Then, I closed it down to Europe early, closed it down because I saw what was happening. And by the way, most people said, don't do it, don't do it. We saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like we're terrible. And what we've done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment and with testing – you know, testing is a double edged sword,"" he said.

""We've tested now 25 million people. It's probably 20 million people more than anybody else. Germany's done a lot, South Korea's done a lot. They call me, they say the job you're doing – here's the bad part, when you test of – when you do testing to that extent, you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases,"" Mr Trump said. ""So, I said to my people slow the testing down, please. They test and they test."""	right
jsmkib	libertarian	Dead ‘voter’ cited in Trump lawsuit never cast ballot, Michigan records show	"LANSING — Republican President Donald Trump's new federal lawsuit seeking to delay certification of Michigan election results includes a false claim that a dead person cast a ballot, according to the Department of State.

The complaint, which alleges dozens of improprieties during absentee ballot counting in Detroit, includes an affidavit from Anita Chase of Warren, who claimed she reviewed state records showing her deceased son had cast ballots in 2016 and 2020.

It’s the only assertion of a dead voter in the lawsuit, which was announced Tuesday and officially filed Wednesday in federal court. The Trump campaign submitted affidavits from more than 100 Detroit election challengers, claiming they were denied a “meaningful opportunity” to review ballot tabulation.

Rather than a dead voter, though, it appears to be a case of mistaken identity caused by confusion over ""common names,"" said Tracy Wimmer, a spokesperson for Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson's office.

The voter registration for a Mark D. Chase, who was listed as living at the same Warren address as his mother, was cancelled in 2016, according to state records, which show he last voted in 2014 and was born in 1978.

That birthday aligns with an online obituary for Chase, who died in July 2016.

There are two other Mark D. Chase listings in the state's Qualified Voter File. Both were born in different years than Anita Chase's son and live in different parts of the state: There is a Mark D. Chase is Ottawa County who is an active voter, and a Mark D. Chase in Barry County who has no recent voting history, Wimmer said.

Bridge was not immediately able to contact Anita Chase. In her affidavit, Chase said her son would be 42 years old if he were alive. A recent copy of the Qualified Voter File reviewed by Bridge did not include any listings for a Mark D. Chase born in 1978.

As Bridge reported Tuesday, Trump’s campaign and supporters have made unsubstantiated claims that Democrats want to count ballots from deceased voters in Michigan, where challenger Joe Biden defeated the president by nearly 150,000 votes, according to unofficial results.

But none of the claims from Trump supporters has panned out so far, including internet and social media posts about Michigan voters who are very much alive.

Donna Brydges, one of the voters alleged to be dead, was alive and playing cribbage with her husband in their home near Ludington last week. Another, June Aiken of Napoleon Township, is “alive and well” too — “quite well, in fact,” according to police who check on her. Same goes for William Bradley of Detroit, whose father of the same name died decades ago.

Like many false fraud claims that have spread online in the last week, officials said those accusations were triggered by a series of isolated data input errors by some of Michigan's 1,603 local and county election clerks.

Bradley was confused with his father of the same name. The Qualified Voter File mistakenly listed the 75-year-old Brydges as 119 years old. Aiken's birthday was listed in the Qualified Voter File as 1900 instead of 1926, and an online obituary suggested a woman with the same name had died.

But Napoleon Township police investigated the claim and spoke with Aiken to confirm she is alive, Deputy Police Chief Matt Peters told Bridge. “There's no evidence at this point of any fraud or any intent to defraud the system at all."""	right
k6l60i	libertarian	The U.S. Spent $11.6B to Stop Cocaine Trafficking. It Was a Massive Failure: Conservatives spent billions to try and stop it and only made the cocaine industry stronger, the conservatives got addicted to coke themselves, and their accomplishment was killing innocent Colombians.	"MEDELLÍN, Colombia - A new report authored by former members of President Barack Obama’s administration says that the U.S’ decades-old anti-narcotics foreign policy is a “failure.”

“While Plan Colombia was a counterinsurgency success, it was a counternarcotics failure,” says the report, which was released this week by U.S. Representative Eliot L. Engel, chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.

“Now even counterinsurgency gains are receding as armed groups step up attacks on civilians.”

The report heightens hopes from those lobbying for a change to the status quo of the drug war for the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden to reform U.S. drug policy abroad.

Two former Latin America foreign policy advisers who served when Biden was vice president - Juan Gonzalez and Dan Restrepo - are the co-authors of the investigation.

The U.S. Congressional Committee on Foreign Affairs is set to review its long-standing bipartisan policy on Colombia’s drug and crime challenges just as Biden chooses key members of his Cabinet. His choice for senior adviser to Latin American affairs is still unclear, but it’s likely that the views reflected in the special report will be shared by members of his Latin America policy team.

“Our collective failure to control either drug abuse or drug trafficking has exacted an enormous human toll,” the report says. “In Latin America, increasing substance abuse combined with drug-related homicides have ruined many more lives. The illicit drug industry has evolved far more rapidly than our efforts to contain it.”

Since the early 2000s, the U.S. pumped around $11.6 billion into Colombia under a policy dubbed “Plan Colombia.” It was an effort to choke off cocaine shipments destined for the United States’ consumer market and crack down on rebel groups, insurgencies and a mishmash of organized crime outfits who profited from the trade, whose violent tactics threatened stability in the region. At one point in the late 1990s, Colombia was thought to be on the brink of collapsing into a failed state.

“Plan Colombia against insurgents [such as the FARC] was successful but the policy failed on anti-drugs policy. That’s the paradox,” said Sandra Borda, a professor of international relations at Colombia’s University of the Andes.

Indeed, one outcome of Plan Colombia was the weakening of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). After beating them back militarily, Colombia’s government opened up a peace process that in 2016 saw the demobilization of around 8,000 fighters. Ex-combatants are currently going through a fragile and flawed process of reintegration.

Homicide levels in Colombia have decreased dramatically, falling from around 70 per 100,000 inhabitants in the early 2000s to 25 per 100,000 in 2018. But according to some estimates, both coca cultivation and coca production continue to increase.

“We’ve been going 40 years with a policy that costs billions of U.S. dollars with zero success and so much cost and destruction. Let’s try out another policy,” says Iván Marulanda, a Colombian senator who proposes to legalize the coca leaf and cocaine and create a government-run industry.

Few nations in Latin America have progressive drug policies, although the legalization of cannabis in some shape or form is increasing. Those countries that have tried other options to U.S.-backed militarized drug wars, such as that seen in Mexico, are few and far between, and some have been ostracized as a result.

In Bolivia, for example, a legal coca scheme has radically reduced drug-related violence - yet the U.S. has long considered the country to have “failed demonstrably to make sufficient efforts to meet its obligations under international counternarcotics agreements.”

Some of those who spent their careers in U.S. counternarcotics operations think it’s time for a change. “That really irks our counterparts because here we are legalizing drugs in the U.S. And yet we have the audacity to be sanctioning other countries if they’re not doing enough on counterdrug efforts. That’s always been counterproductive. And yet we continue to do it. It’s based on hypocrisy: Do as we say, not as we do here in the United States,” said Mike Vigil, the former chief of international operations at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), who spent nearly two decades working Mexico.

Change from the status quo on drug policy is apparently what U.S. voters want too. Those who opted for Biden and his Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are hopeful that they will push to decriminalize cannabis at a federal level and accommodate states like Oregon that are beginning to decriminalize hard drugs like heroin and meth."	right

The sign in support of the Democratic running mates was vandalized

A Pennsylvania man’s sign showing support for Presidential candidate Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris was shot at six times over the weekend.

“I was shocked and astonished because I didn’t think anyone in my area would be this way. Then it turned to anger,” Erin Blaisure said to Eyewitness News 3.

He told the publication that there is a myriad of signs for Trump on the road that he lives on, but his sign is one of the few supporting Biden and Harris.

“There’s people with Trump signs up and down this dirt road. I’m the only one that has a Biden [sign]. I should be able to have and vote for any political sign on my property,” said Blaisure.

He says he didn’t see who fired the shots but they were very close to the area his horses graze in. He said he was worried because the commotion could have scared the horses causing them to break the gate and try to escape.

Kamala Harris (D-CA) on October 2, 2020 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Harris is campaigning ahead of the October 7 debate against U.S. Vice President Mike Pence in Salt Lake City, Utah.

The horses were not injured and state troopers say because they didn’t find any bullet casings so it will be harder to track down a suspect. Blaisure says he has a feeling about who the culprit is.

“I live in a small town, and I live a mile down a dirt road, so, to me, it has to be someone who lives around here,” said Blaisure.

As troopers continue to investigate, Blaisure says his sign will remain out front.

kqybnr	libertarian	Officers with an FBI task force showed up at the home of a Michigan state senator’s chief of staff and aggressively questioned her about a draft bill she had discussed on a private legislative Zoom call. The bill would limit the use of tear gas by police against protesters.	"Two officers with an FBI task force showed up at the home of a Michigan state senator’s chief of staff and aggressively questioned her about a draft bill she had discussed on a private legislative Zoom call. The bill would limit the use of tear gas by police against protesters. The incident happened in Southfield, a suburb north of Detroit, on October 29, days before the presidential election and less than a month after the FBI had foiled a terror plot by far-right violent extremists to kidnap Michigan’s Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and seize control of the Capitol building. The men, an FBI special agent and a local police officer assigned to the task force, knocked on the door of Katie Reiter, chief of staff to state Sen. Rosemary Bayer, a Democrat. They told her that they had received a “report” about an online conversation she had participated in from her home 10 days earlier, in which she had discussed “the use of tear gas during the election,” Reiter told The Intercept. They then pressed her to answer questions about the bill’s substance and timing even after she had told them what her job was and repeatedly warned that the content of the draft legislation was confidential. “He was very unpleasant,” Reiter said of the special agent, who stood close to her without wearing a mask and combatively asked questions while refusing to answer hers. “I said, ‘Well, you know who I work for, right? And what I do for a living?’” she recalled. “Because I figured they would have Googled before they came to my house. He said, ‘No, we have no idea who you are.’”

Reiter had discussed the proposed ban on tear gas on a private 90-minute Zoom call with Bayer and a handful of other staffers on October 19, part of a package of proposed legislation drafted in response to the George Floyd protests last summer. She believes she might have discussed the election as well, possibly strategizing about whether to introduce the draft bill before or after the November vote. But the conversation was a routine work call — and the FBI’s visit and insistent questioning raised alarming questions about how and why the legislative discussion warranted police scrutiny. While Reiter says the two officers refused to answer any questions about how they became aware of her private meeting, she noted that an appliance repairman was in a nearby room at the time of the call and might have overheard the conversation and alerted the authorities. “I don’t think it can be ruled out,” she said. A spokesperson for the FBI declined to comment on the record, as did a spokesperson for Zoom. Regardless of how the FBI came to know of the call, civil rights advocates argued it was highly inappropriate for the agents to interrogate an elected official’s aide about legislative matters. Mike German, a former FBI special agent and fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice’s liberty and national security program, noted that there are severe restrictions on the FBI’s political activities, including any investigative effort that might impact an election or legislation. “Certainly if there was any intention to intimidate staffers in their deliberations about legislation, that would be highly problematic,” he told The Intercept. “And the police officers or task force officers should have recognized that as soon as the witness said that she was a staffer discussing legislation.” German also noted that the incident was indicative of a long-standing problem with the FBI’s war on terror-era policy to investigate every tip it receives, no matter how implausible or far-fetched — an effort that he says wastes resources while putting civil liberties at risk and hindering the FBI’s ability to pursue the most credible threats. “For our safety, we put fire alarms in every building, but we also make it against the law to pull them if there isn’t a fire, because we recognize that responding to false alarms dulls the response time,” he said. “And yet the security apparatus we’ve created post-9/11 creates a massive amount of false alarms.”

False Alarms Reiter had been in bed when she was woken up by loud pounding on her door and voices yelling “Police!” at around 8 a.m. She threw on a bathrobe and answered the door, where two plainclothes officers first identified themselves as police and then as FBI. Reiter did not recognize their badges, so she went inside to get dressed and called her sister, who lives nearby, her husband, father, and local police, whom she asked to come over. “I didn’t really know if these were FBI agents or not,” she told The Intercept. “I was afraid to open my door.” When Southfield police arrived at the home and confirmed the agents were indeed with the FBI, Reiter asked them to stay. (She later obtained a police report, shared with The Intercept, confirming that police remained on the scene, at a distance, for the duration of the FBI’s visit. The agents claimed they had been at Reiter’s home a day earlier but found no one there, which she says is unlikely as her husband was working from home that day.) Over the next 10 minutes, they then grilled Reiter, skeptically pressing her about her Zoom conversation and pushing back against her answers as if they didn’t believe her. When she told them about the proposed legislation, they insisted on knowing what it would say, whether it would be formally introduced, and when. When she repeated that this information was confidential business of the state legislature, the agent who had been conducting most of the questioning told her it would have to go in his report, she said. “Once I said who I was and who I worked for, and moreover, what the meeting was about, the interrogation should have ended,” Reiter told The Intercept. “If they didn’t believe me about the tear gas legislation, they could have easily asked to talk with the senator rather than continue to question me. … It certainly didn’t take that much time for me to tell them who I was and what the Zoom meeting was about. The rest of the questioning was focused on the legislation. To this day, I don’t know why.” Before the officers left, and at Reiter’s insistence, one of them gave her his business card. The other officer, who said he had no card with him, scribbled his name in the back. The men were Jeff Whipple, a police officer with the Birmingham Police Department and member of the FBI’s financial crimes task force for metro Detroit, and FBI Special Agent Dave Jacobs. The FBI runs dozens of task forces across the country, in which agents from the bureau partner with a host of local and state police agencies to tackle a variety of law enforcement issues, from financial crimes to terrorism. It’s unclear why an investigation into remarks about the use of tear gas would have fallen under the aegis of this particular task force, which typically pursues fraud and other financial crimes. The presence of local police on FBI task forces, particularly joint terrorism task forces or JTTFs, has long been a controversial issue. Some cities have pulled their officers from these partnerships because the civil rights protections the FBI is required to observe are more lenient compared to those of local police departments. And there have been problematic instances of FBI task forces inappropriately intervening in local political matters. In 2012, for instance, members of a Nevada JTTF aggressively interrogated Native American residents and others who had spoken at a public town hall in opposition to bear hunting, German said. In the Michigan case, it was notable that local police officers on an FBI task force would seek to investigate legislation that would restrict their own departments’ ability to use tear gas against protesters. “I would imagine that with any sort of legislative effort to restrict the use of tear gas by police officers, local police would have an interest in that legislation,” said German. “It certainly raises questions.” Reached by phone, Whipple declined to comment, while Jacobs did not return a request for comment. A spokesperson for the Birmingham Police Department, Whipple’s employer, wrote in an email to The Intercept that the officer is assigned full time to the task force and referred questions to the FBI. “The incident you are referring to is a federal matter,” the spokesperson wrote.

Fear and Intimidation Following the FBI’s visit, Reiter filed a public records request with the city of Southfield seeking more information about the encounter. City officials denied most of her request. One document she received cited a number of exemptions to public records laws, including one indicating that fulfilling her request might help “identify or provide means of identifying an informant.” State Sen. Rosemary Bayer, who worked as a software engineer before being elected in 2019, was disturbed by the FBI’s visit to her staffer and alarmed about how the bureau might have learned about the subject of their Zoom call. Bayer said that her immediate concern was whether “they hacked into the meeting,” she told The Intercept, or whether the visit was intended “to cause fear and intimidation.” “The whole thing feels political, like they were either trying to intimidate a Democratic office before the election or intimidate people working on the side of Black Lives Matter,” she later wrote in an email. “It all feels so Iron Curtain (or maybe J. Edgar Hoover) — men pounding on the door in the dark hours of the morning, incorrectly identifying themselves, purposely intimidating people just to scare them. To keep them from — protesting? Teaching about implicit bias?” There isn’t any evidence that Zoom provided the FBI or any other law enforcement agency with information about the October virtual meeting, or that any such law enforcement agency somehow has real-time access to the contents of meetings on the platform. But regardless of how the FBI task force learned about the Zoom call, the incident offers a jarring reminder that the degree of privacy and confidentiality afforded by in-person meetings is impossible to achieve through streaming video calls.

jwpv5i	libertarian	Alaska becomes second state to approve ranked-choice voting as Ballot Measure 2 passes by 1%	"Alaska voters have approved a ballot measure that will make Alaska the second state in the nation to use ranked-choice voting in statewide elections.

With an estimated 99.9% of votes counted statewide, Ballot Measure 2 has received the support of 50.55% of Alaska’s voters, according to results posted Tuesday night by the Alaska Division of Elections. Vote counting will finish Wednesday but is not expected to change the final result. Election officials will spend one week double-checking the result before certifying the election Nov. 25.

“This is a victory for all Alaskans regardless of their political leaning,” said Shea Siegert, campaign manager of the group that supported Ballot Measure 2.

“We now have an electoral system that lives up to Alaska’s independent streak by saying ‘to hell with politics, let’s do what is right for Alaska,'” he said in a prepared statement, referring to a line often attributed to former U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens.

Starting with the 2022 election, the measure will merge the state’s two primary elections into one, and the top four vote-getters regardless of political party will advance to the general election. Some states have so-called “top two” primaries. Alaska will be the only state with a “top four” primary.

In the general election, voters will be asked to rank the four candidates in order of preference. Maine already uses that system. Ranked-choice voting would apply to legislative races, and all statewide races, including governor, U.S. Senate and U.S. House. The 2024 presidential race will also be ranked-choice but is not subject to the top-four primary.

The measure does not apply to city and borough elections.

A provision intended to fight “dark money” will require greater financial disclosure by groups giving money to candidates in state legislative races and in the governor’s race.

The measure would take effect before the 2022 election if Alaska needs a special election to fill a vacant office.

Brett Huber, campaign manager of the leading vote-no group, said his team “had a short amount of time and a lot less money, and we tried our best.”

Ballot Measure 2 supporters spent nearly $7 million and campaigned for a year and a half ahead of the election. Opponents raised less than 10% of that total and started formal opposition in fall 2020. (Separate groups, including the Alaska Policy Forum, conducted campaigns against ranked-choice voting before that.)

“This is a huge change, and I don’t think people have wrapped their mind around how big a change this is yet,” Huber said.

Opponents and proponents expect the measure will face legal challenges. The Alaska Legislature could also amend some aspects.

Scott Kendall, an attorney who wrote much of the measure, said backers intend to work through the 2022 election on an educational campaign to inform Alaskans about the changes and to prepare them for the new-look voting system.

Ballot Measure 2 trailed on Election Day, but by smaller margins than Democratic candidates and progressive independents. As absentee, questioned and early votes were counted in subsequent days, “yes” overtook “no”.

In Massachusetts, a statewide ranked-choice measure was defeated by a wide margin. Huber said the difference in Alaska was the “dark money"" provision, which was popular and advertised heavily by supporters.

Kendall said he thinks Alaskans' reputation for independence was the difference."	right

jkuqjq	libertarian	So the government can break into your house and sue you for defending yourself?	"An officer involved in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor has filed a civil suit against the 26-year-old's boyfriend for emotional distress, assault and battery on the night she was killed. The lawsuit claims Louisville Sergeant Jonathan Mattingly experienced ""severe trauma, mental anguish, and emotional distress"" because of Kenneth Walker's actions on March 13.

Mattingly and two other officers entered Taylor's apartment early in the morning that day with a warrant in an attempt to carry out a drug investigation. Walker, a licensed gun owner who said he thought the officers were intruders, allegedly fired a shot that hit Mattingly in the leg. Police opened fire, killing Taylor. Taylor had no criminal record and no drugs were found.

""Walker's conduct in shooting Mattingly is outrageous, intolerable, and offends all accepted standards of decency and morality,"" the lawsuit said, citing one of the legal standards for intentional emotional distress.

Walker was initially arrested and charged with attempted murder over the shooting, but those charges were later dropped. Walker subsequently sued the Louisville Metropolitan Police Department and also sought immunity based on the state's ""Stand Your Ground"" law.

Walker's attorney called Mattingly's lawsuit a ""baseless attempt to further victimize and harass Kenny.""

""Kenny Walker is protected by law under KRS 503.085 and is immune from both criminal prosecution and civil liability as he was acting in self defense in his own home,"" attorney Steve Romines said in a statement obtained by CBS News.

""Even the most basic understanding of Kentucky's 'Stand Your Ground' law and the 'Castle Doctrine' evidences this fact. One would think that breaking into the apartment, executing his girlfriend and framing him for a crime in an effort to cover up her murder would be enough for them,"" he added. ""Yet this baseless attempt to further victimize and harass Kenny indicates otherwise.""

In a statement obtained by CBS News, Mattingly's attorney Kent Wicker voiced his support for his client. ""Mattingly was shot and nearly killed by Kenneth Walker. He's entitled to, and should, use the legal process to seek a remedy for the injury that Walker has caused him,"" Wicker said.

Taylor's death sparked widespread protests and demands that the officers involved face accountability.

Dozens showed up in pouring rain and bitter cold Thursday night for a ""Say her name"" march, reports CBS Louisville affiliate WLKY-TV. ""Until we get some justice, there will be no celebration. There's no time for leisure, there's no time for recreation,"" said Aaron Jordan, one of the organizers.

A grand jury indicted one officer in relation to shooting a neighboring apartment, but no officers were charged directly for their role in Taylor's death. Recently, two grand jurors have come forward to accuse Attorney General Daniel Cameron of misrepresenting their position on potential indictments and not presenting them with the full range of potential charges."	right

j1dd2u	libertarian	Libertarian Jo Jorgensen has never smoked pot, but she would still defend your right to do it in her long shot bid for president	"click to enlarge Courtesy photo

Dr. Jo Jorgensen.

In the Libertarian Party, presidential candidates don’t pick their running mates; instead, they’re chosen by delegates at the nominating convention in a separate vote. This year’s presidential ticket resulted in the odd-couple pairing of Dr. Jo Jorgensen, an academic from South Carolina, and Jeremy “Spike” Cohen, a podcaster prankster who promises “a Waffle House on every corner” and to fund time travel research to kill baby Adolf Hitler.“All I can say is that I was the one who was nominated for president,” Jorgensen says, diplomatically, when asked about her running mate’s more out-there ideas. “And so I’m not campaigning on any of those things. I do have a different platform, and so that’s the one that I’m pushing.”caught up with her before a campaign stop in Detroit.That platform is that “government is too big, too bossy, too nosy, and too intrusive,” Jorgensen says. “And the worst part is they usually end up hurting the very people they try to help.”In a political system where Democrats and Republicans dominate, third-party candidates like Jorgensen, who made a campaign stop in Detroit on Monday, have their work cut out for them — and especially this year, with the coronavirus pandemic, civil unrest in the streets, and the all-consuming contest between President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden, which has been cast as no less than a battle between authoritarianism and democracy, the top issues of the day. Earlier this year, U.S. Rep. Justin Amash of Grand Rapids briefly considered seeking the Libertarian Party nomination after defecting from the Republican Party and becoming the lone Libertarian in Congress, but backed out after just three weeks, citing the “extraordinary challenges” of 2020.Jorgensen, however, remains undeterred.“The path of course is very difficult, but I still say somebody has to run,” Jorgensen says. “We have to get the word out there. And so many people are realizing that the two parties just aren’t working.”Four years ago, the Libertarian Party ran a high-profile ticket featuring two former Republican governors, Gary Johnson of New Mexico and William Weld of Massachusetts. It wound up being the Libertarian Party’s most successful presidential run to date, earning nearly 4.5 million votes nationally. (For perspective, Trump and Clinton received more than 60 million votes each, while the Green Party’s Jill Stein earned just 1.4 million votes.) The Libertarians did so well in Michigan in 2016 that the party qualified to hold a primary in the 2018 governor’s race — the first time that a third party did so in almost 50 years.The margin between Trump and Clinton was just some 10,000 votes in Michigan, meaning that third-party voters got plenty of blame for helping Trump win. Even Bill Gelineau — who helped campaign for Johnson in 2016 and won Michigan’s Libertarian Party gubernatorial nomination in 2018, where he came in a distant third — told us earlier this year that he was going to put his party aside and vote for Biden in November. “It’s not because I don’t believe in the party — I worked my ass off for people in the Libertarian Party — but the fact that Michigan is going to be a critical state,” he says. “I believe that Trump is a clear and present danger.” (Amash, meanwhile, has endorsed Jorgensen.)Still, Jorgensen thinks there’s an appetite for a third choice this year, claiming that most of her campaign’s volunteers have come from outside the party. Trump, she says, appealed to many because he was an outsider who promised to cut spending, balance the budget, and bring our troops home. “And he did none of that,” she says. “And so what I would like to say is that for all the people who wanted a true outsider, I’m that outsider. I think people do deserve a choice, and right now they don’t have much of a choice between Trump and Biden.”Of course, plenty of Biden supporters will say there is a clear choice, and point to Trump’s move to fill the Supreme Court seat vacated by the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg as proof that liberal third-party voters should have just pinched their noses and voted for Clinton; even if you don’t love a particular candidate, you have to look at the four-dimensional chessboard. But Jorgensen believes the Democratic Party deserves to be critiqued.“The Democratic Party that I grew up learning about in the ’60s was against the war, and they were for free speech, and they basically thought that people should be making their own decisions,” she says. “And that's not the party of today. The party today is very pro-war. And of course they don't believe in free speech.” Jorgensen says she wants to “turn America into one giant Switzerland, armed and neutral.”She also points to the Democratic Party’s slow, reluctant acceptance of gay marriage as an example of a lack of leadership and principles; they accepted it only once the popular culture did. “Both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama said that gay marriage should be illegal,” she says. “I don't for a minute think that they agreed with that, but they're just going after the votes. They're not standing up for what's right.” Another issue that she thinks that the Libertarian Party has long been ahead of both major parties is the right to use marijuana — neither Trump nor Biden have come out strong in support of cannabis, despite the fact that the majority of states have legalized it, and most voters support it. (Green Party candidate Howie Hawkins also supports legalizing weed .)So has Jorgensen ever smoked pot — and did she inhale?That gets a laugh out of the self-described “goody-two-shoes.” (“The nice thing about me running for president is I have no dirt,” she says.) “I somehow managed to get through high school and college in the 1970s without ever having tried marijuana,” she says, adding that she got a graduate certificate in drug and addiction studies. “What I do is I tell people that my drug of choice is bourbon, which is actually more dangerous than marijuana. I tell people that the only way marijuana kills you is if a bale of it falls on your head. However, I think that we should be able to be free to use whatever drugs we choose. And so I choose to use the more dangerous drug of bourbon.”Nevertheless, Jorgensen says she would remove marijuana from the federal list of controlled substances on her first day in office.“I've had a lot of people say, ‘Well, I don't use drugs, so I don't care about the drug issue,’” she says. The problems associated with drugs — violence, crime — “aren’t drug problems; those are prohibition problems,” she says, adding that cannabis is a safer alternative for pain relief than the opiates to which so many Americans have become addicted.We admit, it almost feels silly to be asking about pot in the middle of a pandemic that has completely upended life around the world. But Jorgensen believes there is a Libertarian solution to the pandemic, as well: She says Trump could have used his emergency powers to streamline the FDA and approve more COVID-19 tests; then, the U.S. could have avoided much of the long economic shutdowns by implementing a large government-run mass testing program, as other countries have done.Regarding the Black Lives Matter protests against police brutality, Jorgensen agrees that the problem is institutionalized racism, a problem made worse by the federal government militarizing police departments with weapons and tanks. “Instead of having the kind of community with the beat cop who knows everybody's name, now instead what you have is kind of an us-versus-them mentality,” she says.“If you look at, for instance, Rosa Parks, the heroic Black woman who refused to sit on the back of the bus, a lot of people don't realize that was a government-run, government-owned bus,” Jorgensen says. “And 60% of the bus ridership at the time were Blacks. What if Uber were to discriminate against 60% of their customers? They would go out of business, as well they should. But the government doesn't go out of business — the government can discriminate without any accountability, just like with Jim Crow laws, just like with redlining, So we’ve got the government who has basically set up this broken system.”Despite the Libertarians’ gains in 2016, we’re not sure 2020 is the year to make the case for a smaller government and a free market, with the push for reopening the economy making the U.S. the top coronavirus hotspot in the entire world. So we have to ask: Knowing that the Libertarian Party faces a long shot, does Jorgensen have a preference as to who will win — Trump or Biden?“Not really,” she says. “Because both of them want to spend our money. Both of them want to make decisions for us. Neither one wants to bring the troops home.”"	right
ggmqsm	libertarian	Trump Livid After California Allows Statewide Mail-In Voting: ‘These Votes Must Not Count’	"California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) issued an executive order on Friday allowing all voters in the state to vote by mail in the upcoming November elections to protect them from exposure to COVID-19 at polling sites.

Now a furious President Donald Trump is demanding that the votes in the deeply Democratic state be thrown out.

“So in California, the Democrats, who fought like crazy to get all mail in only ballots, and succeeded, have just opened a voting booth in the most Democrat area in the State,” he tweeted on Saturday. “They are trying to steal another election.”

“It’s all rigged out there,” Trump also wrote. “These votes must not count. SCAM!”

On the previous day, Newsom ordered all California county elections officials to send registered voters mail-in ballots for the elections on November 3 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The Golden State is the first in the country to do so.

“Elections and the right to vote are foundational to our democracy,” the governor stated in a press release. “No Californian should be forced to risk their health in order to exercise their right to vote.”

Newsom said in-person voting will still be available, and that California legislators are currently working on a plan to operate polling sites safely.

Trump often rails against statewide voting by mail–even though it would protect voters from the coronavirus outbreak and make it easier to vote in general–because it “doesn’t work out well for Republicans.”

“Republicans should fight very hard when it comes to state wide mail-in voting,” he tweeted in April."	right
gybggu	libertarian	Rep. Justin Amash Wants To End Qualified Immunity. Where Are the Republicans?	"Rep. Justin Amash (L–Mich.) wants to end qualified immunity.

The insidious legal doctrine allows police officers to violate your civil rights with absolute impunity if those rights have not been spelled out with near-identical precision in preexisting case law. Theoretically, it protects public officials from bogus civil suits, but practically it often allows egregious misconduct.

George Floyd's death at the hands of former Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin forced new life into the debate, shining light on a doctrine that many people say has contributed to an environment of police abuse. Amash announced late Sunday that he would introduce the End Qualified Immunity Act, with Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D–Mass.) signing on as a cosponsor Thursday.

""It is the sense of the Congress that we must correct the erroneous interpretation of section 1983 which provides for qualified immunity,"" the bill reads, ""and reiterate the standard found on the face of the statute, which does not limit liability on the basis of the defendant's good faith beliefs or on the basis that the right was not 'clearly established' at the time of the violation.""

That ""clearly established"" bit is what's most important, as the standard has become increasingly impossible to meet. Two cops in Fresno, California, were afforded qualified immunity after allegedly stealing $225,000 while executing a search warrant because it had not been ""clearly established"" in case law that stealing is wrong. An officer with the Los Angeles Police Department was given qualified immunity after shooting, without warning, an unarmed 15-year-old boy who was on his way to school, because the boy's friend was holding a plastic airsoft gun replica. A sheriff's deputy in Coffee County, Georgia, received qualified immunity after shooting a 10-year-old boy while aiming at a nonthreatening dog. The list, unfortunately, goes on.

The courts' decisions in those cases mean that each appellant had no legal recourse to seek compensation for lost assets or medical bills.

As of Friday, 16 additional legislators had signed on to Amash's proposal. Not a single one of them is a Republican.

The dissonance is mind-boggling: The GOP claims to be the party of small government and freedom, and they now have the opportunity to squash a dangerous doctrine that has put deadly power in the hands of the state at the expense of the little guy.

Republicans rightly criticize public sector monopolies that inevitably hurt the people the government is supposed to serve. Take teachers unions, for instance, which the GOP has historically railed against for propping up teachers at the expense of students. They're not wrong: Unions wield enormous political power that can be weaponized to skirt responsibility and accountability.

But why, then, are they so slow to apply that very same logic to the institutions emboldening the police?

""In case after case, police unions have defended deadly misdeeds committed by law enforcement,"" writes Reason's Peter Suderman. Consider the case of Eric Garner, who died in 2014 after New York City Police Department (NYPD) officer Daniel Pantaleo placed him in a chokehold for selling loose cigarettes. ""I can't breathe"" were his last words, captured on video.

Pantaleo was fired after a police administrative judge ruled that he had violated official NYPD protocol. Although the officer broke those rules with fatal consequences, the union chose not to cast Pantaleo as an outlier—a cop who never should have been one—but instead chose to continue defending him.

As Suderman notes, ""Patrick Lynch, the president of the Police Benevolent Association, Pantaleo's union, criticized the city for giving in to 'anti-police extremists' and warned that such decisions threatened the ability of city police to do their jobs,"" as if all officers need to reserve the right to use excessive, forbidden amounts of force.

That police unions have taken that road shouldn't be surprising. But it also reminds us why it's time for them to go, since they enable behavior that threatens the very people they are supposedly protecting and serving.

So, too, is the story with qualified immunity—a doctrine that has allowed a collection of rogue cops to throw civil rights to the wind without any fear of comeuppance. Shielding the police from accountability at all costs does not advance freedom. When it comes to qualified immunity, where are the Republicans?"	right
ld76kn	libertarian	Don't Let the Capitol Riot Become an Excuse for Expanding Government Power	"Many of my fellow libertarians were rightly in a tizzy after former CIA director John Brennan, commenting on the right-wing insurrectionists who stormed the Capitol, noted that the Biden administration is ""now moving in laser-like fashion to try to uncover as much as they can about what looks very similar to insurgency movements that we've seen overseas.""

In particular, they were dismayed by his description of an ""unholy alliance…of religious extremists, authoritarians, fascists, bigots, racists, nativists—even libertarians."" Brennan's former deputy chief of staff clarified the ""even libertarians"" comments to Politifact—noting that, ""many self-identified libertarians acknowledged their participation in the disgraceful events of 6 January.""

The big concern isn't the cheap swipe at libertarians, some of whom probably deserve it. Instead, the fear is that Brennan's words provide a template for the ""mission creep"" that accompanies every government effort to battle some growing threat.

Let's dispense with the obvious. The attack on the Capitol was an outrage. The federal government should prosecute those people who committed acts of vandalism or violence. Congress and voters have every right to inflict a political price on elected officials who fanned the flames of the insurgents. Homegrown radicalism is indeed a serious problem.

However, we should be leery about giving the feds additional powers. ""The trouble with fighting for human freedom is that one spends most of one's time defending scoundrels,"" wrote Baltimore's famed journalist H.L. Mencken. ""For it is against scoundrels that oppressive laws are first aimed, and oppression must be stopped at the beginning if it is to be stopped at all.""

Or as former Rep. Justin Amash (L–Mich.), who was the first member of Congress from the Libertarian Party, tweeted in opposition to a new domestic-terrorism bill: ""There are too many federal criminal laws already. Terrorists can be charged under multiple statutes. Laws passed in the heat of the moment, like the Patriot Act, are routinely applied nefariously against law-abiding Americans."" Read that last sentence aloud for effect.

On April 19, 1995, Timothy McVeigh detonated a fertilizer bomb in a van at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, which killed 168 people in the nation's deadliest terror incident before 9/11. That date marked the second anniversary of the federal siege of the Branch Davidian complex in Waco, Texas—an event that radicalized McVeigh and his accomplices.

At the time, a militia movement was gaining steam. The Oklahoma City atrocity spurred Congress to pass the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. As is often the case with these ""in the heat of the moment"" proposals, this measure passed with strong bipartisan support in Congress. President Bill Clinton signed it into law.

The law meant to ""deter terrorism, provide justice for victims, provide for an effective death penalty, and for other purposes,"" but mainly gutted the right to habeas corpus. Scholars call that constitutional protection the ""Great Writ of Liberty"" because it provides a process for wrongly imprisoned people to challenge their detention in court.

Fast forward to Oct. 26, 2001, when President George W. Bush signed the USA Patriot Act—a bipartisan effort to protect the country after the September 11 attacks. Critics have penned volumes on the law's unintended consequences, but this ACLU summary is succinct: ""It gives sweeping new powers of detention and surveillance to the executive branch."" It deprives ""the courts of meaningful judicial oversight to ensure that the law enforcement powers are not being abused.""

Now here we go again. The 17-page Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act of 2021 would ""authorize dedicated domestic terrorism offices within the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to analyze and monitor domestic terrorist activity and require the federal government to take steps to prevent domestic terrorism.""

What could go wrong with giving the feds more open-ended powers? ""What characteristics are we looking for as we are building this profile of a potential extremist, what are talking about?"" asked former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D–Hawaii) on a recent TV news show. She's right. If you give law-enforcement agencies an inch, they'll take a yard. In building a profile of extremists, she fears that the feds will zero in on evangelicals—or maybe even libertarians.

Of course, our state government is getting in on the action. State Sens. Henry Stern, (D–Los Angeles) and Tom Umberg (D–Santa Ana) have introduced a bill that would create state investigative teams to ""assess potential threats"" from right-wing agitators. Such groups definitely are troublesome, but how will the state define these terms? Will it surveil law-abiding people in the process?

You'd think Americans have learned enough from the unintended consequences of those 1996 and 2001 laws to rush down this path again. One needn't be a member of a wing-nut group—or even a libertarian—to understand how the government might misuse its new powers.

m1myoc	libertarian	Bill to make daylight saving time permanent has bipartisan support | The bill would eliminate the need to change clocks twice a year	"A group of US senators from both parties have submitted a bill to make daylight saving time permanent throughout most of the US.

Currently, daylight saving time is observed from March through November in most of the US, except for most of Arizona and Hawaii. Under the proposal, Arizona would be in the Pacific time zone all year, and Hawaii would be six hours behind the eastern time zone. The bill would also eliminate the need to change clocks twice a year.

The legislation, if approved, would give most of America additional evening daylight in the winter months, but would reduce the amount of morning sunlight during daylight standard time.

Five Republican and three Democratic senators are co-sponsoring the legislation.

Fifteen states have passed bills to move to year-round daylight saving time, but the federal government would have to agree to the changes.

“The call to end the antiquated practice of clock changing is gaining momentum throughout the nation,” Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said. “Studies have shown many benefits of a year-round Daylight Saving Time, which is why the Florida legislature voted to make it permanent in 2018. I’m proud to reintroduce this bipartisan bill to make Daylight Saving Time permanent, and give our nation’s families more stability throughout the year.”

“Americans’ lifestyles are very different than they were when daylight saving time began more than a century ago,” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island said. “Making Daylight Saving Time permanent will end the biannual disruptions to daily life and give families more daylight hours to enjoy after work and school.”

Governments implemented daylight saving time as a measure to conserve energy. While Americans conserve some energy in the evening with more daylight, research has found that the benefit is negated by increased energy usage in the morning.

President Richard Nixon implemented year-round daylight saving time in 1974 as America was affected by an energy shortage. The act ended in 1975 as Congress established a standard practice for daylight saving time, allowing for winter mornings to have more daylight, so more people could go to work and school in the daylight."	right

k05b2f	libertarian	While you are instructed to have a zoom Thanksgiving, 22 people including members of the California Medical Board ran up $15,000 in booze at a fancy dinner with no masks and no social distancing.	"Award-winning journalist Adam Housley — a previous Emmy, AP, and RTNDA recipient — claimed, Monday, that California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s infamous dinner at Yountville’s The French Laundry was even worse than what was initially reported.

In an explosive tweet on Monday, the former Fox News correspondent claimed that the dinner that Newsom attended had 22 guests, not 12, and ran up a bar bill of over $15k. Masks were not worn, he said.

“Because Yountville is my hometown..and where the French Laundry is located…I thought I’d do some digging. Facts about the Newsom dinner. The bar bill was around 15-thousand. 22 people in attendance, not 12. No masks. All indoors. They got so loud, other patrons complained,” Housley tweeted.

“There was ‘zero effort’ to go outside and there was no social distancing of any type. I’m also told some of those there are now privately laughing at the controversy. Remember this is my little hometown. The walls speak,” he added.

As The Daily Wire reported earlier in the month, Gavin Newsom became embroiled in controversy after reports said he attended a multi-family birthday party for a political adviser at The French Laundry. Initially, a spokesperson defended Newsom’s decision to partake in the event, arguing that it took place outdoors; days later, however, that excuse fell to the wayside when photos revealed the party took place indoors with almost no social distancing and no mask-wearing. Newsom eventually apologized, writing it off as a mistake.

“I want to apologize to you because I need to preach and practice, not just preach and not practice, and I’ve done my best to do that,” Newsom said. “We’re all human. We all fall short sometimes.”

“As soon as I sat down at the larger table I realized it was a little larger group than I had anticipated and I made a bad mistake,” he explained. “Instead of sitting down, I should have stood up and walked back, got in my car and drove back to my house.”

The alleged scandal further developed when it was revealed that top California Medical Association officials were also in attendance at the party.

“CEO Dustin Corcoran and top CMA lobbyist Janus Norman both joined the dinner at the French Laundry, an elite Napa fine dining restaurant, to celebrate the 50th birthday of lobbyist and longtime Newsom adviser Jason Kinney, a representative of the powerful interest group confirmed Wednesday morning,” Politico reported. “The presence of CMA brass could amplify criticisms of the dinner occurring despite coronavirus restrictions that have limited Californians’ movements and constrained businesses.”

“The CMA has long been a powerful presence in the state Capitol, and its Sacramento officials are longtime friends with Kinney,” Politico added. “The group spent $2.1 million last year lobbying state leaders.”

Last week, California Department of Public Health instituted a curfew, banning all nonessential activities between the hours of 10 PM and 5 AM.

“The virus is spreading at a pace we haven’t seen since the start of this pandemic and the next several days and weeks will be critical to stop the surge. We are sounding the alarm,” Newsom said in a statement. “It is crucial that we act to decrease transmission and slow hospitalizations before the death count surges. We’ve done it before and we must do it again.”

Antioch police determined that his rifle was purchased, stored and used in Wisconsin — not in violation of Illinois law, the state’s attorney’s office said Tuesday in a statement.

Also, there is no evidence the gun was ever possessed by Rittenhouse, 17, in Illinois, prosecutors said.

Rittenhouse was arrested at his Antioch home a day after prosecutors say he shot and killed two protesters and injured a third in Kenosha on Aug. 25 during protests over Jacob Blake’s shooting.

Rittenhouse is charged with first-degree intentional homicide in the killing of two protesters and attempted intentional homicide in the wounding of a third. He also faces a misdemeanor charge of underage firearm possession for wielding a semi-automatic rifle in Wisconsin.

He remains held in a juvenile detention center in Lake County without bond due to pending criminal charges in Kenosha. Rittenhouse is due in Lake County court on Oct. 30 for an extradition hearing.

Article content OTTAWA — The RCMP has quietly outlawed hundreds of rifles and shotguns over the past month, adding to the list of 1,500 firearms already banned by the Liberal government on May 1. The list has been expanded without public notifications from either the RCMP or the federal government, raising concerns among gun sellers and owners that they could have unknowingly bought, sold or transported illegal firearms in recent weeks. The recently banned firearms have all been deemed illegal retroactively, as of May 1. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Article content The RCMP did not respond to questions about how many firearms it has added retroactively to its Firearms Reference Table (FRT) since the beginning of May. The FRT serves as the official reference for what firearms are illegal under Canadian law. The RCMP designates firearms as legal or illegal based on its interpretation of Ottawa’s regulations, which were updated on May 1 in an effort to ban military platform rifles like the AR-15 and AR-10. A data set compiled by the Canadian Sporting Arms and Ammunition Association (CSAAA), shared with the National Post, suggests that at least 320 rifles and shotguns have been added to the original list of 1,500. The National Post independently verified 200 of the firearms included in the list, all of which appear in the updated FRT, but not in Ottawa’s initial Order in Council.

Article content A spokesperson for Blair said the government is “considering options” for how it can make the list of banned firearms more available and transparent for firearms owners, retailers and manufacturers. “We continue to work with the RCMP to ensure that the public Firearms Reference Table is updated as quickly and as thoroughly as possible to reflect changes that were brought in that day,” Mary-Liz Power said in a written statement. Their discretion is wide-ranging Blair defended the sweeping prohibition in early May, after some confusion emerged over whether some 10 and 12-gauge shotguns could be included in the ban, due to a provision that outlaws any firearm with a bore diameter greater than 20 millimetres. Blair tweeted on May 5 that those claims were “absolutely incorrect” but did not update the terminology in the regulations. The RCMP later posted guidelines on its website that seemed to suggest shotgun bores would not be measured in a way that would outlaw them. The RCMP’s updated list, however, does outlaw a number of four-gauge shotguns under the 20mm provision, including the Webley & Scott Wild Fowl Gun, a bird hunting firearm; the single-shot Duck Gun made by W.W. Greener, an English manufacturer; and the obscure Russian-made TOZ, among others. A number of other 12-gauge semi-automatic shotguns are now prohibited under the new FRT. Ottawa’s May 1 regulations banned eleven types of firearms, which initially encapsulated roughly 1,500 types gun variants. The regulations broadly outlawed “assault-style firearms,” which many observers called an arbitrary distinction.

Alison de Groot, managing director of the CSAAA, said the vague provisions within the Liberal regulations act as a catch-all that could constantly keep firearms owners in the dark about the legal status of their guns. Ottawa has declined to provide details as to when the FRT update could be complete. “It’s at their discretion, which means we have no assurances, either as businesses or firearms owners, about what is allowed,” she said. “Because their discretion is wide-ranging.”

The CSAAA has been calling on Ottawa to compensate retailers and distributors by up to $1.1 billion, after the ban left small businesses sitting on massive piles of inventory that can no longer be sold. Sales in many stores have ground to a halt as owners struggle to navigate daily changes to the prohibition list. “I’ve never seen anything like this, in any country,” said Wes Winkel, owner of Ontario-based Ellwood Epps Sporting Goods. Photo by Jonathan Hayward/The Canadian Press/File Winkel says 22 per cent of his inventory is now unsellable due to the Liberal ban, and new additions to the prohibition list have only deepened the confusion. The Turkish-made F12 Typhoon shotgun, for example, is now considered illegal under the recent updates, while the nearly identical Derya MK12 made by the same company remains non-restricted.

Article content “We’re at a point now where it’s become so nonsensical that we’ve just started to pull inventory,” Winkel said. In a letter to Blair last week, the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (OFAH) warned that illegal firearms “could have been used, transported, transferred or even attempted to be imported” due to the late classification of hundreds of rifle variants. “The fact that the government is still determining what firearms are prohibited many weeks after the amended regulations came into force is a sure signal that these changes were not given the necessary time and scrutiny required for regulatory development of this magnitude,” the letter said. Retailers will also be forced to cover storage costs for illegally imported firearms held by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), even if those purchases were made legally in early May, but later deemed prohibited.

Article content We’re at a point now where it’s become so nonsensical The OFAH also decried the decision by the Liberal government to publish the Order in Council at a time when Parliament was operating on a limited basis, and when the general public was focussed on the COVID-19 pandemic. “An Order in Council (OIC) may be a legal instrument to prescribe prohibitions, but it does not exempt the Government of Canada from the due diligence and rigor of the robust regulatory process that Canadians deserve,” the letter said. Blair has said the Liberal government is crafting a buy back program for firearms deemed illegal under the new regulations, but has yet to provide details on the policy. Blair also said his government is looking to introduce a handgun ban when Parliament resumes, the enforcement of which would likely be left up to municipalities. Gun advocates say the Liberal ban penalizes law-abiding citizens, while ignoring criminals who obtain their firearms illegally, and are responsible for much of the gun violence in Canada. People who support the ban say it will lower violence levels across the board by making guns less accessible to the public. • Email: jsnyder@postmedia.com | Twitter: jesse_snyder

kfa0xb	libertarian	Justin Amash Introduces Bill To End Civil Asset Forfeiture Nationwide	"Rep. Justin Amash (L–Mich.) on Thursday introduced a bill to end civil asset forfeiture, which allows the government to take property from someone without ever charging them with a crime.

Law enforcement on the local, state, and federal levels can seize assets if they were thought to be used in connection with illegal activity. That's often based solely on suspicion, though. Many people never receive their items back, even if they were acquitted or never indicted in the first place. Since 2000, state and local governments have robbed people of more than $68 billion.

Police often deposit those sums into slush funds for their departments.

What's more, the property seized doesn't necessarily have to have been used by the alleged criminal in question. Such was the case with Kevin McBride, who had his Jeep taken by police in Tucson, Arizona, after his girlfriend allegedly used it to sell $25 worth of weed to an undercover cop.

Amash's bill would eliminate the practice as we know it nationwide. ""Civil asset forfeiture is a due process violation, and it always has been,"" said Amash in a statement. ""Its history is riddled with injustices not because it's a valid practice that gets misused, but because its central premise—denying people their procedural rights—is inherently flawed. By ending it, my bill helps fulfill Congress's obligation to stop rights violations at both the state and federal level, and it ends a practice that contributes to the frayed relationship between law enforcement and the public.""

It seems to be commonsense that civil asset forfeiture plainly violates our constitutional rights, particularly as laid out under the Fourth and 14th Amendments. On the federal level, Amash's bill ends the practice outright. ""No person shall be required, under the laws of the United States, to forfeit to the United States any property, real or personal, pursuant to a civil forfeiture proceeding, including a nonjudicial civil forfeiture proceeding,"" the bill reads. Such a change would ensure, for instance, that the Drug Enforcement Administration is no longer allowed to seize money at airports, as has been their practice when travelers carry large sums. The agency stole $43,000 from a woman in Wilmington, North Carolina, and $82,373 from an elderly man in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, simply because they dared to fly with it. Neither was ever charged with involvement in the drug trade.

The legislation also quashes the practice at the state level by prohibiting governments from taking assets unless they secure a conviction against the alleged offender or determine via a civil proceeding that the property owner committed the offense begetting forfeiture.

The libertarian congressman, who is retiring after this session, has long been a proponent of criminal justice reform. Earlier this year, he introduced the first bill to abolish qualified immunity, the legal doctrine that makes it difficult to hold public officials accountable for violating your civil rights.

""The Constitution authorizes and obligates each branch of the Federal Government to protect individual rights,"" the bill reads. ""The long-term failure of Congress, presidents, and the judiciary to recognize the illegitimacy of the government's civil forfeiture practices does not divest them of the authority to do so. The government cannot lawfully jettison the rights of the accused for the sake of convenience and profit."""	right

gywtni	libertarian	Black Civilians Arm Themselves To Protest Racial Violence and Protect Black-Owned Businesses	"In the wake of the police-involved death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, armed black activists have stepped up as the city endures protests, riots, and looting.

A video of a group of armed black residents in St. Paul went viral on Thursday. The video shows armed black men standing in front of a store. The person who is recording says that the business they're protecting is black-owned. A black gunman can be seen in the background of another video featuring civilians protecting a store.

Black militias are guarding black owned businesses with automatic rifles pic.twitter.com/YIzyHixFWc — Zoomer Clips (@ZoomerClips) May 28, 2020

The armed civilians aren't just protecting property. They're also using their Second Amendment rights to bolster their First Amendment right to protest.

A man who calls himself The Official Grand Master Jay (it's unclear whether this is a nickname or just a social media handle) leads a group called the Not Fucking Around Coalition (NFAC), a black group that he says is compromised of ""ex military shooters,"" and he's been using his social media accounts to showcase his group's armed protests in the wake of Floyd's death. NFAC previously gathered in the Georgia neighborhood where Ahmaud Arbery was shot and killed by two white residents while unarmed and out jogging.

In a clip from one of his livestreamed discussions, The Official Grand Master Jay touted the power of armed protests by speaking about an encounter with officers that ended peacefully.

Other armed protesters have recently made headlines for defending their beliefs. After protesters advocating for the reopening of the economy following COVID-19 lockdowns swarmed the Michigan Capitol, a group of concerned black residents organized the armed escort of black state legislator Sarah Anthony in response. Several in the group carried rifles as they walked her safely to the building.

The arrival of militia members and armed private citizens is to be expected in cities where there is intense fallout from fatal use-of-force incidents. Black activists, some inspired by the likes of Malcolm X and the Black Panthers, are using their guns to remind the public that they, too, have a voice."	right
hv6nyt	libertarian	Why Are Taxpayers Footing the Bill for Full-Time Police Union Employees?	"Police departments, fire departments, and school districts across the country pay thousands of public employees full-time salaries to do no work for the public. Instead, they work solely on behalf of the employees' unions. This practice, called ""release time,"" means taxpayers must pay the salaries of officers who lobby against police reforms, such as eliminating qualified immunity and requiring cops to wear body cameras. When Houston Police Officers' Union chief Joe Gamaldi tells lawmakers not to change qualified immunity, he's doing so on ""MBA Union Business Leave"" time—funded by tax dollars.

Phoenix taxpayers pay about $3.7 million annually for officers whose only job is to work for the police union—lobbying, recruiting members, or representing employees in disputes with city officials—instead of patrolling the streets. This amounts to about 73,000 person-hours that could be spent on anything from fighting crime to de-escalation training.

Release time provisions are embedded in collective bargaining agreements. Sometimes these expressly say that ""released"" employees won't be assigned public duties but will instead work for the union itself. The Jersey City Education Association, for example, specified in its contract with the school district that the union's president and vice president would receive government paychecks but ""shall be permitted to devote all of [their] time to the [union's] business and affairs."" They weren't required to report to anyone, or specify how they spent their time, and school district officials were not allowed to assign them work. Instead, they spent all their working hours on union activities, including filing grievances, circulating literature, and attending ""gatherings"" on the union's behalf.

Many cities and unions refuse to disclose how much time and money is involved, so it's impossible to say for certain how much it costs. But Mallory Factor, a professor of international politics and American government at the Citadel, has estimated that release time costs the nation's taxpayers $1 billion each year. That's almost certainly an underestimate, since release time exists across agencies and entities and is largely under the radar. But in Jacksonville, Florida, for example, the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) is entitled to 2,500 hours to be spent ""by any member of the F.O.P. for F.O.P. activities"" instead of police work. In Tampa, more than a quarter of a million taxpayer dollars a year fund some 10,000 hours of ""release time"" for public-sector union bosses. In Austin, police, fire, and emergency medical services unions all obtained agreements that pay union officials to lobby for more benefits—a perpetual motion machine whereby taxpayers pay people to demand more taxpayer money.

Release time's defenders say it benefits taxpayers by helping resolve employment disputes and ensuring a more orderly work environment, but the facts don't bear that out. When the Goldwater Institute sued the Jersey City School District, for example, the union admitted there were no rules in place to ensure that officials actually performed such tasks. On the contrary, since ""released"" union officials negotiate against the government for pay and benefits, ""release"" is actually adverse to the public purse. And if ""labor peace"" is the objective, it doesn't seem to work. In 2016, Jersey City teachers, led by ""released"" union officers, went on strike after their negotiations with the district failed. As the state's Commission of Investigation found, ""union representatives, first and foremost, are in the business of promoting the interests of private entities and their dues-paying members, not those of the taxpayers.""

The costs aren't just financial—they're social, too. Public sector unions occupy an anomalous position in a democracy: intermediaries between the people and their government. This gives them a unique monopoly, since taxpayers can't shop elsewhere.

Because public employees are paid by tax money, those demands are not limited by the forces that restrain private sector unions. The United Auto Workers must always remember that if they insist on too much, General Motors or Ford will go bankrupt and everybody will lose their jobs. That's not true in the public sector, where the concessions unions obtain are limited only by the voters' tolerance—and often not even that, since constitutional rules limit the government's ability to undo contracts made in the past. Recent pension reform cases show that if voters balk at wasteful spending, they often have no effective way to repeal a bad bargain.

Release time is also used to provide defenses for officers facing disciplinary charges. If a cop shoots an innocent citizen, he or she can't be fired without a hearing—and at that hearing, the officer is entitled to representation funded by citizens. The same goes for other government employees, including teachers or principals who violate students' rights. Victims of official wrongdoing surely take little comfort in the fact that they are paying to protect the jobs of the people who abused them. And I doubt it gratifies other cops or teachers when they get lumped in with the wrongdoers in the inevitable public backlash.

Favors like release time create a distinct, privileged class of Americans. They're neither publicly accountable government agents nor private citizens, but a specially favored cadre, paid by often-dissatisfied ""customers"" and overseen by ""employers"" who have little effective power to fire or discipline them. That is extraordinarily dangerous, because it removes public employees' responsibility without diminishing their authority. It's no wonder many citizens view public employees—especially police officers—not as fellow citizens, let alone as their agents, but as occupiers and adversaries."	right
huabq3	libertarian	Oregon will sue federal police agencies, open criminal investigation into use of force	"Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum announced late Friday that her office would sue several federal law enforcement agencies over their response to Portland protests and launch a criminal investigation into an incident of force by federal officers.

Rosenblum is seeking a temporary restraining order to stop federal officers from detaining Portlanders, arguing federal agencies seized and detained Oregonians without probable cause. She said the state’s lawsuit in federal court will name the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Marshals Service, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Federal Protection Service as defendants.

“The federal administration has chosen Portland to use their scare tactics to stop our residents from protesting police brutality and from supporting the Black Lives Matter movement,” Rosenblum said in a statement. “Every American should be repulsed when they see this happening. If this can happen here in Portland, it can happen anywhere.”

Rosenblum also said the state and the Multnomah County District Attorney’s office would criminally investigate the shooting by federal officers of Donavan La Bella in the face with a less-lethal munition Saturday, critically injuring him. La Bella’s hands were above his head when he was shot.

Earlier Friday, U.S. Attorney for Oregon Billy Williams called for an investigation into reports that federal officers had detained two protesters without probable cause. Williams had previously launched a federal investigation into the shooting of La Bella.

Rosenblum’s announcement comes after several days of criticism traded between officials in Oregon with federal officials over the continued use of force and chemical weapons by federal officers on Portlanders.

“I share the concerns of our state and local leaders – and our Oregon U.S. senators and certain congressional representatives – that the current escalation of fear and violence in downtown Portland is being driven by federal law enforcement tactics that are entirely unnecessary and out of character with the Oregon way,” Rosenblum said. “These tactics must stop.”

gwcxqp	libertarian	"Google faces $5 BILLION lawsuit for illegally invading the privacy of millions of users by tracking their internet use through ""incognito mode"""	"Google was sued on Tuesday in a proposed class action accusing the internet search company of illegally invading the privacy of millions of users by pervasively tracking their internet use through browsers set in 'private' mode.

Attorneys for the plaintiffs accused Google of becoming 'an unaccountable trove of information so detailed and expansive that George Orwell could never have dreamed it.'

The complaint states: 'Through its pervasive data tracking business, Google knows who your friends are, what your hobbies are, what you like to eat, what movies you watch, where and when you like to shop, what your favorite vacation destinations are, what your favorite color is, and even the most intimate and potentially embarrassing things you browse on the internet—regardless of whether you follow Google’s advice to keep your activities “private.”

'Indeed, notwithstanding consumers’ best efforts, Google has made itself an unaccountable trove of information so detailed and expansive that George Orwell could never have dreamed it.'

Google's 'incognito' mode is promoted as offering a higher level of privacy for browsers. A new lawsuit, filed on Tuesday, accuses Google of still tracking people despite the mode being on

The lawsuit seeks at least $5 billion, accusing the Alphabet Inc unit of surreptitiously collecting information about what people view online and where they browse, despite their using what Google calls Incognito mode.

'Google’s practices infringe upon users’ privacy; intentionally deceive consumers; give Google and its employees power to learn intimate details about individuals’ lives, interests, and internet usage; and make Google “one stop shopping” for any government, private, or criminal actor who wants to undermine individuals’ privacy, security, or freedom,' the complaint states.

The document, filed in the federal court in San Jose, California, alleges that Google gathers data through Google Analytics, Google Ad Manager and other applications and website plug-ins, including smartphone apps - regardless of whether users click on Google-supported ads.

This helps Google learn about users' friends, hobbies, favorite foods, shopping habits, and even the 'most intimate and potentially embarrassing things' they search for online, the complaint said.

'Google must be held accountable for the harm it has caused to its users in order to ensure it cannot continue to engage in the covert and unauthorized data collection from virtually every American with a computer or phone,' the complaint said.

Their case comes a week after Arizona's attorney general, Mark Brnovich, filed a suit alleging that Google kept tabs on the whereabouts of its users even if they had turned off location tracking.

Brnovich said the behavior would violate the Arizona Consumer Fraud Act.

A Google spokesman said Brnovich and the 'contingency fee lawyers' who brought the case have mischaracterized the company's services, noting: 'We have always built privacy features into our products and provided robust controls for location data.'

The damages sought in that lawsuit could run to hundreds of millions of dollars, with Arizona seeking all profits derived from the alleged deceptive practices, as well as a $10,000 fine per violation

Jose Castaneda, a Google spokesman, said the Mountain View, California-based company will also defend itself vigorously against the news claims.

'As we clearly state each time you open a new incognito tab, websites might be able to collect information about your browsing activity,' he said.

Google has said it will vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit, which seeks $5 billion

While users may view private browsing as a safe haven from watchful eyes, computer security researchers have long raised concern that Google and rivals might augment user profiles by tracking people's identities across different browsing modes, combining data from private and ordinary internet surfing.

The complaint said the proposed class likely includes 'millions' of Google users who since June 1, 2016 browsed the internet in 'private' mode.

They note that Google's huge success - the parent company, Alphabet, is worth $950 billion - results from its 'unparalleled tracking and collection of consumer personal information and selling and brokering of that information to optimize advertisement services.'

It seeks at least $5,000 of damages per user for violations of federal wiretapping and California privacy laws, and the plaintiffs are seeking a jury trial.

In the complaint, they state: 'Google receives detailed, personal information such as the user’s IP address (which may provide geographic information), what the user is viewing, what the user last viewed, and details about the user’s hardware.'

Boies Schiller & Flexner represents the plaintiffs Chasom Brown, Maria Nguyen and William Byatt.

kvspuc	libertarian	The Cancellation of Josh Hawley's Book Deal Isn't a First Amendment Issue. The First Amendment certainly can’t compel a publisher to publish a book, whether that book is written by a public official or otherwise.	"But could this cancellation violate Hawley’s contract? Well, the contract hasn’t been made public, but as I recently experienced with my own book deal, book contracts generally give the publisher great leeway. It could be that Simon & Schuster gets to walk away but Hawley gets to keep his advance, or there could be some other previously agreed‐​upon arrangement. There’s certainly a chance that the publisher is breaching the contract—it may have determined that it would lose money if it published the book, meaning that this is what law‐​and‐​economics scholars call an “efficient breach”—in which case it owes Hawley “liquidated damages” as set out in the contract or under generally accepted principles of contract law. Either way, the First Amendment isn’t at issue.

Finally, though, there’s a non‐​legal issue at play: the idea that large corporations, cultural and otherwise, are “canceling” conservatives (and libertarians) in various ways. Indeed, such “censorship” by Facebook, Google and Twitter is the very subject of Hawley’s book. The extent to which this phenomenon is real or concerning depends a lot on specific facts. Surely, if it had turned out that an author was a neo‐​Nazi Holocaust denier—or a Klan member, or a Stalinist—few would object to “de‐​platforming” him. So this is largely a debate about the “Overton window” of appropriate public discourse and policing what I’ve previously called the Satan‐​Scherbatsky line.

It’s certainly troubling that, for example, The New York Times’ publication of an op‐​ed by Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) on how best to quell last summer’s rioting caused the opinion editor to lose his job, while the Gray Lady publishes regular apologies for Communist regimes (as recently as last Monday). And there are indeed “woke mobs” out there, most notably on social media, even if that choice of words was unfortunate in light of the actual mob that Hawley fist‐​pumped last Wednesday.

These are real cultural pathologies that our society must grapple with. But that doesn’t mean there’s a role for government to fix these issues—and they’re certainly not First Amendment violations."	right
l7u6c8	libertarian	Google salvaged Robinhood’s one-star rating by deleting nearly 100,000 negative reviews	"Google is actively removing negative reviews of the Robinhood app from the Google Play Store, the company confirmed to The Verge. After some disgruntled Robinhood users organized campaigns to give the app a one-star review on Google’s Play Store and Apple’s App Store — and succeeded in review-bombing it all the way down to a one-star rating — the company has now deleted enough reviews to bring it back up to nearly four stars.

Robinhood came under intense scrutiny on Thursday, after the stock trading app announced it would block purchases of GameStop, AMC, and other stocks made popular by the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, and some users have already replaced their deleted one-star reviews with new ones to make their anger heard.

Here’s a screenshot from the Play Store page captured by 9to5Google when the app had a one-star rating and nearly 275,000 reviews:

And here’s a screenshot we took shortly before publishing this article, showing a nearly four-star rating and around 180,000 reviews.

It’s not outside Google’s purview to delete these posts. Google’s policies explicitly prohibit reviews intended to manipulate an app’s rating, and the company says it has a system that “combines human intelligence with machine learning to detect and enforce policy violations in ratings and reviews.” Google says it specifically took action on reviews that it felt confident violated those policies, the company tells The Verge. Google says companies do not have the ability to delete reviews themselves.

On Apple’s App Store, Robinhood has a 4.7 rating, and we didn’t see any reviews newer than Wednesday. However, popular apps like TikTok, Uno, and Genshin Impact also didn’t have reviews from any later than Wednesday when we checked.

Unhappy Robinhood users aren’t just using reviews to show their ire — they’re also calling for a class action lawsuit. Later on Thursday, Robinhood said it would allow “limited buys” of certain stocks on Friday. The company said that halting purchases on Thursday was “a risk-management decision.”"	right
humdbx	libertarian	New Jersey federal judge’s son killed, husband shot at home by gunman dressed as FedEx worker. She was assigned to the Jeffrey Epstein Deutsche Bank case 4 days earlier.	"A gunman wearing a FedEx driver's uniform on Sunday killed the son and wounded the husband of a federal judge linked to high-profile cases involving Jeffrey Epstein, a ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"" couple and gangs, in a shocking murder now being probed by the FBI.

The shooting occurred at the North Brunswick, N.J., home of Judge Esther Salas, a source told The Associated Press. The AP report, citing the state’s chief district judge, said the son, 20, was killed. NJ.com reported that the shooting occurred at about 5 p.m.

‘RHONJ’ STAR TERESA GIUDICE 'VERY SHAKEN' BY NEWS OF ATTACK ON JUDGE'S FAMILY: ATTORNEY

“The FBI is investigating a shooting at the home of Judge Salas. We are working with our local and state partners,” Doreen Holder, the public information officer for the bureau’s Newark office, told Fox News.

U.S. Marshals and state and local authorities are also investigating.

Salas' husband, defense lawyer Mark Anderl, 63, was injured, the AP reported. Salas was in the basement at the time and wasn't hurt, the report said.

CHICAGO'S VIOLENT WEEKEND SEES AT LEAST 8 KILLED, 40 OTHERS SHOT, POLICE SAY

The gunman posed as a delivery driver for FedEx, two sources told NJ.com. The report said that Salas, 51, was the first Hispanic female appointed to the U.S. District Court in New Jersey.

Daniel Anderl, a college student, was the judge's only child, the AP reported.

A FedEx spokesperson said the company is ""fully cooperating"" with the investigation.

Salas' highest-profile case in recent years was the financial fraud case involving ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"" reality TV stars Teresa and Joe Giudice, whom Salas sentenced to prison for crimes including bankruptcy fraud and tax evasion. Salas staggered their sentences so that one of them could be available to take care of their four children.

In an emailed statement provided to Fox News, Teresa Giudice's attorney, James Leonard Jr., called the news ""absolutely devastating.""

“Teresa was very shaken by the news and was very emotional when she heard about it,"" Leonard wrote. ""She told me that would be praying very heavily for Judge Salas and her family.""

In 2016, Salas sentenced a Crips gang member to 15 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute heroin, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.

In 2017, she barred federal prosecutors from seeking the death penalty against an alleged gang leader charged in several Newark slayings, ruling the man's intellectual disability made him ineligible for capital punishment. Salas later sentenced the man to 45 years in prison, the AP reported.

Salas has presided over an ongoing lawsuit brought by Deutsche Bank investors who claim the company made false and misleading statements about its anti-money laundering policies and failed to monitor ""high-risk"" customers including convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

kc1l64	libertarian	‘Drugs have won’: Matt Gaetz defends federal pot decriminalization act as sole Republican co-sponsor -- “The federal government has lied to the people of this country about marijuana for a generation,” Gaetz said.	"Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz dug his heels Friday as the sole Republican co-sponsor to legislation that would, among other things, decriminalize marijuana at the federal level.

The House voted in favor of the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act, H.R. 3884, with a vote of 228-164. The Act would also expunge lower-level federal marijuana offenses and create a 5% excise tax. The tax would be used to support businesses and individuals “impacted by the war on drugs.”

Gaetz voted in favor of the legislation and spoke in support before lawmakers on the House floor.

“The federal government has lied to the people of this country about marijuana for a generation,” Gaetz said. “We have seen a generation, particularly of black and brown youth, locked up for offenses that should have not resulted in any incarceration whatsoever.”

Notably, the Panhandle congressman described the MORE Act as “flawed” and lamented that it would create new taxes and programs.

He contended, however, that cannabis reform has enjoyed “overwhelming support” in states where it has appeared on the ballot.

He added that arguments by Republican colleagues against cannabis reform are “losing with the American people.”

“The only thing that I know that’s more popular than getting out of the war on drugs is getting out of the war in Afghanistan,” Gaetz said.

While the act is unlikely to survive the Republican-controlled Senate, Gaetz encouraged the 117th Congress to take up the States Act.

The States Act, H.R. 2093, would allow states to set policies approving or prohibiting cannabis without federal interference.

The bill, however, would not legalize cannabis at the federal level.

“If we were measuring the success in the war on drugs, it would be hard to conclude anything other than the fact that drugs have won,” Gaetz said.

Several Florida lawmakers including Democratic Congressman Charlie Crist also voted in favor of the MORE Act.

In a news release, Crist said marijuana criminalization not only hurts communities of color but military veterans as well.

“Cannabis prohibition also keeps medical cannabis out of the hands of veterans in need,” Crist said. “That’s why state after state is approving legalization, and why the federal government should follow their lead and work to right the wrongs of the past.”

Crist, a former Florida Governor, highlighted that the federal government could collect more than $100 billion in tax revenue annually by removing federal restrictions.

Meanwhile, Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, the state’s highest elected Democrat, celebrated the bill’s passage in a news release.

She noted that 68% of Americans support marijuana legalization as of November 2020, according to Gallup.

“I am hopeful that this long overdue measure will be prioritized in the 117th Congress, on behalf of the countless families whose lives were upended by the war on drugs, patients who need safe and secure access to medical marijuana, and the diverse array of entrepreneurs seeking the economic potential of this growing industry, including hemp farmers right here in Florida,” Fried said."	right
lnugkp	libertarian	Supreme Court asked to declare the all-male military draft unconstitutional	"A new petition issued from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has made it to the Supreme Court and aims to declare the historic male-only military draft to be unconstitutional.

Noting that the U.S. Department of Defense lifted the ban on women serving in combat in 2013, the petition specifies that the obligation for men to register upon turning 18 years old has yet to be applied to women.

“Thousands of women have since served with distinction in combat positions across all branches of the military,” the formal petition reads. “The registration requirement has no legitimate purpose and cannot withstand the exacting scrutiny sex-based laws require.”

Rooted in this argument is the 1981 case Rostker v. Goldberg, which argued that because American men are required to register under U.S. law and women are not, the male-only draft is discriminatory and unconstitutional.

The act gives U.S. presidents the power to require mandatory conscription of eligible adult males into the U.S. Army, but excludes women. Ultimately, the court held that the act does not violate equal protection clauses under the Fifth Amendment, and that the government is allowed to develop an army in times of national emergency.

Now, the petition asks the Supreme Court to overrule Rostker v. Goldberg since women are formally allowed to register for military service and in combat roles.

“It is time to overrule Rostker. The registration requirement has no legitimate purpose and cannot withstand the exacting scrutiny sex-based laws require,” the petition states, citing that military departments acknowledge that requiring both men and women to register would “'promote fairness and equity’ and further the goal of military readiness.”

The Department of Defense has made strides in including women in combat roles, authoring a report in 2015 that called its own previous standards excluding women from military work “outdated.”

In 2017, a committee was established to review the draft policy within the Military Selective Service Act to evaluate if the draft should be expanded to incorporate women recruits. Despite a commission analysis that recommended the inclusion, Congress has yet to make the requirement for women official.

The Washington Post further notes that last week, a group of veterans who held military leadership roles asked the Supreme Court to take the case and rule the male-only draft requirement a violation of the equal protection clause.

“The vast majority of men . . . have no advantage in readiness over women, who the current statutory scheme forbid from registering,” the brief, filed by former National Security Agency (NSA) director Michael Hayden, reportedly said.

Debate over whether or not the draft requirement for men is constitutional has ensued in multiple lower courts, but these revitalized petitions ask the Supreme Court to overturn their original 1981 ruling.

The petition’s authors also note that by excluding women from draft registration requirements, it undermines their own equality as U.S. citizens.

“Like many laws that have purported to privilege women over men, the men-only registration requirement burdens women too by perpetuating the notion that women are unworthy of ‘full citizenship stature,’” the report concludes, citing another Supreme Court case regarding the treatment of women in the military. “Excluding women from a duty characterized as a ‘fundamental civic obligation’ conveys 'not only that they are not vital to the defense of the country but also that they are not expected to participate in defending it.'”

The Supreme Court could reportedly take months before deciding to revisit Rostker v. Goldberg."	right
kb22z9	libertarian	Reps. Tulsi Gabbard And Markwayne Mullin Introduce Bill That Would Allow Only Biological Females In Women’s Sports	"Democratic Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Republican Oklahoma Rep. Markwayne Mullin introduced legislation that would clarify Title IX protections for female athletes as based on biological sex, a press release said Thursday.

The “Protect Women’s Sports Act” recognizes the different abilities conferred by biological sex, the statement says. Title IX protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive federal funding.

“Title IX was a historic provision championed by Hawaii’s own Congresswoman Patsy Mink in order to provide equal opportunity for women and girls in high school and college sports,” Gabbard said in the statement. “It led to a generational shift that impacted countless women, creating life-changing opportunities for girls and women that never existed before.”

“However, Title IX is being weakened by some states who are misinterpreting Title IX, creating uncertainty, undue hardship and lost opportunities for female athletes. Our legislation protects Title IX’s original intent which was based on the general biological distinction between men and women athletes based on sex,”

The Supreme Court determined in June that discrimination on the basis of gender identity also constitutes sex discrimination within the meaning of VII of the Civil Rights Act. Weeks prior, the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights decided in a complaint involving Connecticut high school sports that permitting transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports violates the civil rights of female athletes.

Twenty-eight Congressional Democrats signed a letter in June condemning the Department of Education for its ruling, accusing the department of discrimination “against transgender youth” by restricting women’s sports to biological females.

“Title IX was designed to give women and girls an equal chance to succeed, including in sports,” Mullin said. “Allowing biological males to compete in women’s sports diminishes that equality and takes away from the original intent of Title IX.” (RELATED: Connecticut Policy Allowing Transgender Athletes In Sports Found To Violate Female Civil Rights)

“As the father of three girls involved in athletics, I want them to be able to compete on a level playing field. I am proud to lead this bill that will safeguard the integrity of women’s sports and ensure female athletes can compete fairly,” he continued.

Attorney General William Barr became involved in the Connecticut lawsuit in March, when he signed a statement of interest arguing the policy allowing transgender athletes to compete in high school sports “deprives those women of the single-sex athletic competitions that are one of the marquee accomplishments of Title IX.”

“It is critical that the legacy of Title IX continues to ensure women and girls in sports have the opportunity to compete and excel on a level playing field,” Gabbard said in the statement."	right
h89p4f	libertarian	"""It's time to kick police unions out of the labor movement."" Huh, Libertarians have only been saying this for the past SEVERAL Decades."	"The ultimate power of the labor movement lies in solidarity. Together, working people are strong. So what can the movement do in this moment of national struggle against racism and police violence? The obvious answer is to deny the power of solidarity to police unions, which function as barriers to the very reforms that Americans are now fighting for. The time has come to put police unions on a raft and set them adrift. Perhaps they can reapply for solidarity if they ever stop abusing the rest of us.

Earlier this week, my union, the Writers Guild of America, East (WGAE), formally called upon the AFL-CIO – America’s largest union coalition, representing 55 unions, including us – to expel police unions from its ranks. (I am one of the 21 elected WGAE council members who unanimously voted to approve this resolution, but I speak here only for myself.) We do not dispute the right of anyone to have a union, but police unions are incompatible with the AFL-CIO’s mission “to vanquish oppression”. For centuries, the police have in fact been the tool of oppression wielded to crush working people. A common thread that runs from striking union members getting their heads bashed in to the tragedy of George Floyd is the presence of aggressive and unaccountable police.

It is worth noting that the AFL-CIO’s own constitution says that affiliated unions can be kicked out if their activities “are consistently directed toward the achievement of the program or purposes of authoritarianism, totalitarianism, terrorism and other forces that suppress individual liberties and freedom of association and oppose the basic principles of free and democratic trade unionism”. When I read those words, I conjure up the image of the combative riot police who unjustly arrested multiple journalists and WGAE members who were peacefully covering the recent protests against police violence.

For centuries, the police have in fact been the tool of oppression wielded to crush working people

Unfortunately, getting police unions out of the broader labor movement will not be easy. The AFL-CIO immediately rejected the WGAE’s resolution with little discussion. Why? It is not as simple as the fear of losing members – the International Union of Police Associations has 100,000 members, a drop in the bucket of the AFL-CIO’s 12.5 million union members. Rather, the union establishment fears for its own existence.

To understand this, you have to keep in mind the fact that business interests have been waging a very successful campaign to destroy all unions for decades now. Union membership among private sector workers has plummeted to less than 7%; among public sector workers, however, more than 33% are in unions. Government workers are by far the strongest sector of organized labor. And big unions are determined not to allow any sort of attack on public sector union membership – even if those unions are police unions, who are protecting cops who beat and kill the rest of us.

Lee Saunders is the head of AFSCME, the most powerful public sector union in the AFL-CIO, which represents 1.4 million state and local government workers, including some cops. In an op-ed this week, he wrote: “Just as it was wrong when racists went out of their way to exclude black people from unions, it is wrong to deny this freedom to police officers today.” Fine. But we don’t need them inside of our labor movement, poisoning it for everyone else. (There is a related strain of argument that says that if we push police out of the labor movement, we’ll lose the ability to influence them for the better. This is laughably disconnected from reality. How has that worked out for us so far? Perhaps if we wait another hundred years, we’ll see some progress?)

It is sad to see the union establishment ruled more by fear of losing what they have than by a vision for a better future

Union leaders think that the American public is too stupid to understand the difference between regular labor unions and police unions. I disagree. Here is the difference: labor unions empower working people. Police unions disempower working people, by making it impossible to reform and hold accountable police forces that systematically abuse, imprison and terrify working people. Likewise, the motivation of the rightwing assault on unions in general is to disempower working people. The motivation for the current campaign to take police unions out of the labor movement is to empower working people by ensuring that the AFL-CIO is not forced to represent a slice of the workforce that is structurally opposed to its broader mission of freedom and equality for the sort of people most likely to be harassed by the police.

This seems simple enough. It is sad to see the union establishment ruled more by fear of losing what they have than by a vision for a better future. Millions of Americans have taken to the streets to cry out for justice. Not only is it the responsibility of the labor movement to stand next to them – it is the responsibility of the labor movement to be them. Union membership has been declining for decades, as inequality rises. This is not a coincidence. A revival of working-class power is vital to fixing many of the underlying issues that have broken our nation. (For example, unions are the only thing that has ever helped close the wage gap between black and white workers.)

The energy that has flowed into the protests must also flow into the labor movement. In order for that to happen, unions and the AFL-CIO need to welcome everyone in. That can’t happen when the cops are guarding the door. Time to make a choice. People over police."	right
hnjyyl	libertarian	China makes criticizing CCP rule in Hong Kong illegal worldwide	"The draconian security law that Beijing forced upon Hong Kong last week contains an article making it illegal for anyone in the world to promote democratic reform for Hong Kong.

Why it matters: China has long sought to crush organized dissent abroad through quiet threats and coercion. Now it has codified that practice into law — potentially forcing people and companies around the world to choose between speaking freely and ever stepping foot in Hong Kong again.

What's happening: Article 38 of the national security law states, ""This Law shall apply to offences under this Law committed against the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region from outside the Region by a person who is not a permanent resident of the Region.""

In other words, every provision of the law applies to everyone outside of Hong Kong — including you.

Several experts in Chinese and international law confirmed this interpretation of the law to Axios.

""It literally applies to every single person on the planet. This is how it reads,"" said Wang Minyao, a Chinese-American lawyer based in New York. ""If I appear at a congressional committee in D.C. and say something critical, that literally would be a violation of this law.""

This means that anyone advocating democracy in Hong Kong, or criticizing the governments in Hong Kong or Beijing, could potentially face consequences if they step foot in Hong Kong, or have assets or family members in Hong Kong.

What they're saying: ""One of the main purposes of having the national security law is to quash the international front of the movement,"" said Nathan Law, a Hong Kong pro-democracy lawmaker, who spoke to Axios after he fled the city last week.

""For Hong Kong, we have to understand that it is the foreground of a very global fight, authoritarianism versus democracy.""

He and other leaders of the pro-democracy movement, including Joshua Wong, have traveled the globe in recent years to promote their cause, including meeting with U.S. lawmakers — an activity that the new law prohibits.

The big picture: This marks a historically unprecedented expansion of extraterritoriality — the application of a country's domestic laws abroad.

U.S. counterterrorism laws have a degree of extraterritoriality, but those laws are intended to fight actual violent terrorism — not free speech — and are not used to crush peaceful political organizing.

The new law codifies and extends to non-Chinese nationals the extraterritorial practices that the Chinese Communist Party has long applied to its own citizens abroad.

Earlier this year a Chinese student at the University of Minnesota was sentenced to six months in prison after returning home to China for the summer, for a tweet criticizing Xi Jinping that he posted while in the U.S.

Chinese officials have also threatened people of Chinese heritage abroad who are no longer Chinese citizens, in some cases kidnapping them, taking them back to China, and forcing them to renounce their foreign citizenship so that Chinese authorities can prosecute them as Chinese nationals without foreign involvement.

Beijing is also increasingly using market access as a form of leverage to silence foreign companies and organizations.

Hollywood movie studios make sure their films don't offend China's censors so they can retain access to China's massive domestic movie market.

After Beijing complained, Marriott fired an employee who used a company social media account to like a post about Tibet.

Until now, this was informal coercion. Now it's the law.

An example: The tweet that Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey posted last year in the support of the Hong Kong protests got the NBA in a lot of trouble in China.

That tweet would likely be illegal under the new law.

What's at stake: The point of the law isn't necessarily to immediately launch a sweeping global dragnet, but rather ""to put the fear of God into all China critics the world over,"" wrote Donald Clarke, a professor Chinese law at George Washington University, in an analysis of the law.

""It’s the obsession with seizing the narrative-setting power,"" said Alvin Cheung, a legal scholar at New York University.

What to watch: Hong Kong authorities may begin to detain or arrest people of any nationality upon entry to Hong Kong for their actions or speech elsewhere — or even issue extradition requests for major targets.

Go deeper: Listen to Bethany talk with Axios Today host Niala Boodhoo about how the new national security law reaches beyond China's borders."	right

jx6972	libertarian	The hypocrisy shown by a California governor, attending a party for lobbyists and CEOs without following guidelines, that he forces others to comply with.	"Officials from the California Medical Association raised eyebrows when they were spotted at a birthday lunch at a fancy French restaurant for a lobbyist and advisor to Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, despite the governor insisting constituents stay at home and take extra precautions due to the worsening COVID-19 pandemic.

NEWSOM LATEST DEMOCRATIC POLITICIAN TO FLOUD OWN CORONAVIRUS GUIDELINES

CEO Dustin Corcoran and top CMA lobbyist Janus Norman joined Newsom and others at the dinner hosted at French Laundry restaurant earlier this month, where attendees of a birthday party for adviser Jason Kinney were seated closely without face masks. Photos obtained by Fox 11 in Los Angeles showed nearly a dozen people sitting together.

A Kinney spokesperson said the event was considered outdoors and did not violate any rules. Newsom has since apologized for not following strictly to his own mandates, which, at the time of the dinner on Nov. 6, included dining restrictions limiting seating to no more than three households gathering together at the same table.

The photo shows at least 10 people-- friends and colleagues of Kinney-- seated at the same table.

The woman who took the photos told Fox 11 that sliding doors leading to the area where the group was gathered were eventually closed due to noise complaints.

SEN. FEINSTEIN SPOTTED WALKING AROUND SENATE WITHOUT A MASK

A spokesperson for the CMA, Anthony York, said in a statement that ""the dinner was held in accordance with state and county guidelines,"" according to reports by Politico.

Although neither Corcoran nor Norman are doctors, the CMA has worked throughout the pandemic, lobbying Newsom for COVID-19 screening and testing guidelines, and funding an ad campaign urging people to wear a mask.

The news comes as Newsom had just announced new coronavirus restrictions this week. These include closing indoor dining in a majority of counties across the state as cases surge in California and across the country.

kns5sp	libertarian	When There Wasn't Enough Hand Sanitizer, Distilleries Stepped Up. Now They're Facing $14,060 FDA Fees.	"UPDATE: It's been a whirlwind 24 hours for American craft distillers, but 2020 is ending with some good news: Thanks to media coverage, including here at Reason, of an unexpected and substantial fee imposed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on distillers who pivoted to produce much-needed hand sanitizer, the federal government has reversed course on what would have been a devastating blow to small businesses. Read more about the last-minute reversal here.

For many American craft distillers, 2020 was already one of their worst years ever. The COVID-19-related closure of tasting rooms and cocktail bars, loss of tourism, and inability to offer in-store sampling slashed their sales revenue and cut them off from their customers. Then this week, just as it seemed they'd made it through the worst of a terrible year, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had one more surprise in store: The agency delivered notice to distilleries that had produced hand sanitizer in the early days of the pandemic that they now owe an unexpected fee to the government of more than $14,000.

""I was in literal disbelief when I read it yesterday,"" says Aaron Bergh, president and distiller at Calwise Spirits in Paso Robles, California. ""I had to confirm with my attorney this morning that it's true."" The surprise fee caught distillers completely off guard, throwing the already suffering industry into confusion.

When the onset of the pandemic led to a massive increase in demand for hand sanitizer this spring, many distilleries stepped up to alleviate the sudden shortage. The main ingredient in sanitizer is ethanol, which they are in the business of making, albeit typically in more fun and tasty formats. More than 800 distilleries pivoted from spirits to sanitizer, offering it for sale or in many cases donating it to their communities free of charge. Their prompt action helped ensure supplies of sanitizer when it was otherwise unobtainable.

(Even then, the FDA needlessly complicated things, imposing additional requirements on top of guidelines published by the World Health Organization for emergency production. The FDA's mandate that all alcohol used in sanitizer first be denatured—rendering it undrinkable—created a bottleneck that raised costs for distillers and slowed production.)

Producing sanitizer is viewed as a point of pride in the distilling business, a way that they were able to help their communities in a fearful time of crisis.

Now, however, that good deed is being punished with unanticipated fees by the FDA. ""I compare it to surprise medical billing,"" says Becky Harris, president of the American Craft Spirits Association (ACSA) and of Catoctin Creek Distilling in Purcellville, Virginia.

At issue is a provision of the CARES Act that reformed regulation of non-prescription drugs. Under the revised law, distilleries that produced sanitizer have been classified as ""over-the-counter drug monograph facilities."" The CARES Act also enacted user fees on these facilities to fund the FDA's regulatory activities. For small distillers, that means ending the year with a surprise bill for $14,060 due on February 11.

""People are incredibly anxious,"" Harris says. ""We have been dealing with tons of phone calls talking to individual members and state guilds to tell them what we know and what we don't know.""

Harris and the ACSA have spent the day trying to learn more details about the law and the FDA's intentions, but the combination of the holidays and the pandemic makes this a difficult time to reach anyone. ""We recognize that this bill [the CARES ACT] was not written specifically for the issue of sanitizer,"" Harris says. ""The problem that we have right now is that [the fee assessment] is going out to a whole lot of small businesses who are struggling in the pandemic.""

Bergh's CalWise Spirits is a typical example. He says that his distillery produced 5,000 gallons of hand sanitizer, with distribution prioritized to medical workers and others on the frontlines of the pandemic response. ""Some of my hand sanitizer was donated,"" he said in a statement today. ""The rest was sold at a fraction of the market price. My goal was to get as much out as I could, at as low of a price as I could, while being able to bring my furloughed employees back to work. The hand sanitizer business saved me from bankruptcy—but I didn't make an enormous profit.""

Potentially compounding the impact of the fee is that it is determined by registration as an OTC (over-the-counter) monograph drug production facility in the previous calendar year. That means that distilleries not only have to contend with this year's fee; if they fail to update their status with the FDA by tomorrow, they may be liable for an additional fee in 2022 as well.

For now, Harris is advising members not to pay the fee right away. ""We want to push back on this,"" she says. She's hopeful that if the FDA has some discretion as to the applicability of the fee, that they will exercise it to exclude distilleries, most of which no longer produce sanitizer and have no intention of continuing to do so now that the emergency shortage has passed. Currently, however, the FDA's website explicitly notes that facilities that produced sanitizer under the agency's temporary COVID-19 policy are not exempt. Reason's inquiry with the FDA has yet to receive a detailed response, but we will update if we receive one.

Paying a surprise $14,000 bill would be a challenge for small businesses in any year, but it's a particular challenge for craft distilleries in 2020. An industry survey conducted earlier this year by the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States and the American Distilling Institute projected that sales revenue at craft distilleries would decline by more than $700 million this year, amounting to approximately 40 percent of their sales.

For many distillers, the unexpected fee assessment from the FDA thus arrives as one more substantial blow in an already devastating year. ""If you were making sanitizer for your community at a limited capacity, this should not be something you have to deal with,"" says Harris. ""It will be a slap in the face to make it through all of this and then get hit with this bill."""	right
h9ejpc	libertarian	Two officers given probation for raping a woman while she was handcuffed in a van. The law was changed to make it illegal for officers to rape people in custody.	"Two former New York police detectives were sentenced to 5 years of probation on Thursday after pleading guilty to receiving bribes and official misconduct for having sex with an 18-year-old woman who was in their custody at the time.

“These defendants engaged in a shocking abuse of power which they finally acknowledged,” Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said in a public statement. “While I would have preferred to see them serve prison time, they are no longer members of our police department and with today’s plea are convicted felons. As a result of this disturbing incident, New York passed a law to prohibit police officers from having sex with people in their custody.”

Eddie Martins, 39, and Richard Hall, 34, were formally detectives with NYPD’s Brooklyn South Narcotics. They plead guilty to two counts of third-degree bribe receiving and nine counts of official misconduct.

According to the District Attorney’s office, the incident took place on Sept. 15, 2017, while then-plainclothes officers Hall and Martins were on duty in Brooklyn. They stopped a car around 8 p.m. and arrested the driver, an 18-year-old woman who admitted to having marijuana and two Klonopin pills. Once in their police van, the two detectives then both engaged in sexual acts with the teen and then released her, giving her back the pills. They did not report the incident — and had no authority to rescind the arrest or release her, according to the District Attorney’s office.

The woman later went a hospital and DNA samples on her matched the two men. They were originally arraigned on 50 rape charges and faced 25 years in prison. The top level charges were later dropped, however, after “serious credibility issues,” according to Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez in the Thursday statement.

Though never disputing that sexual activity had taken place, the officers and their attorneys said it was “consensual.” Defense attorneys argued the victim’s story was inconsistent, and used cell phone records and other evidence to weaken her story, according to the New York Times. Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Danny Chun on Thursday told the court that “the credibility of the victim, or the complainant, in this case was seriously, seriously questionable, at best,” which led to the men accepting a plea deal on lesser charges.

The men both resigned from NYPD in November 2017.

i7481a	libertarian	Americans Are Growing Less Willing To Beg for Permission To Make a Living	"It appears that government-imposed restrictions on travel, business, and social contact don't become more palatable with age. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to simmer, the one competency that officials have consistently displayed is in tightening the screws, using the licenses and permissions they require as enforcement tools. For people tired of being bossed around, the obvious response is to carry on without the government's imprimatur—and they're doing so in droves. It's an attitude likely to live on long after the crisis has passed.

""Our businesses are doomed,"" Chris Polone, co-owner of a Fort Worth bar that was one of more than 800 such establishments to open in defiance of Texas closure orders, said at the end of July. ""We have nothing to lose. We can either fight this thing, Or we can starve ourselves out.""

As apocalyptic as that sounds, it's a reasonable statement when the review site Yelp reports that 55 percent of all businesses shut during the pandemic are believed to have closed their doors forever. For many entrepreneurs, breaking the rules may be the only way to survive.

That the rebellion among Texas taverns is alive and well is obvious from a desperate-sounding open letter issued last week by the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission (TABC). ""Recently we have spoken with business owners who tell us they don't intend to follow the orders,"" wrote A. Bentley Nettles, the commission's executive director. ""When a business tells TABC it doesn't intend to follow these orders, you leave the agency with no option but to revoke your license and shut you down.""

The letter contains much huffing and puffing about how it's a ""privilege"" to be in the booze business, subject to following politicians' dictates. But that's what government officials always say when they impose licensing requirements on people trying to make a living. Then, feeding yourself and keeping a roof over your head becomes subject to jumping through hoops, paying fees, and keeping the right people happy.

With one out of four U.S. jobs now requiring an occupational license—not to mention the business licenses, liquor licenses, and other forms of official permission that businesses must pursue—legally making a buck can be a precarious activity even in good times. It gets that much worse when a crisis drives politicians into frenzies of panic and power-lust, with the authority to grant and revoke permissions a tool for imposing their will.

""We have gotten 25,000 complaints to the State of businesses that are in violation of the reopening plan—25,000 complaints,"" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo snarled in June. ""A bar or restaurant that is violating these rules can lose their liquor license. State Liquor Authority inspectors are out. We have a task force of State investigators who are out. You can lose your liquor license and that is a big deal for a bar or restaurant.""

Among the jurisdictions that have threatened or actually revoked licenses for businesses violating lockdown orders are New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Clark County, Nevada, to name just a small sample. The affected businesses include barbers, car washes, furniture stores, gyms, and smoke shops—all requiring government permission to legally operate.

But operating legally isn't the only way to do business.

""Good luck,"" Bob Martin, a 79-year-old barber in Snohomish, Washington, told officials when they said they were going to charge him $90,000 in fines for trimming hair after his license was pulled and in defiance of state closure orders.

Gym owners in Bellmawr, New Jersey, broke into their own establishment and resumed serving customers after authorities forcibly closed the place. ""The defiant owners of Atilis Gym kicked in plywood panels that had sealed the entrance to their Browning Road business since Monday, drawing cheers from a group of flag-waving supporters,"" reported the Courier-Post.

And, of course, there are those 800-plus bars in Texas, serving customers despite orders to the contrary.

Officials in Los Angeles have run into so much push-back that now they're threatening to cut water and power to businesses and homes that don't comply with lockdown orders. Depriving people of electricity and running water seems an unlikely means for improving public health, but officialdom is always more interested in compelling submission than in achieving reasonable outcomes.

But submission is harder to come by when the stakes are so high. The government is actually ordering people to refrain from earning their keep, and instead to humbly submit to bankruptcy and beggary. To some, submitting to the rules can look foolish and suicidal—like baring your throat to a predator.

And once you've battled government officials threatening your ability to make a living during hard times, why would you assume, after the crisis passes, that they've suddenly become wiser and better disposed to your wellbeing? People who have questioned officials' judgment and defied their orders are unlikely to lose that habit after the pandemic passes. Sure, they'll probably continue to apply for licenses to operate just to make life easy. But they'll remember that officials tried to strip them of the ""privilege"" of putting food on the table and they'll realize just how dangerous it is to rely on such permission.

It's too much to hope that the licensing and permitting apparatus that politicians have carefully constructed over the years will soon be swept away by a righteous wave of public revulsion. Big changes are hard and the permission state that we live in will, almost certainly, still formally exist in the years to come. But people aren't going to be so eager to ask permission, and they'll be much more willing to live their lives in its absence."	right

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden said Tuesday the conviction of former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin in the killing of George Floyd “can be a giant step forward” for the nation in the fight against systemic racism. But he declared that “it’s not enough.”

Biden spoke from the White House hours after the verdict alongside Vice President Kamala Harris, with the pair saying the country’s work is far from finished with the verdict.

“We can’t stop here,” Biden declared.

Biden and Harris called on Congress to act swiftly to address policing reform, including by approving a bill named for Floyd, who died with his neck under Chauvin’s knee last May. Beyond that, the president said, the entire country must confront hatred to “change hearts and minds as well as laws and policies.”

“‘I can’t breathe.’ Those were George Floyd’s last words,” Biden said. “We can’t let those words die with him. We have to keep hearing those words. We must not turn away. We can’t turn away.”

Harris, the first Black woman to serve as vice president, said racism was keeping the country from fulfilling its founding promise of “liberty and justice for all.”

“It is not just a Black America problem or a people of color problem. it is a problem for every American,” she said. “It is holding our nation back from reaching our full potential.”

“A measure of justice isn’t the same as equal justice,” she said.

Biden addressed the nation after telephoning Floyd’s family following the verdict, telling them, “We’re all so relieved.” He added later that he sought to comfort Floyd’s young daughter Gianna, telling her, “Daddy did change the world.”

After about 10 hours of deliberations over two days, the jury convicted Chauvin of two counts of murder and one of manslaughte r.

The verdict — and the aftermath — will be a continuing test for Biden. He has pledged to help combat racism in policing, helping African Americans who supported him in large numbers in last year’s election in the wake of protests that swept the nation after Floyd’s death and restarted a national conversation about race. But he also has long projected himself as an ally of police, who are struggling with criticism about long-used tactics and training methods and difficulties in recruitment.

Earlier Tuesday, Biden broke his administration’s silence on the trial, which has set the nation on edge for weeks, saying he was praying for “the right verdict.”

Speaking from the Oval Office while the jury was deliberating in Minneapolis, Biden said, “I’m praying the verdict is the right verdict. I think it’s overwhelming, in my view. I wouldn’t say that unless the jury was sequestered now.”

The president had repeatedly denounced Floyd’s death but had previously stopped short of weighing in on Chauvin’s trial, with White House officials saying it would be improper to speak out during active judicial proceedings. On Tuesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki repeatedly refused to explain Biden’s comments, doing nothing to dispel the impression that he thought Chauvin should be found guilty.

The White House had been privately weighing how to handle the verdict, dispatching specially trained community facilitators from the Justice Department in anticipation of potential protests, officials said. With word that a verdict had been reached Tuesday afternoon, Biden postponed planned remarks at the White House on his infrastructure package.

On Monday, Judge Peter Cahill, who presided over the trial, admonished public officials about speaking out while the trial was ongoing.

“I wish elected officials would stop talking about this case, especially in a manner that’s disrespectful to the rule of law and to the judicial branch and our function,” he said shortly after sending the jury to begin deliberations.

Defense attorneys often cite remarks made by public officials as a reason to appeal a verdict, in part because they could poison the jury against the defendant.

Cahill delivered his rebuke after rejecting a defense request for a mistrial based in part on comments from California Rep. Maxine Waters, who said “we’ve got to get more confrontational” if Chauvin isn’t convicted of murder. He conceded to Chauvin’s attorneys that Waters’ comments could potentially be grounds for an appeal.

On Monday, Cahill ordered that jurors be sequestered in an undisclosed hotel during their deliberations and instructed them to avoid all news about the case.

Despite Cahill’s remarks, Brock Hunter, a criminal defense attorney and past president of the Minnesota Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said he considered a successful appeal over remarks like Waters’ and Biden’s extremely unlikely.

“It’s inevitable that public officials are going to comment on a case and its impacts on communities,” he said. “Unless there is direct evidence that statements by a public official directly impacted a juror or jurors, I don’t think this even gets off the ground.”

On Capitol Hill, Republicans as well as Democrats said they were relived at the verdict and predicted it could give momentum to policing reform legislation that has been proposed in both the House and Senate.

“I think the verdict just reinforces that our justice system continues to become more just,” said Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only Black Republican senator. “This is a monumental day in many ways, in my opinion.”

The Congressional Black Caucus watched the verdict together in the Capitol, and members hugged and fist pumped after the verdict was read.

“The room was filled with emotion and gratitude,” said Georgia Rep. Hank Johnson. “Black lives mattered to this jury. And I’m very gratified at the verdict, very happy at the swiftness of the verdict. ... It’s a vindication of justice in America.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi joined the Black Caucus shortly afterward at a news conference outside, where she said she had spoken to Floyd’s family just before the verdict. She said she called “to say to them, ‘Thank you, God bless you, for your grace and your dignity, for the model that you are appealing for justice in the most dignified way.’”

jtfocr	libertarian	U.S. Justice Alito says pandemic has led to 'unimaginable' curbs on liberty	"(Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito said the COVID-19 pandemic had led to “previously unimaginable” curbs on individual liberty, singling out restrictions on religious events.

Slideshow ( 2 images )

The justice, who is seen as a conservative, told a meeting of the Federalist Society late on Thursday he was not underplaying the severity of the crisis or criticizing any officials for their response.

But he added: “We have never before seen restrictions as severe, extensive and prolonged as those experienced for most of 2020.”

""The COVID crisis has served as sort of a constitutional stress test,"" he said during his address over a video link for the conservative organization's annual conference bit.ly/2H21TvK.

Alito, who was appointed by Republican President George W. Bush in 2006, referred to restrictions on gatherings that had affected religious events.

“Think of worship services! Churches closed on Easter Sunday, synagogues closed for Passover in Yom Kippur”, he said.

“It pains me to say this,” Alito added, “but in certain quarters, religious liberty is fast becoming a disfavored right.”

The justice said freedom of speech was also under threat.

“Although that freedom is falling out of favor in some circles, we need to do whatever we can to prevent it from becoming a second-tier constitutional right,” he said.

Alito’s remarks on free speech echoed his words from 2016 at the same event when he referred to college campus culture that conservatives say stifles free speech to avoid offending political sensibilities on matters such as gender, race and religion.

Piloto, 40, says he is responding to the Communist government’s call for citizens to produce more of their own food, including in big cities, in whatever spaces they can find, from backyards to balconies.

Standing across from two giant ceiba trees that are considered sacred by many in Cuba, the temple usually resounds with ceremonies involving drumming, animal sacrifices and dance. But it sits empty now due to coronavirus lockdown restrictions on gatherings.

“I’m making the most of the earth,” said Piloto, leaning on his hoe.

Food security has lately risen to the top of the national agenda in Cuba, with countless news headlines and televised roundtable discussions dedicated to the topic.

“Cuba can and must develop its program of municipal self-sustainability definitively and with urgency, in the face of the obsessive and tightened U.S. blockade and the food crisis COVID-19 will leave,” José Ramón Machado Ventura, 89, deputy leader of the Cuban Communist Party, was quoted as saying by state-run media on Monday.

The Caribbean island imports roughly two-thirds of the food it consumes at a cost of around $2 billion annually, in addition to key farming supplies like fertilizer, machinery and animal feed.

But imports have nosedived in recent years as aid from ally Venezuela shrank following its economic implosion and U.S. President Donald Trump tightened the half century-old U.S. trade embargo.

That led first to shortages of imported food and then to drops in national agricultural production. Output of Cuban staples like rice, tomatoes and pork fell 18%, 13% and 8% respectively last year, according to data released this month.

The coronavirus pandemic, which has paralyzed the key tourism sector, has only exacerbated the situation.

“Today we Cubans have two big worries: COVID-19 and food. Both kill. We are flooded with scarcity,” said Yanet Montes, 51, leaving a popular Havana agricultural market with just a few mangoes.

She and others said the availability of produce at such markets was dwindling, with long lines for the most sought-after items like tarot root sometimes starting at dawn.

1990s SURVIVAL LESSONS

Leaders have appealed to Cubans to redeploy lessons learned during the so-called “Special Period,” the deep economic depression Cuba fell into after the 1991 collapse of former benefactor the Soviet Union.

Last year, they urged farmers to use oxen instead of tractors due to fuel scarcity.

The premium placed on fuel savings is one reason planning departments are now looking to expand organic farming in urban and suburban areas where goods can be sold directly.

Cuba became something of an organic farming pioneer in the 1990s, developing techniques like worm composting, soil conservation and the use of biopesticides, to replace imported supplies and large scale monoculture.

Havana now produces 18% of the agricultural produce it consumes, according to state run media.

Communist Party activists are signing up in some provinces to do voluntary work in the fields while authorities have distributed leaflets to neighborhood leaders in towns and cities on expanding family farming.

In a residential neighborhood in east Havana, Luis Ledesma asked his wife if he could tear up her flower beds so he could plant pumpkin, sweet potato, cassava, cucumber and chives.

“One of the things that is difficult to find these days is rice,” said the 61-year-old, who recently acquired five chickens and a cockerel and wants to install rabbit cages next. “But root vegetables can replace rice.”

REFORM

Some Cuba observers are cautiously hopeful the crisis will push the government to reform its agricultural model which, like the rest of the economy, remains heavily centralized.

“Nothing good can come from the combination of monopoly of supplies, monopoly of distribution and distorted prices,” said Cuban economist Pedro Monreal.

The government has hinted recently at a possible reform of the vast state network responsible for purchasing and distributing most farm output, which has come under fire for wasting crops and disincentiving production.

Another Cuban economist, Omar Everleny, said the government should free farmers altogether from this monopoly, allowing them to find their own ways to sell produce and import their own equipment.

“I have the impression in the next few months we will see new reforms,” he said.

Come what may, some Cubans like sustainable agriculture enthusiast Marnia Briones hope the country won’t lose the habits that have arisen from this and previous crises, which some have termed its “green revolution”.

“It’s great more people are planting but it cannot just be when there is a crisis,” said the Havana-based artist. “It should be fomented as a healthier lifestyle for the whole of humanity.”"	right

j37hur	libertarian	Google Searches For Libertarian Party Candidate Jo Jorgensen Spiked During The Debate	"Google searches for third party candidate Jo Jorgensen spiked during Tuesday night’s presidential debate despite Jorgensen not being on stage.

Google trends showed that searches for Jorgensen’s name increased rapidly during the debate, peaking after the debate was over at 10:48 PM. Searches began to increase sh0rtly before 9:00 when the debate began and dropped back down again after its peak. Jorgensen’s name was still searched for Wednesday at a higher rate than before the debate. (RELATED: The Debate Was So Wild, CNN’s Dana Bash Called It A ‘Sh*t Show’ Live On Air)

The graph uses a scale of 0 to 100 to measure the popularity of a search term at a given time. The peak popularity of a term is represented by a value of 100.

During the day Tuesday searches for Jorgensen remained between a 4 and a 10. They slowly began to increase around 8:00 PM, moving up to a 16 by the start of the debate. Between the debate’s start and end, searches for Jorgensen had sharply increased by 76 points.

Jorgensen’s name was searched for the most in North Dakota. Wyoming followed North Dakota as Jorgensen’s second-most popular state, followed by Maine, Indiana, and Kansas.

Jorgensen, who is running for president as a Libertarian, led a campaign called “Let Her Speak” which argued that Jorgensen should have been present during Tuesday night’s debate since she is on the ballot in all 50 states.

Tuesday’s debate was marked by continuous arguing between President Donald Trump, former Vice President Joe Biden, and moderator Chris Wallace, who talked over each other repeatedly throughout the night."	right
k127i9	libertarian	France bans citizens from filming and identifying violent police officers	"A French riot police officer clears a smoke flare thrown by protesters during a demonstration in Marseille, southern France, Nov. 21, 2020. Rights campaigners and journalists organizations were staging street protests in Paris and other French cities against a security bill that they say is a violation of the freedom of information.The proposed measure would create a new criminal offense of publishing images of police officers with intent to cause them harm. | Daniel Cole / AP

PARIS — Against a backdrop of street protest—even in the midst of a COVID lockdown—and increasing police violence and repression, France Tuesday passed the draconian Global Security Law which could make it an offense punishable by a year in jail and a 45,000 euro fine to film, post, and identify police officers committing violent actions.

The members of President Emmanuel Macron’s LREM party, whose title La République En Marche claims that they are concerned about rights and liberties, on Tuesday morning watched films of the police brutally rousting homeless people from Place de la République, the square commemorating these rights. On Tuesday afternoon they voted in favor of the law, claiming that there was no contradiction between the two events. Even the Minister of the Interior, Gérald Darmanin, in charge of police intervention, pronounced the use of force in this case “shocking,” while Macron’s own former speechwriter termed the sequence “hypocrisy without end.”

The event began Monday night with police roughly dismantling a homeless encampment at République, an event that was filmed by activists and widely broadcast. Militant defenders of the homeless then marched to Hôtel de Ville, the Paris City Hall, in protest, and were dispersed by police using tear gas. Also gassed and picked out as a target by police was a web journalist Rémy Busine, whose internet site Brut (Raw) has often featured police beatings, including those in République in 2016 of the movement Nuit Debout, or Up All Night, and of the Gilets Jaunes (the Yellow Vests), the people’s movement protesting the disenfranchisement of rural and peripheral areas. At the Trocadéro, across from the Eiffel Tower, on the weekend before the global security law was voted on, French journalists spoke out at a rally claiming that they were now vulnerable to jail and fines for simply covering demonstrations.

The law comes in the wake of a widely praised film on the police, whose French title translates to A Country Which Counts Itself Wise and whose English title is The Monopoly on Violence. The film opens with footage of a police lead ball hitting a Gilet Jaune in the eye and knocking him to the ground. We then see him with a patch over the eye which he has lost, commenting on the footage. The film consists of historians and sociologists asking why state violence is encouraged and pointing out that the gassing and beating of the Gilets Jaunes which has driven their protests out of the cities and stifled the movement, is done mainly by the national police force, reporting only to the minister of defense, divorced from any local contact, and separate from municipal police who must work on the terrain. The film is made up of mostly cell phone footage of police and demonstrator interaction and has been singled out by French critics for bringing a new vividness and a new style of shooting to the documentary. The director, David Dufresne, describes the way “the electronic eye enlarges the battle for truth.” Under the new law, the film could not have existed.

Police violence has increased under Macron. Official police statistics from last June identify the police as having wounded 2,448 marchers, having fired 19,071 lead balls or LBDs, and released 1,428 tear gas grenades. The effects of these weapons are documented by the website Allo Place Beauveau, named for the site of the French Interior Ministry, which counts 344 head wounds, 29 eye gougings, and 5 mangled hands. The use of LBDs, in particular, has been condemned by the European Council and by the United Nations Council on Human Rights, condemnations ignored by the current and past interior minister. The woundings are the result also of a recent policy of direct engagement with demonstrators where the police, instead of as before attempting to patrol the fringes of the march, now wade into the center and begin contesting those on the street.

The background to this increased contestation is the rampant inequality in both the suburbs, or banlieux, and the rural areas outside the global cities, the worsening of air pollution within the cities which has brought the Greens to power in many of them including Marseille, Bordeaux and Lyon, and the continued decline of small shopkeepers exacerbated by the COVID crisis. The country is known for its recalcitrant and battling working class and for the proclivity of its citizens to take to the streets to contest injustice, as was seen in the breaking of the COVID restrictions Saturday to protest against what the French are calling “liberticide,” the stripping away and systematic destruction of their rights, their liberté.

Macron, the Rothschild banker who came to power in 2017, was elected as a defender of liberties and bulwark against Marine Le Pen and the far-right National Front. Once in power, he began a merciless Reagan-Thatcher type neoliberal attack on working people, attempting to tame the French railroad unions by privatizing the railways, continuing to make it easier for employers to fire workers, and attacking the safeguards built up over years in the French pension system, all of which provoked massive resistance and protest.

He presented himself as an ally of the environmentalists, but the Green Party turned against LREM and instead made alliances with the often divided parties of the left in several major cities to win this year’s municipal elections. Since that moment, Macron, recognizing that the left is no longer amenable to his message, has tilted not only right toward the Republicans but also increasingly to the far right, setting himself up to take votes from both in his 2022 bid for reelection.

The Global Security Law is part of that right and far-right tilt, and it remains to be seen whether the majority of the French population will accept this trampling of the Enlightenment values of free speech and liberty of expression. Currently, four court cases hinge on citizen recordings of police violence, and if that right is denied, there will be few safeguards on a police force let loose on the populace."	right

President Donald Trump’s campaign requested a recount of votes in the Georgia presidential race on Saturday, a day after state officials certified results showing Democrat Joe Biden won the state, as his legal team presses forward with attacks alleging widespread fraud without proof.

Georgia’s results showed Biden beating Trump by 12,670 votes out of about 5 million cast, or 0.25%. State law allows a candidate to request a recount if the margin is less than 0.5%. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp formalized the state’s slate of 16 presidential electors.

The Trump campaign sent a hand-delivered letter to the secretary of state’s office requesting the recount in an election that has been fraught with unfounded accusations of fraud by Trump and his supporters.

A Trump legal team statement said: “Today, the Trump campaign filed a petition for recount in Georgia. We are focused on ensuring that every aspect of Georgia State Law and the U.S. Constitution are followed so that every legal vote is counted. President Trump and his campaign continue to insist on an honest recount in Georgia, which has to include signature matching and other vital safeguards.”

On Friday, in certifying the state’s electors , Kemp also brought up concerns about signatures. But Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has reiterated confidence in the results, and in a Saturday opinion piece in the Washington Post he said: “Georgia’s voting system has never been more secure or trustworthy.”

And in fact, the signatures on absentee ballot applications and envelopes are required to be checked when they are received.

Later Saturday, Raffensperger sent a written message to his deputy asking him to officially notify county election directors to prepare for the recount and to notify political parties so they could muster observers at the respective sites.

“This will be highly scrutinized so emphasize to the counties the importance of transparency and accuracy of the process,” Raffensperger said in his instructions to his aide.

The recount will be done using scanners that read and tabulate the votes. County election workers have already done a complete hand recount of all the votes cast in the presidential race. But that stemmed from a mandatory audit requirement and isn’t considered an official recount under the law.

State law requires that one race be audited by hand to ensure that the machines counted the ballots accurately, and Raffensperger selected the presidential race. Because of the tight margin in that race, a full hand count of ballots was necessary to complete the audit, he said.

Trump has criticized the audit, calling it a “joke” in a tweet that claimed without evidence that “thousands of fraudulent votes have been found.” Twitter has flagged the post as containing disputed information.

Votes that hadn’t previously been counted were found in several counties during the audit, which required recertification of the election results in those counties before state certification of the results."	right

For those that are unaware, key parts of the Patriot Act – namely the mass surveillance section – is currently unauthorized and needs to be reauthorized by Congress to stay in effect. The current bill under consideration to do that is called the US FREEDOM Reauthorization Act of 2020 and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has snuck in an amendment that would allow the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Department of Justice (DOJ) to seize internet search and browsing history if they claim it is tied to an active investigation. To try and stop this, Senators Wyden and Daines introduced their own amendment that would stop the FBI from being able to get that information without a warrant – as makes sense. That amendment needed 60 votes to pass, and only received 59 Wednesday afternoon.

k4k5uv	libertarian	LA County Supervisor dines at restaurant hours after voting to ban outdoor dining	"Protesters gathered outside the home of LA County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl on Tuesday after a FOX 11 report revealed hours after she voted to ban outdoor dining she dined outdoors herself.

Just hours after Los Angeles County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl voted to ban outdoor dining at L.A. County’s 31,000 restaurants over COVID-19 safety concerns, she visited a restaurant in Santa Monica, where she dined outdoors, FOX 11 learned on Monday.

RELATED: FOX 11 obtains exclusive photos of Gov. Newsom at French restaurant allegedly not following COVID-19 protocols

FOX 11 received multiple tips that shortly after her vote on Tuesday, Kuehl was seen dining outside at Il Forno Trattoria in Santa Monica, an Italian restaurant near her house that she has previously described as one of her 'favorite' restaurants.

When FOX 11 investigative reporter Bill Melugin stopped by the restaurant to ask about Kuehl’s visit, managers told him they “didn’t want to get involved”, and they have no comment.

A spokesperson for Kuehl provided FOX 11 the following brief statement:

“She did dine al fresco at Il Forno on the very last day it was permissible. She loves Il Forno, has been saddened to see it, like so many restaurants, suffer from a decline in revenue. She ate there, taking appropriate precautions, and sadly will not dine there again until our Public Health Orders permit.”

During Tuesday’s L.A. County Board of Supervisors meeting, Kuehl referred to outside dining as “a most dangerous situation” over what she described as a risk of tables of unmasked patrons potentially exposing their servers to the coronavirus.

“This is a serious health emergency and we must take it seriously,” Kuehl said.

“The servers are not protected from us, and they’re not protected from their other tables that they’re serving at that particular time, plus all the hours in which they’re working.”

Kuehl went on to vote in support of restricting outdoor dining in Los Angeles County, which passed by a 3-2 margin of the Board of Supervisors.

RELATED: LA County to suspend all in-person dining as COVID-19 cases surge

Kuehl’s visit to the restaurant came before the outdoor dining ban took effect Wednesday evening, but her decision is likely to draw criticism from those who have grown frustrated with elected officials taking a hypocritical approach to what they have preached, as Kuehl dined at the restaurant a mere hours after she said doing such a thing was unsafe and could contribute to the surge in COVID-19 cases.

L.A. County Supervisor Janice Hahn who strongly opposed the decision to ban outdoor dining reacted to our reporting tonight on FOX 11’s Special Report with Elex Michaelson.

""We have to remrnber that we who are in public office are held to a very high standard as we should be and one of the things I’m realizing with some of these new restrictions is if we can’t garner the trust of the public to be with us in this fight against the virus, then we’ve lost a big battle and I’m feeling that now nine months into this is we’re beginning to lose the trust of the public,"" Hahn said.

Michael Voltaggio is a local restaurant owner who is stunned by Kuehl’s decision.

“That sends a message that we’re getting direction from people that aren’t really believing in messages they’re making,"" he said.

Voltaggio tells FOX 11, ""For me it’s just proof of the continuous hypocrisy and just the lack of leadership and education as to what’s happening right now in this sort of shoot from the hip mentality that’s not doing anybody any good.”

Josiah Citrin also owns multiple restaurants across L.A. County.

Citrin said, ""I’m like wait a minute, restaurants are so dangerous, but you’re gonna go eat in a restaurant? I mean it just blows me away.""

Kuehl has declined our repeated requests for comment.

itjjnz	libertarian	Breonna Taylor died, and taxpayers are on the hook, not police	"When I think of the summer of 2020, I will always think of fire. The literal scorched earth in response to state violence, the burning rage against incessant injustice, the names of black victims that will be forever seared into my mind.

But while the fires have swirled throughout our cities, their flames have not been hot enough to incinerate the numerous laws and practices that uphold and protect our corrupt system.

On Tuesday, the city of Louisville, Kentucky, announced it had reached a $12 million settlement with Breonna Taylor’s family, a memorable and recent victim of policing gone wrong. But it’s important to remember that even when victims or their families receive settlements for wrongdoing (most don’t), that money comes from us — the taxpayers. We are the only ones on the hook for misconduct, and those actually responsible for it face little to no accountability.

In 2018, more than $85 million in taxpayer money went toward settling police misconduct lawsuits, along with an additional $28 million to outside defense attorneys. Not only is that a tremendous waste of our resources, the lack of consequences for violating our rights means there is no incentive for police to reform from within.

That’s in part thanks to the made-up court doctrine of qualified immunity , which shields government actors from civil liability in cases involving the deprivation of statutory or constitutional rights. While ignorance of the law is no excuse for breaking it as a citizen (and will get you no leniency in the courts), this doctrine turns that premise on its head for law enforcement and puts the burden of proof on a citizen to show that their rights were violated and that the actor had clearly established knowledge of such at the time of the offense.

Because of this doctrine, police are very rarely held accountable for misconduct in the field.

Despite numerous calls to arrest the cops involved in the Taylor case, only one has even been terminated, and charges remain unlikely . Qualified immunity isn’t the only reason for that, but it is a prominent one.

Taylor’s case involved gross negligence, incompetence, and disregard for human life. People are right to cry out for justice in the wake of such horrors.

In case you aren’t up to speed on the details, here is what we know . Taylor was a driven, hard-working, emergency medical technician. She had recently split from an ex-boyfriend, who was under investigation for selling drugs, and reunited with her straight-laced college boyfriend, Kenneth Walker. On March 13, Louisville cops executed a no-knock warrant on her home while she and Walker slept, all in an attempt to find drugs or cash proceeds from their sale.

Louisville police say they knocked that evening, and Walker backs that up. But according to him, they never responded to inquiries of who was at the door, and neighbors have confirmed they also heard no response. The police then knocked down the door, upon which Walker fired his legally owned and permitted firearm in self-defense. After that, police opened fire on the home and everyone in it, callously shooting at multiple residents (bullets were also found in a neighbor’s apartment). Taylor was shot eight times and died in her hallway floor. She was 26 years old.

The outdated “tough on crime” ideology has failed more colossally than almost any other (excepting various forms of collectivism). Yet, its practices are still heavily in use. No-knock raids are an implementation of the failed war on drugs. The claim is that police need to use them to surprise and apprehend dangerous offenders. In reality, they have mostly just gotten innocent people killed. It’s also important to recognize that no-knock raids put police needlessly in harm’s way, instigating violence where there is none previously occurring.

Anyone who claims to be a supporter of the Second Amendment should be outraged at the outright assault on our rights in scenarios such as this. Of course, if someone barges into your home in the middle of the night, you have a right to defend yourself. Yet, groups such as the National Rifle Association have been stone-cold silent, even as police initially tried to charge Taylor’s boyfriend for attempting to protect his own life.

It’s of note that police also tried to offer Taylor’s ex-boyfriend a lenient plea deal if he would implicate their victim in his drug business. He has continued to deny Taylor was involved.

It’s time for those who claim to stand for individual liberty, pro-life causes, and limited government to have a reckoning with the war on drugs and other failed, overreaching policies from the “tough on crime” era. These policies have only ever been tough on human rights. They create victims over nonviolent crimes. They needlessly put law enforcement in harm’s way. They waste billions. They ruin and take lives.

Criminal justice reform is already popular on both the Right and Left, but both sides need to double down in consistently pushing for a transformed justice system that eradicates these asinine practices. To really commit to reform means insisting on accountability for government actors within the system.

Right now, when police (government) actors violate us, we are the ones who pay. We pay with our tax dollars, we pay with our rights, and some of us pay with our lives. Instead of burning through our tax dollars, the doctrine of qualified immunity should be burnt to ashes and scattered to the wind.

jk8k7w	libertarian	SpaceX: No Earth-based government has authority or sovereignty over Martian activities	"SpaceX will not recognise international law on Mars, according to the Terms of Service of its Starlink internet project.

Elon Musk’s space company will instead reportedly adhere to a set of “self-governing principles"" that will be defined at the time of Martian settlement.

Musk revealed plans to create a self-sustaining city on Mars last week, though no timeframe is yet to be put in place for its development.

Any future colony created by SpaceX would likely use constellations of Starlink satellites orbiting the planet to provide internet connection to people and machines on the surface.

More than 800 of the internet satellites have already been launched into orbit around Earth, with tens of thousands more planned in the coming years.

A Starlink app launched in certain regions this week, following a successful beta test of the network’s capabilities in parts of the US and Canada.

Users noted that the terms of service within the app state that Starlink services provided to Earth or Moon will be governed in accordance with the laws of the State of California.

Beyond our planet and its satellite, however, the laws and regulations by which it will abide are less clear.

“For services provided on Mars, or in transit to Mars via Starship or other colonisation spacecraft, the parties recognise Mars as a free planet and that no Earth-based government has authority or sovereignty over Martian activities,” the governing law section states.

“Accordingly, disputes will be settled through self-governing principles, established in good faith, at the time of Martian settlement.”

Space systems engineer Erwan Beauvois said SpaceX’s position was reminiscent of a declaration put forward by the Earthlight Foundation, a non-profit organisation committed to preparing for the expansion of humanity beyond Earth.

The Declaration of the Rights and Responsibilities of Humanity in the Universe states that space should be “considered free, by all, for all and to all.”

m5n9hr	libertarian	The state of Pennsylvania will pay $475,000 to the estate of a man who died underneath a bulldozer that police had used to chase him for growing a handful of marijuana plants.	"READING, Pa. (AP) — The state of Pennsylvania will pay $475,000 to the estate of a man who died underneath a bulldozer that Pennsylvania State Police had used to chase him for growing a handful of marijuana plants, according to a settlement revealed in court Thursday.

Gregory Longenecker, a 51-year-old short-order cook and Grateful Dead fan, had fled into thick brush after being caught growing 10 marijuana plants on public land near Reading. His body was found under the treads of a Pennsylvania Game Commission bulldozer that state police had commandeered in pursuit.

The lawsuit by Longenecker’s family contended that state police and the game commission took “crazy and lethal action” against an unarmed man who posed no threat, then destroyed or withheld evidence to cover it up.

ADVERTISEMENT

The plaintiffs’ attorney, Jordan Strokovsky, said outside court Thursday that Longenecker’s family is pleased with the settlement but wants “sweeping reforms to prevent such an excessive show of force and tragedy like this in the future.”

A federal judge is reviewing the settlement and is expected to sign off.

A prosecutor who investigated Longenecker’s death concluded that troopers acted reasonably. Authorities have publicly contended that Longenecker was high on methamphetamine, crawled under the back of the bulldozer when it stopped briefly, and was crushed to death when it started moving again and made a left turn.

The lawsuit called that explanation ludicrous, and witness statements cast doubt on the official version of how he got caught under the machine .

Strokovsky demanded an investigation by the state attorney general’s office, accusing the Berks County district attorney’s office and state police of misleading the public.

“Rather than admit what happened and apologize for their excessive tactics ... state police, with the assistance of the Berks County district attorney’s office, disregarded evidence and provided a ridiculous and unfounded conclusion” to show that “law enforcement did nothing wrong,” Strokovsky said.

mj8stx	libertarian	Schumer says they will push for Cannabis legalization with or without Biden	"Even when states were for this, if [then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell wouldn't bring the bill up, their senators were never challenged: “How are you going to vote?” And they could say, “Well ... I don't know.” They don't have to say anything. And so the fact that every member will know once we introduce this legislation — not only that it has my support, but that it will come to the floor for a vote — is going to help move things forward in a very strong way.

What role does President Biden play in this? He does not support the full legalization of cannabis. Are you worried that he could veto this bill if it passes?

Well, he said he'd like to see more information on the issue. I respect that. I certainly will have an ongoing conversation with him, and tell him how my views evolved. And hope that his will to.

Will the Senate move forward even if the president's views do not evolve on this?

We will move forward. He said he's studying the issue, so [I] obviously want to give him a little time to study it. I want to make my arguments to him, as many other advocates will. But at some point we're going to move forward, period.

New York State will soon have a legal cannabis industry, and banking is going to be a big issue. The SAFE Banking Act has already been reintroduced in the Senate. Are you working with Banking Committee Chairman [Sherrod] Brown to move the SAFE Banking Act this Congress?

We've talked to the Banking Committee, and we certainly want to make sure that the communities that [have] most been affected by this — over the scheduling of marijuana — get some of the benefits here. But we have to figure out the right way to do that.

Chairman Brown has said that standalone cannabis legislation shouldn't move ahead of the comprehensive reform. Do you agree with that statement?

I would like to see it all move together, yes."	right
gj6cv1	libertarian	If This 'Doesn't Give You Chills I Don't Know What Will': McConnell Patriot Act Expansion Would Hand AG Barr Unprecedented Spy Powers	"Sen. Ron Wyden was joined by privacy advocates Wednesday in forcefully condemning a new proposed amendment to the PATRIOT Act put forward by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that would greatly expand the U.S. attorney general's surveillance powers under FISA.

McConnell's amendment, which the Senate began debating Wednesday as lawmakers took up the reauthorization of the 2001 PATRIOT Act, would explicitly permit the FBI to collect records of Americans' internet search and browsing histories without a warrant. It would also mandate that Attorney General William Barr, and his successors, conduct an annual review of the FBI's submissions into the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Court.

""It is open season on anybody's most personal information.""

—Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.)

Barr would be permitted to review for ""accuracy and completeness"" evidence presented to the FISA Court by the FBI regarding potential surveillance targets.

""Under the McConnell amendment, Barr gets to look through the web browsing history of any American—including journalists, politicians, and political rivals—without a warrant, just by saying it is relevant to an investigation,"" Wyden told the Daily Beast this week, before speaking out against the amendment on the Senate floor.

Mitch McConnell is forcing a Senate vote on his amendment to give Bill Barr warrantless access to Americans’ browsing history. I’ve heard a lot of bad ideas in my lifetime, but this is one of the worst. Tune in as I explain why: https://t.co/r53nm2HxzA — Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) May 13, 2020

""Typical Americans may think to themselves, 'I've got nothing to worry about, I've done nothing wrong. The government has no reason to suspect me of anything,'"" said the senator. ""Unfortunately, the question is not whether you did anything, the question is whether a government agent believes they have the right to look at your web searches... It is open season on anybody's most personal information.""

""If that doesn't give you chills I don't know what will,"" Wyden added on social media. ""I'm fighting it every step of the way.""

Evan Greer, deputy director of the digital privacy group Fight for the Future, was more succinct in her rejection of McConnell's proposal:

An amendment proposed by Wyden and Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), which would have required the Justice Department to show probable cause before collecting data under the PATRIOT Act, was voted down by one vote on Wednesday. Journalist Jeremy Scahill denounced 10 Democratic senators who joined the majority of Republicans in opposing the bill, as well as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who did not attend the vote.

Critics raised concern that the McConnell amendment would allow the Trump administration to spy on its political opponents, with Barr giving approval of evidence used to argue in favor of beginning surveillance.

Under the proposal, the FISA Court and its amicus—an attorney appointed to challenge the government's submissions for potential surveillance—would be limited in their ability to question the FBI's reasoning.

McConnell would limit the involvement of an amicus only when the FBI submits an application to ""targe[t] a campaign for federal office or an application that targets a United States person when the application relies for its criminal predicate on only the provisions of the Foreign Agents Registration Act.""

Sens. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) proposed an amendment which would require an amicus to challenge evidence presented for targeting ""a domestic religious or political organization,"" a ""domestic public official or political candidate,"" or their staff, according to The Daily Beast.

""Adversarial process is a cornerstone of our legal system,"" wrote Neema Singh Guiliani and Billy Easley of the ACLU this week. ""Americans expect that when the government makes a claim in a court of law that they aren’t the only voice heard in the courtroom.""

Critics said the amendment's provision allowing Barr—or any future attorney general—to review evidence presented to the FISA Court is likely a response to the FBI's reasoning for conducting surveillance on President Donald Trump's campaign aide, Carter Page.

Singh Giuliani told The Daily Beast it was ""bizarre"" to ""create an amicus to participate when targeting political candidates, but we're not going to provide that same oversight in cases involving religious organizations, domestic news media or everyday individuals who are facing new or significant civil rights concerns.""

""It's hard to look at that amendment and conclude it's intended to really address not just problems exposed by the Carter Page report but the subsequent IG audit,"" she added.

The progressive group Demand Justice called McConnell's provisions ""two of the most cynical attempts to undermine surveillance reform.""

""McConnell is literally trying to take a privacy safeguard designed for the press and religious groups and instead give it only to politicians and people suspected of being foreign agents. He's also trying to sneak warrantless surveillance of internet and search histories into an amendment that claims to prohibit it,"" Sean Vitka, senior policy council for the group, told The Daily Beast.

On Twitter, Wyden wrote that whistleblowers like Dr. Rick Bright and the anonymous person who disclosed the president's attempt to pressure the Ukrainian government into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden could be targeted for surveillance under Barr's expanded powers.

Bill Barr’s top priority as Trump’s AG is consolidation of power by unmasking anyone who makes his client look bad. If McConnell’s amendment to give Barr access to Americans’ browser history passes, whistleblowers are sure to be some of the first people Barr will target. https://t.co/83QZz0aRaS — Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) May 13, 2020

kagj96	libertarian	A Florida man who spent 31 years in prison for a nonviolent marijuana crime has been released	"(CNN) After spending 31 years in prison for a nonviolent marijuana crime, the man thought to be the longest-serving inmate convicted on cannabis charges in the US has been released.

Richard DeLisi, 71, was released Tuesday from the South Bay Correctional Facility in Palm Beach County, the Florida Department of Corrections confirmed to CNN.

He'd been incarcerated since 1989, when he was convicted on charges of racketeering, trafficking in cannabis and conspiracy, and sentenced to 90 years in prison for smuggling more than 100 pounds of marijuana from Colombia into Florida.

His release marks the first time in 32 years he hasn't been behind bars, according to the Last Prisoner Project, a nonprofit that advocates for releasing prisoners convicted on marijuana charges.

The Last Prisoner Project partnered with attorneys to push for the early release of DeLisi, whom they say is the country's longest-serving nonviolent cannabis prisoner. The group said the pandemic made his release even more urgent, citing his health and chronic health issues like asthma, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as factors that heighten his risk for severe illness or death from Covid-19. Attorneys with the group also stressed the nonviolent nature of his crime. Moreover, since his conviction, laws governing marijuana use in many states have changed dramatically, in some cases decriminalizing it for recreational use.

lavvyd	libertarian	Oregon law to decriminalize all drugs goes into effect, offering addicts rehab instead of prison	"PORTLAND, Ore. – For Janie Gullickson, rock bottom came both slowly and all at once.

A longtime drug and alcohol addict, Gullickson pushes back on the idea that one terrible day on the street leads to an epiphany and a climb back to normalcy. That’s what happens in movies, not real life.

“I lived in the bottom for years,” says Gullickson, 52. “For me and people like me, I laid there and wallowed in it for a long time.”

But if she has to pick the lowest point – one that lasted years, not days, she says – it came shortly after she hit 30 in 1998. At that time, Gullickson had five kids, ages 5 to 11, by four different men. She came home from work one day as a locksmith to find that her ex-husband had taken her two youngest and left the state. Horrified, devastated and convinced that this was the beginning of the end, her life spiraled: She dropped her other son off with his dad, left her two daughters with her mom and soon became an IV meth user.

Janie Gullickson, a recovering drug addict, was a chief petitioner of Measure 110, which decriminalizes all drugs in Oregon and will prioritize treatment over incarceration.

In prison six years later, Gullickson was contemplating joining an intensive recovery program when a “striking, magnetic gorgeous Black woman walked in the room, held up a mug shot and started talking about being in the very chairs where we were sitting,” Gullickson remembers. There was life on the other side of addiction and prison, the woman said. But you have to fight for it. Gullickson believed her.

“I remember thinking, I may not be able to do all that, be what she was, but maybe I could do something different than this,” Gullickson says. “That day, I felt the door open to change and healing.”

Now Gullickson, executive director of the Mental Health & Addiction Association of Oregon, is determined to give other addicts the same opportunity. That’s why she pushed for the passage of Measure 110, first-of-its-kind legislation that decriminalizes the possession of all illegal drugs in Oregon, including heroin, cocaine, meth and oxycodone. Instead of a criminal-justice-based approach, the state will pivot to a health-care-based approach, offering addicts treatment instead of prison time. Those in possession will be fined $100, a citation that will be dropped if they agree to a health assessment.

Story continues

The law goes into effect Monday and will be implemented over the next decade by the state officials at the Oregon Health Authority.

Advocates say the pivot will be life-changing for thousands of Oregonians.

“One of the things people misunderstand is how criminalization creates barriers to treatment,” says Kassandra Frederique, the executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, a national nonprofit dedicated to legalizing illicit drug use. “If we want people to make different choices, we have to give them more options ... ending criminalization will do leaps and bounds around ending shame, which automatically opens people up for other opportunities.”

Nationally, others are hopeful this could be the first in a wave of progressive measures that undo years of damage caused by drug criminalization, which disproportionately imprisoned people of color across the U.S.

“I hope that we all become more enlightened across this country that substance abuse is not something that necessitates incarceration, but speaks to other social ills – lack of health care, lack of treatment, things of that nature,” says Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., an outspoken critic of the War on Drugs. “If you’re white and wealthy, you get an opportunity to get a break, go home to your family and go into some kind of health care environment.”

But it's often different for people of color, Watson Coleman says. According to the Drug Policy Alliance, prosecutors are “twice as likely to pursue a mandatory minimum sentence for Black people as for white people charged with the same offense.” And many people of color do time for possession alone: In 2016, there were more than 1.5 million drug arrests. More than 80% were for possession only.

Watson Coleman also points out that it’s far more expensive to pay to incarcerate someone than get them treatment. Rehab programs not only empower people, she says, but they also save communities money.

'I will love you unconditionally always': Naomi Campbell pens moving tribute to godson Harry Brant after accidental overdose

In early 2020, the Oregon Health Authority announced a 10-year plan to limit health inequities across the state. Measure 110 will be a crucial step in that fight, says Steve Allen, the behavioral health director at the authority OHA.

Helping addicts fight addiction means more than just straight drug rehab, he says – addiction is rarely an isolated event, as people struggling with it are typically juggling other crises including mental illness, physical or dental health care issues, and homelessness. Too many people spend too much of their lives cycling in and out of jails and emergency departments, Allen says, instead of getting the wraparound services they need. A move to take care of the whole individual will pay huge dividends.

“What we know is that punishment for addiction doesn’t work, and doesn’t improve outcomes for people,” Allen says. He points out that the law is going into effect at a critical time: Since the COVID-19 pandemic started in spring 2020, overdoses in Oregon have skyrocketed by 70%.

The program will be paid for by redistributing existing marijuana dollars that come from the state’s cannabis tax, which Allen calls “a huge advantage” because it likely won’t be dependent on whims of the local economy (marijuana funds have gone up recently, he noted).

Advocates hope other states will follow

Gullickson, who has been sober since 2008 after a few detours, already sees a shift nationally in the conversation around addiction.

She points to the October 2020 presidential debate, when then-Democratic nominee Joe Biden said, “No one should be going to jail because they have a drug problem” and expressed support for drug diversion programs. Having Biden in the White House now “makes a huge difference” Gullickson says.

Frederique at the Drug Policy Alliance agrees and says the Biden administration’s promise to bring science back to the White House will play an important role going forward.

“We need to ground our policies in science instead of stigma and punishment,"" Frederique says.

Undoing Trump's policies: What Biden did in his first week as president

At the October presidential debate, then-Democratic nominee Joe Biden said, “No one should be going to jail because they have a drug problem,” and expressed support for drug diversion programs.

In 2018, as the House studied and voted on bills aimed at helping solve America’s opioid crisis, Watson Coleman introduced her own legislation that called for Congress to formally apologize for the war on drugs and acknowledge the damage it had done to communities of color. It also called for future drug policy to be ground in “evidence-based health care solutions.”

The war on drugs, Watson Coleman says, “was used as a weapon, as a tool to disrupt our communities. Particularly during the (Richard) Nixon era, it was a disguise to break up and weaken our communities … it wasn’t a war on drugs, it was a war on poor brown and Black men and women, and it did terrible things to families for generations.”

But she's optimistic change is coming. So is Gullickson, who's committed to helping in any and every way she can.

Now married and a grandmother of 17 – she’s slowly rebuilt relationships with almost all her children – Gullickson shares her story and all its warts because she wants others to know no matter how ugly or decimated their lives are now, something different is waiting for them.

She believes legislation like Measure 110 will create an environment where “instead of being somewhere accidentally and hoping someone will walk in and give you hope, we’re doing that proactively.” She knows it’ll take time to fully implement and there will be issues along the way. She also knows if it works, it could be implemented in other places and millions of other people like her, who once felt hopeless, alone and isolated could find something else, something good to live for.

“If we do this right in Oregon, I think there’s a will to do it everywhere,” she says. “We’ve got a huge responsibility to show that this is the right thing, and it can work.”

ijd6uf	libertarian	Federal Court: No, You Fucking May Not Force Your Way Into A Home And Strip Search Six Very Young Children	"Federal Court: No, You Fucking May Not Force Your Way Into A Home And Strip Search Six Very Young Children

from the fire-them-(out-of-a-cannon)-[into-the-sun] dept

The facts of this case are pretty ugly so let's just dive right into them. As Lenore Skenazy reported for Reason last year, two government employees decided a single incident of a mother leaving her kids in the car was all the reason they needed to swing by the house and strip-search every one of her six children. The oldest was five years old. The youngest were a pair of 10-month-old twins.

Holly Curry stopped at a shop to get some muffins and left her six children in the car while she ran in to get them. She was gone for less than 10 minutes. It was only 67 degrees outside. When she came back to her car, two police officers told her she shouldn't leave her kids in the car and wrote up a ""JC3 form"" -- a hotline-type alert that would be forwarded to Kentucky's Child Protective Services.

The next day a CPS investigator showed up. So did a sheriff's deputy. Here's what happened next:

The investigator insisted on taking the youngest child from Curry's lap and, without permission, began to undress her. In the presence of the male deputy, the investigator proceeded to undress each child, male and female, down to the genitals (removing the diapers of the two youngest). Curry tried to object, but she knew she was powerless to stop the investigator from doing full-body inspections. The last to be undressed was her 4-year-old son, taught by his pediatrician that he should never let a stranger take his clothes off without his mom's okay. But when the boy tried to make eye contact with Curry, the investigator stood directly in his line of sight, leaving him helpless. Then the investigator pointed to the deputy and said, ""Show that cop your muscles!"" The little boy removed his shirt and flexed his biceps as ordered. The investigator and deputy began laughing while the investigator started to pull down his pants. When the little boy finally was able to look back at his mother, she was holding back tears. The little boy's face registered shame and fear.

Two weeks after this strip search and questioning, the CPS investigation was closed as ""unsubstantiated."" Holly sued. And she has won. Qualified immunity has been denied to the CPS worker and deputy for their warrant entry and multiple strip searches.

The story is even worse than the earlier summation by Skenazy. This is from the decision [PDF]. It shows the CPS worker (Jeanetta Childress) intimidating Holly into ""consenting"" to a warrantless entry by her and Deputy Michael Furnish.

Childress and Furnish drove back to the Currys’ house. This time, Furnish knocked on the door. He was armed and in uniform. Again, Holly answered. Childress and Furnish told her they “needed to come in.” Again, Holly asked if they had a warrant. And again — when Furnish replied that they did not — Holly refused to let them in. Childress started yelling at Holly. Holly asked if they could reschedule the visit for when her husband was home. She also offered to bring the children to the door so Childress could see them. But Furnish and Childress would not agree to that. Instead, they both told her that if she didn’t let them in, they would get an emergency custody order. When Holly asked what this meant, Furnish told her, “We’ll come back and take all of your children.” Childress and Furnish both started yelling, “What’s it gonna be?” Holly started crying. She said, “Fine, we can do this.”

That led to even more officious bullshit.

Childress interviewed the two oldest children in a bedroom, separately, while Furnish waited in the hallway. Holly stayed with the rest of the children in another part of the house. At one point, Holly tried calling her husband, but Childress sat on her phone.

Then the social worker claimed she and the officer needed to check the kids for ""injuries."" Apparently, this involved inspecting the genitals of all six of Holly's children.

The court says the warrantless entry was illegal and no good faith or any other government excuse (like exigent circumstances) can save it. There were no exigent circumstances. The children were uninjured, accounted for, and in no apparent danger. Holly had no history with Child Protective Services that might demand a swift removal of her children. And both government workers knew they had nothing close to what they needed to obtain and execute an emergency custody order. Therefore, the entry was coerced. And in this circuit, this particular violation of rights has been clearly established for nearly a quarter-century.

In 1998, the Sixth Circuit held that an officer’s baseless threat to take a suspect’s child “constituted an objectively improper police action.” Thus, qualified immunity doesn’t shield either Childress or Furnish for entering the Currys’ home without a warrant.

The court says the same thing about the strip searches. Strip searches require probable cause and government employees better have a whole lot of it if they want to strip search minors. Neither person involved with these searches had anything resembling faint suspicion, much less probable cause.

Here, Childress lacked even a shadow of probable cause that the Currys physically abused their children. No one had ever reported physical abuse. There was no evidence of it. Nothing about their house indicated they lived in dangerous conditions. The children didn’t tell Childress anything that pointed to “a substantial chance” of physical abuse. In fact, the two oldest children told Childress that their parents didn’t even use corporal punishment. In Childress’s own words, Holly and her husband were “attentive and loving” parents.

This is so much of a violation the court doesn't even have to look for precedent.

If Childress did what the Currys allege, strip searching the children was clearly unconstitutional. Other Circuits have reached this conclusion in similar cases. Childress’s alleged actions were “so clearly” unconstitutional under Supreme Court precedent that we don’t need to find that “the very action[s] in question have previously been held unlawful” in this circuit. To hold otherwise would permit social workers to strip search children as a matter of course in every investigation.

Apparently this social worker believed the Sixth Circuit had already ""held otherwise.""

Incredibly, Childress repeatedly testified that she believed she should “automatically” strip search any child who was four or under.

Incredibly wrong.

The Constitution protects against that approach to children’s privacy, and no reasonable social worker could think otherwise.

The deputy may not have removed any of the children's clothing but he's still far from blameless. No qualified immunity for him either.

Had Furnish only witnessed the strip searches — rather than talk to the children during the search and encourage them to undress — he might be entitled to qualified immunity. The law is less clear about an officer’s liability when he is simply present while a social worker unreasonably strip searches a minor. But here, a jury could find that Furnish participated in the unconstitutional strip searches of the children. And as already stated, the law against those searches under these facts is so well-established that a reasonable officer would know that the searches here were unconstitutional.

The government will certainly waste taxpayers' money (and their patience) by appealing this decision. Few people enjoy being held accountable for their abusive actions but government employees tend to be the most resistant to personal responsibility. But for now, the decision stands and these two alleged public servants will have to continue being sued for threatening to take away someone kids before deciding a half-dozen strip-searched prepubescents was punishment enough for leaving kids locked safely in a car for 5-10 minutes on a cool day.

ibe94a	libertarian	Libertarian Mayor Casts Deciding Vote Decriminalizing Marijuana in Plymouth Ohio	"Plymouth, OH 7/28/2020- Marijuana is now decriminalized in Plymouth, Ohio. That means there will be no monetary incentive to enforce marijuana related infractions. Taking away the fine discourages enforcement of the draconian state law.

The ordinance passed in a 4-3 vote with Libertarian Mayor Cassaundra Fryman being the deciding vote. Mayor Fryman, who introduced the ordinance, said in her impassioned speech to the council “I want Plymouth to be seen as receptive to change, moving in a direction of economic and cultural modernization, and most importantly, restoring bodily autonomy to our community.”

Plymouth is one of many cities and townships passing local ordinances because the state refuses to act. Marijuana related offences cost a lot of tax dollars to prosecute and a large percentage of our jails are filled with people convicted of these non-violent crimes. The hope with these ordinances is to show the state that Ohio is ready for full and immediate legalization of marijuana.

Cassaundra Fryman is a Libertarian and started her term 01/01/2020. She hopes to continue working with the city council to bring more liberty to her constituents.

irctvb	libertarian	In Chicago, where 2,858 people have been shot this year, 951 more than 2019, the elected officials are concerned about vaping. Please consider voting third party.	"The Chicago City Council voted overwhelmingly to pass an ordinance Wednesday that would ban the sale of flavored vaping products within city limits, a move officials say is designed to keep young people from beginning to use the products.

According to a press release, the ordinance specifically targets “liquid nicotine products that create the taste of, or aroma of, menthol, mint, wintergreen, chocolate, vanilla, cocoa, candy or dessert,” among other flavored-additives.

“With flavors like candy and chocolate, these products are designed to entice youth, and we as a city have a responsibility to do everything we can to prevent that from happening,” Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a statement.

According to Dr. Allison Arwady, director of the Chicago Department of Public Health, smoking among teens is at an historic low, but the use of vaping products has been on the rise in the city.

“The growing vaping epidemic is unacceptable, as are the increasing inequities in tobacco use,” she said. “To advance health and equity, we must keep going.”

Lightfoot said that her administration believes that flavored-vaping products are designed to get young residents “addicted to nicotine.”

“We made a hugely important step in keeping our residents, particularly our young people, healthy with the City Council’s vote to ban the sale of flavored vaping products in Chicago,” Lightfoot said. “These products, no doubt about it, are designed to get our young people hooked. The tobacco industry is looking for its next generation of people who are addicted to nicotine, and we as a city have a responsibility to do everything that we can to keep that from happening.”

Lightfoot says that the city has committed itself to “further action on vaping and tobacco,” and will announce more initiatives in the coming weeks and months.

Even with city officials saying that vaping rates among teens are on the rise, new data released by the federal government suggests that vaping usage among teenagers is actually on the decline. According to the survey, just under 20% of high school students said they were “recent users of electronic cigarettes and other vaping products.”

That is a large decline from a similar survey released in 2019, which found that 28% of high school students said they had recently vaped. This year, 5% of middle school respondents said they had used vaping products, compared to 11% last year.

The survey, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, polled more than 20,000 middle and high school students, according to the report."	right
mmqlt8	libertarian	Virginia becomes first Southern state to legalize marijuana	"Virginia became the first Southern state to legalize marijuana Wednesday, as lawmakers voted to approve Gov. Ralph Northam’s proposed changes to a bill that will allow adults to possess and cultivate small amounts of the drug starting in July.

Northam sent the bill back to lawmakers substantially changed from the version that squeaked out of the General Assembly in February. The amendments lawmakers agreed to Wednesday would accelerate the timeline of legalization by about three years, well before retail sales would begin, a move that’s been cheered by racial justice advocates.

“The time has come for our state to legalize marijuana. The amendments ensure that while we’re doing the complicated work of standing up a commercial market, we aren’t delaying immediate reforms that will make our Commonwealth more equitable for all Virginians,” House Majority Leader Charniele Herring said in urging her colleagues to approve the governor’s changes.

Democrats said the bill was a matter of urgency, a necessary step to end what state figures show is disparate treatment of people of color under current marijuana laws.

Northam’s amendments cleared the House 53-44 with two abstentions during a one-day session held for the purpose of putting the finishing touches on the year’s legislation. In the Senate, lawmakers deadlocked 20-20 and Democratic Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax broke the tie, voting to approve the changes.

Virginia Lt. Gov., Justin Fairfax, left, speaks with new state Sen. Travis Hackworth (R-Tazewell) during the Senate reconvene session in Richmond. AP

The final version of the legislation would allow adults 21 and up to legally possess up to one ounce (28.3 grams) of cannabis without the intent to distribute beginning July 1. It also would allow the home cultivation of up to four plants per household beginning July 1. Public use of the drug will be prohibited.

“This is not going to generate some ganjafest at Jiffy Lube pavilion out in the parking lot, because that is smoking in public. Just like you can’t drink in public, you can’t smoke in public under this,” Democratic Sen. Scott Surovell said.

It will be years before legal retail sales follow legalized possession. The bill lays out the complex process of creating a new state agency to oversee the marijuana marketplace, with sales beginning and regulations taking effect on Jan. 1, 2024.

Many parts of the bill dealing with the regulatory framework will have to be reapproved by lawmakers next year. The possession and cultivation pieces will not.

Republicans, who overwhelmingly opposed the bill when it initially went through the General Assembly, railed against the latest version, citing several reasons.

Virginia State Sen. Bryce Reeves (R-Spotslyvania) addresses the Senate during debate on a bill legalizing marijuana during the reconvene session at the Science Museum of Virginia in Richmond. AP

GOP Del. Chris Head called the bill “a train wreck.”

“The hard-fought compromise that barely made it out of this chamber and over to the Senate has just been discarded. And why is that? It’s because some activists want marijuana legalized and they want it legalized now, consequences be damned,” he said.

Some Republicans took issue with labor provisions in the new version of the bill, in particular a change that says the government can revoke or suspend licenses issued under the new law in cases where an employer has refused to “remain neutral regarding any union organizing efforts by employees.”

During the legislative session, the Senate sought to legalize simple possession beginning in July, but House Democrats argued that legalization without a legal market for marijuana could promote the growth of the black market. The bill as passed in February would not have legalized simple possession until 2024.

Virginia State Senate Majority Leader Richard Saslaw, center, along with Sen. John Cosgrove left, talk with Sen. Travis Hackworth during the Senate reconvene session. AP

Herring said Wednesday that home cultivation would give Virginians a way to legally acquire cannabis while the retail market is being put in place.

Many of the other amendments lawmakers dealt with Wednesday were minor or technical in nature and dispensed with more easily. Both chambers quickly signed off on a tweak to a sweeping voting rights measure that supporters say will protect and expand access to the ballot box. And they approved minor changes to a measure intended to improve the beleaguered unemployment system.

They also approved amendments that will allow both a gun ban on Capitol Square as well as one of the most restrictive bans in the country on the use of facial recognition technology to go into effect.

Both chambers signed off on a budget amendment from Northam that will fund an outside investigation into a small component of a larger controversy over the state parole board. Republicans blasted the governor’s proposal as far less substantive than necessary and said it would allow the administration to keep quiet any unflattering findings.

Lawmakers also rejected a handful of the governor’s proposed amendments. Those measures now go back to Northam, who can either sign the bills as they passed or veto them.

The General Assembly had no veto overrides to consider this year.

Northam said in a statement that this year’s legislative session would be regarded as “one of the most consequential policy-reforming periods in modern Virginia history.”

kxislo	libertarian	Massive Illinois Police Reform Bill Ends Cash Bail, Limits Deadly Force, Mandates Body Cameras, and Makes It Easier To Dump Crooked Cops	"Illinois lawmakers have kicked off the new year with a massive policing reform bill. It will eliminate the use of cash bail, limit the use of deadly force, improve reporting of deaths in police custody, mandate the use of body cameras, and make it easier to decertify and fire officers who engage in misconduct, among other things.

The bill, H.B. 3653 was passed Wednesday by the state Senate and then early Thursday morning by the state's House. Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker has praised the bill, so it seems likely he'll sign it into law.

The bill is lengthy—more than 700 pages—and touches many areas of policing:

It creates a process for the state's attorney general to take a law enforcement officer to civil court if that officer has violated a person's civil rights and to seek financial damages, with a cap of $50,000. An earlier version of the bill would have stripped police officers of qualified immunity when they've been found to violate a person's rights, thus allowing individuals to sue officers in civil court, but that was removed from the final version of the bill.

It mandates body cameras for all police officers in the state, with compliance deadlines staggered across the next four years.

It establishes that after January 2023, monetary bail will be abolished within the state. Instead, people arrested for crimes will be evaluated with a goal of releasing them with only enough pretrial conditions to ensure they make it to subsequent court appearances and don't commit crimes while on release. Full detention will be ordered only ""when it is determined that the defendant poses a specific, real and present threat to a person and has a high likelihood of willful flight."" The court may use a risk assessment tool to evaluate the defendant, but the score cannot be the only reason why a defendant is denied pretrial release—and the defendant must be provided the information, so that he or she may challenge it. There are many exceptions to the orders for pretrial release, including defendants accused of stalking and domestic violence, many firearm-related crimes, human trafficking crimes, or any forcible felony that comes with a mandatory minimum prison sentence. Even in these cases, however, a court must determine that the defendant is too dangerous to be released.

It establishes a new class 3 felony of law enforcement misconduct, with a possible sentence of two to five years in jail. This will cover officers who misrepresent facts during an investigation, withhold knowledge of misrepresentation by other officers, or fail to comply with state laws or department policies on body-worn cameras.

It allows cities with populations greater than 100,000 to require that police live within city limits. Current law only permits this for cities with population greater than 1 million.

It allows other first responders besides police to direct people they encounter with substance abuse problems toward treatment programs, without requiring an arrest.

It allows funds for police and first responders to carry naloxone and similar supplies that can reverse opioid overdoses.

It prohibits law enforcement agencies from requesting or receiving excess military equipment, such as armored vehicles, large-caliber guns, or grenade launchers.

It prohibits retaliation against whistleblowers, a problem that has come up repeatedly when people try to expose misconduct in the Chicago Police Department.

It demands that all records connected to complaints against police officers and investigations of police officers be retained permanently.

It adds crisis intervention and de-escalation training to the curriculum for new police officers and to mandatory training every three years.

It requires the state police to participate in and provide data to the FBI's National Use of Force database.

It amends the police disciplinary process system so that officers under investigation are not provided the names of those filing the complaint, and so that it is no longer a requirement for people to provide their names in order to file a complaint about police misconduct. The Illinois Law Enforcement Training Standards Board is authorized to perform the preliminary review to see if there is evidence that supports the anonymous complaint.

It halts the practice of suspending driver's licenses for failure to pay traffic citations or abandoned vehicle fees.

It amends the definition of resisting or obstructing a police officer to require that, in order to arrest and individual for resisting arrest, there must be an underlying offense for which the person was subject to arrest. No more charging people only with resisting arrest.

It forbids the use of deadly force against people who are a danger only to themselves, and it forbids the use of deadly force against those suspected of committing only property offenses (except in cases of terrorism). The new rules require that deadly force be used only ""when reasonably necessary in defense of human life."" It also explains that ""merely a fear of future harm"" is not enough to reach this threshold. That's an important distinction, because many defenses of police shootings of unarmed suspects revolve around the officers claiming that they feared the suspect was armed.

It forbids chokeholds and neck restraints and forbids the use of force as punishment or retaliation. It forbids the use of non-lethal weapons in a manner that targets the head, pelvis, or back, and it forbids firing non-lethal weapons indiscriminately into crowds. It also forbids using irritants like tear gas against crowds unless police have both ordered the crowd to disperse and given it enough time to do so.

It establishes a duty to render aid to anybody police encounter who is injured (or anybody they injure) and an affirmative duty to intervene when they witness another police officer using unauthorized force. Retaliation against an officer who intervenes in this fashion is forbidden.

It calls for the citation and release rather than the arrest of anybody accused of traffic offenses, petty offenses, or low-level misdemeanors, unless they pose an obvious threat to others or themselves.

It establishes that all police officers must be certified to perform as law enforcement by the state's Illinois Law Enforcement Training Standards Board. It gives the board the authority to suspend an officer's certification immediately if the officer has been arrested or indicted on felony charges. A panel will hear the officer's case and can decide whether to maintain or reverse the officer's suspension of certification.

It orders the creation of a searchable database of law enforcement officers, available to the public, showing each officer's certification status and any sustained complaints of misconduct.

This is a lot of reform to pack into one bill, and it's going to take some time to see how it all plays out. The bail reforms appear to be following the same steps as New Jersey, which has mostly eliminated the use of cash bail, without making the mistake California did of giving judges too much leeway to deny pretrial release. Judges will still call the shots for the rules of pretrial release in Illinois, but as in New Jersey the law establishes a presumption of release and forces the court to document why somebody is too risky to be released.

Those distinctions matter because the purpose of reforming bail is to make sure that risk, not money, determines whether somebody is detained before trial. America has about half a million people stuck in pretrial detention, many of whom are not dangerous to the public but simply cannot afford the cost of bail. People who are unable to earn pretrial freedom typically end up accepting worse plea deals and get harsher sentences than somebody able to address the charges outside of jail.

But if judges aren't given the right tools to assess risks, the reforms can backfire and leave more people detained without any option of being released, since cash bail is no longer permitted. In Baltimore, poorly implemented reforms have led to an increase in people being released on their own recognizance, which is good, but also an increase in the number of people detained with no prospect of pretrial release, which is bad.

As for the risks when more people are released before trial: The evidence is preliminary, as many of these reforms are so new, but a reduction of bail demands in Chicago's Cook County found that increasing the number of people freed from detention did not contribute to crime increases.

It's unfortunate that reforms to qualified immunity were cut from the bill, but the legislation does call for a task force to explore possible changes in that area. Qualified immunity has been abused to protect police officers (and other government officials) from civil liability when they abuse citizens. Curtailing or eliminating qualified immunity would make cops think twice about beating people up for no good reason.

But even without that reform, police interests are screaming bloody murder, by which I mean they're saying you'll be bloody murdered if you restrain the police state. The Illinois Law Enforcement Coalition claims the bill ""ties the hands of police officers while pursuing suspects and making arrests, and allows criminals to run free while out on bail. The legislation includes no way to pay for any of these law-abiding citizen-threatening measures, so taxpayers will have to pay extra for the privilege of being crime victims.""

Well, let us know when it approaches the hundreds of millions of tax dollars being spent to pay settlements for police abuses just in Chicago alone."	right

kd9yvk	libertarian	Police Say Seizing Property Without Trial Helps Keep Crime Down. A New Study Shows They’re Wrong.	"ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.

In 2015, New Mexico lawmakers unanimously passed a bill to all but end civil asset forfeiture, the process that lets police keep cash or property they seize, even if they never charge the owner with a crime, so long as they suspect that it’s linked to criminal activity. High-profile lawsuits and press attention had prompted some states to reexamine their forfeiture laws.

Law enforcement officials howled in outrage. In New Mexico, sheriffs and prosecutors implored the governor to veto the legislation. Eliminating civil forfeiture, they argued, would hand the bad guys a win and put public safety at risk. “You’ll get less law enforcement,” predicted the chair of the state sheriffs’ association, Ken Christesen, who noted that police departments use forfeitures to help fund their budgets. (The bill still allowed forfeiture, but only through criminal court, which imposes a much more stringent burden of proof on prosecutors than its civil counterpart.)

Get Our Top Investigations Subscribe to the Big Story newsletter.

Criminal organizations would grow richer and more powerful, Christesen warned, if they got to hang on to the cash, cars and other property police could no longer seize from them. “The end result of this,” he said, “is the cartels are going to ramp up their money laundering and cash exchanges in the state of New Mexico tenfold.” The governor, Susana Martinez, wasn’t persuaded, and she signed the bill into law.

Now, five years after New Mexico effectively banned civil forfeiture, those fears remain unrealized, according to a new study set to be published on Tuesday by the Institute for Justice, a public interest law firm that has been advocating reforms to forfeiture laws. The predicted rise in crime and drop in arrests has not materialized, according to the study, which is based on analyses of FBI data. Arrest and offense rates in New Mexico, the study found, remained essentially flat before and after the 2015 law went into effect. That’s based on an examination of crime overall, as well as a specific set of offenses: drug possession, drug sales, and driving under the influence. Arrest and offense rates were also consistent with trends in two neighboring states, Colorado and Texas.

Nor, the study shows, are civil forfeitures key to cutting off the flow of millions of dollars to major fraudsters and criminal enterprises, as defenders of the practice often claim. Bernie Madoff, the notorious Ponzi schemer, was the principal example of the virtues of civil asset forfeiture in a 2017 op-ed in The Wall Street Journal by Rod Rosenstein, then the second most senior official at the Justice Department. He hailed the fact that $3.9 billion had been recovered and was being returned to Madoff’s victims. Rosenstein also cited a case in which $48 million was seized from drug couriers and another in which “millions” were recovered from a $110 million Medicare fraud.

The new Institute for Justice study tells a different story. The median forfeiture averaged $1,276 across the 21 states where usable data was obtainable. In most of those states, half of cash seizures fell below $1,000. In Michigan, for example, half of all civil forfeitures of currency were worth less than $423, and in Pennsylvania, that median value was $369. (The analysis was limited to currency seizures because valuations of other kinds of property, such as cars, depend on subjective appraisals, which may not be reliable.)

“That’s not drug dealer money,” said Jenny McDonald, a senior research analyst at the Institute for Justice who authored the study. She said she and her colleagues expected the figures to be low, but “just how low they were shocked even us.”

Civil forfeiture is often used to target ordinary people stopped for minor infractions, like traffic violations, where police purport to have a basis to suspect the money is connected to some kind of criminal act. Police officers have seized people’s cars after finding a small amount of marijuana or when a drug-sniffing dog indicated that drugs were once present in a car.

Police sometimes target family homes, too. In 2013, ProPublica reported on how prosecutors in Philadelphia sought to seize the houses of often lower-income residents simply because a child or other relative had sold small amounts of drugs while living there. Some of those families spent years in court fighting to save their homes. (The city has since reformed its civil forfeiture system after Institute for Justice lawyers filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of city residents.)

One incentive for police to target lower-dollar seizures is that they’re not worth challenging in court. The cost of hiring a lawyer — and sometimes even the court filing fee — may well exceed the amount of money at issue. The Institute for Justice found that, in the four states that track such data, one-fifth or fewer of the people involved sought the return of their property. In Colorado, only 1% of forfeitures were challenged.

The new study — the third, and most comprehensive, edition of a report titled “Policing for Profit” — is built on data acquired through hundreds of public records requests to state and federal agencies, many of which maintain only limited statistics on forfeitures. That lack of transparency can obscure abusive practices not only from the public but even from state and local officials.

As for Rosenstein’s claim about how forfeiture funds are disbursed, the Institute for Justice found that the U.S. Justice Department spends less than a third of what it brings in from civil forfeiture on compensating victims and other third parties. Some states mandate spending on victim compensation. But in at least six of the 15 states that disclose data on how forfeiture funds are spent — including Florida, Illinois, Oregon and Utah — none of the money obtained by civil asset forfeiture went toward paying back victims of crime for what they lost. The other nine states either use negligible amounts to compensate victims or do not specify whether any money goes to victims.

Instead, law enforcement directed the money mostly toward salaries, equipment and other operational expenses. For some law enforcement agencies, forfeiture funds have accounted for as much as 20% of their budgets, and are sometimes used for seemingly nonessential purchases. A police department in Georgia, for example, once spent $227,000 on an armored personnel carrier, and a sheriff in New Mexico splashed out $4,600 for an awards banquet. In one recent case, a suburban Atlanta sheriff spent $70,000 in forfeiture funds on a muscle car, a Dodge Charger Hellcat, that he uses solely to drive to and from work. The U.S. Justice Department called that purchase “extravagant.”

The U.S. Supreme Court has shown an interest in civil asset forfeiture in recent years. In 2017, Justice Clarence Thomas expressed doubts about whether civil forfeiture practices “can be squared with the Due Process Clause and our Nation’s history.” The following year, in a case litigated by the Institute for Justice, the high court ruled that the prohibition on excessive fines enumerated in the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution applies to state-level civil asset forfeiture procedures.

At the same time, unified opposition by law enforcement has limited and even scuttled reform efforts, and there’s reason to believe the coming years may see police pursue civil forfeiture aggressively. Activists protesting police brutality have pushed since this summer, with some success, to have cities reduce law enforcement funding, and state and city budgets nationwide are facing severe strain in the coming years, hit hard by the economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. A 2019 study by an economics professor at Seattle University, published in collaboration with the Institute for Justice, suggests a link between funding constraints and forfeiture practices. When budgets tighten, the study found, police tend to pursue civil asset forfeiture with greater vigor."	right
hvjapt	libertarian	Rand Paul: It's Time To Demilitarize the Police | The line between peace officer and soldier of war has become far too blurry.	"In a free society, citizens should be able to easily distinguish between civilian law enforcement tasked with keeping the peace in our communities and the armed forces tasked with protecting our country from foreign adversaries.

Unfortunately, thanks to the federal government flooding our neighborhoods with billions of dollars of military equipment and property over the years, the line between peace officer and soldier of war has become increasingly blurry.

Police officers have an incredibly difficult and often thankless job where they lay their lives on the line every day. Without the rule of law, a civilized society cannot exist, and our officers deserve our gratitude. The horrific actions of a few bad actors should not erase all the good done by the vast majority of these brave and hardworking men and women.

But as the federal government has enabled our local police to become more and more militarized, it has placed them in greater danger by eroding the community trust crucial to doing their jobs well.

While I respect the determination to preserve law and order, sending in federal forces to quell civil unrest in Portland further distorts the boundaries, results in more aggression (including pepper-spraying and repeatedly striking a Navy veteran whose injured hand will need surgery), and has led to reports we should never hear in a free country: federal officials, dressed in camouflage, snatching protesters away in unmarked vehicles.

Sending the feds into Chicago won't make the situation there any better, either.

Nothing you'll read here excuses the actions of those who have destroyed lives and property in a mockery of peaceful protest—actions I have condemned. But many of us have been inspired by seeing protesters confronting these rioters, making the difference between righteous cause and opportunistic destruction even more stark.

Restoring lost trust is essential to reducing the tension and returning to peace. This means stopping the federal militarization of our local law enforcement and keeping federal agents and troops on the national posts where they best serve our country.

According to the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), which operates within the Department of Defense, ""More than $7.4 billion worth of property"" has been transferred to law enforcement through the Law Enforcement Support Office (LESO) program. DLA also reveals that ""as of June 2020, there are around 8,200 federal, state and local law enforcement agencies from 49 states and four U.S. territories participating in the program.""

Back in 2014, NPR reported the federal government had sent out 79,288 assault rifles, 205 grenade launchers, and 11,959 bayonets from 2006–2014.

Yahoo recently reported that ""the California Highway Patrol received what appeared to be a drone worth $22 million in 2016. The Howell Township Police Department in New Jersey received an MRAP [mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicle] worth $865,000 in 2016. An MRAP provided to the Payne County Sheriff Office in Stillwater, Oklahoma, cost $1.3 million.""

As the Senate debates the latest National Defense Authorization Act, I joined a bipartisan group of senators to introduce an amendment based on my Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act, which I originally introduced with Sen. Brian Schatz (D–Hawaii) in 2015 and have reintroduced in each session of Congress since.

Our amendment would have limited the transfer of certain offensive military equipment including bayonets, grenade launchers, and weaponized drones—all without prohibiting the continued distribution of defensive equipment, such as body armor.

It would also have ensured that communities are notified of requests and transfers by posted notices throughout the area and on a public website, and it would have required that a jurisdiction's governing body approves of the transfers.

Though the Senate voted against these common-sense changes, my standalone legislation goes even further to reform the system, and I will keep working to advance it through Congress.

Our bipartisan approach takes seriously the idea that cops on the beat can only do their jobs well when they are well-known by their neighbors and trusted by their communities.

The Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act will help build that relationship, making our citizens, police, and neighborhoods safer."	right
k9uib2	libertarian	Feds to investigate after a sheriff's deputy killed a Black man entering his own home in Columbus, Ohio	"(CNN) A sheriff's deputy working for a fugitive task force shot and killed a Black man trying to enter his own home in Columbus, Ohio, last week in a case that is now being investigated by federal authorities.

Casey Goodson, 23, was fatally shot on Friday by a 17-year veteran of the Franklin County Sheriff's Office, identified as deputy Jason Meade. Meade was working for the US Marshal's fugitive task force looking for violent offenders at the time, but Goodson was not the person being sought by the task force, Columbus Police said.

Goodson had put his keys into his door before he was shot and fell into the kitchen, where his 5-year-old brother and his 72-year-old grandmother saw him lying on the ground with a Subway sandwich, family attorney Sean Walton told CNN.

Goodson, an Ohio concealed carry permit holder, was legally armed at the time of the shooting, according to the Columbus Division of Police. Goodson was not alleged to have committed any crimes, has no criminal background and was not the target of any investigation, Walton told CNN.

During the US Marshal's task force operation in Columbus, Meade reported seeing a man with a gun and was investigating the situation when there was reportedly a verbal exchange prior to the shooting, the Columbus Division of Police said.

According to police, no other officers witnessed the shooting, no civilian eyewitnesses have been identified and there is no body camera footage of the actual shooting because Franklin County Sheriff's task force officers aren't issued body cameras.

CNN reached out to the Franklin County Sheriff's Office for comment but has not yet heard back.

Walton called on authorities to provide the family answers and said that the officer involved should be held accountable.

""At this point, witness testimony and physical evidence raise serious concerns about why Casey was even confronted, let alone why he was shot dead while entering his own home,"" Walton told CNN.

In a statement, Walton said Goodson was ""an amazing young man whose life was tragically taken.""

""Even hours after his death, the keys that he used to let himself in the house as he was shot and killed hung in the door -- a reminder to his family of how close he was to safety,"" the attorney noted.

Federal and local authorities investigate

Even though the shooting did not involve a Columbus Police officer, the Columbus Police Critical Incident Response Team is the primary agency investigating the shooting because it occurred in Columbus.

That investigation will examine whether Meade was legally justified in shooting Goodson, according to Columbus Police . Once the investigation is complete, the evidence will be turned over to the Franklin County Prosecutor to be presented to a grand jury, police said.

In addition, the US Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio and the FBI are launching a federal civil rights investigation.

""This offers the highest level of transparency and a clear path to the truth,"" Columbus Police Chief Thomas Quinlan said.

Columbus Police had on Monday attempted to turn over the investigation to the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI), the state agency that typically investigates police-involved shootings. But the BCI announced that they would not be able to accept the case because of an unexplained delay in the request.

""We received a referral to take a three-day old officer-involved shooting case. Not knowing all the reasons as to why so much time has passed before the case was referred to BCI, we cannot accept this case,"" a spokesperson for the Attorney General's office said.

Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said that the BCI has a memorandum of understanding with Columbus Police that says the state agency should be the first call after a police shooting.

""BCI is the first call because we cannot be the subject matter experts unless we're on scene from the beginning to document the evidence of what happened from the start,"" Yost said in a statement Monday. ""Three days later after the crime scene has been dismantled and the witness(es) have all dispersed does not work.""

Columbus Police said Chief Quinlan's interest in having BCI involved in the case was ""based solely on reassuring the public of maximum independence in the investigation of this tragedy."" The department added that the Attorney General's decision to not take the case has not interrupted the investigation.

An autopsy will be performed by the Franklin County Coroner, police said.

Rallies set for later this week

The shooting has left the Black community in Columbus reeling, and rallies calling for justice in Goodson's case are set for Friday and Saturday in Columbus.

Local civil rights activists say police brutality against Black people in this central Ohio city is nothing new.

Law enforcement in Columbus has long had a strained relationship with the Black community because of its past shootings of young Black men and aggressive policing in Black neighborhoods, said Kiara Yakita, founder of the Black Liberation Movement of Central Ohio.

Movement for Black Lives leaders said they believe Goodson was ""executed.""

""A crisis of this magnitude calls for a massive realignment of power,"" said Chelsea Fuller, a Columbus-based spokeswoman for the Movement for Black Lives. ""That realignment can and will happen through defunding the police, reducing their bloated budgets, and re-investing those resources in the creation of new systems of public safety that account for all lives, not just some.""

Yakita said Black residents feel exhausted, especially after joining the nation in protesting police brutality and racism all summer.

""We are feeling helplessness, hopelessness and hurt,"" Yakita said. ""It's like we did all of that for nothing.""

Morgan Harper, a local community activist, said police in Columbus have a history of treating Black people differently.

""It's depressing, really,"" Harper said. ""And I think people were already feeling vulnerable that we can't feel protected in our own communities. That young Black men and Black women, we face an undo level of risk just living.""

Columbus' racial tension goes beyond policing. Black residents say the town's history of redlining, segregation and gentrification of Black neighborhoods has also been a boiling point.

Columbus is the fourth most economically segregated metro area in the country, according to a study the University of Toronto. The city is 59% white and 28% Black."	right

la8xf5	libertarian	Oregon law to decriminalize all drugs goes into effect, offering addicts rehab instead of prison - our candidates lose but our ideas win.	"Oregon law to decriminalize all drugs goes into effect, offering addicts rehab instead of prison

Show Caption Hide Caption Oregon decriminalizes illicit drugs, four other states legalize weed Possessing small amounts of illicit drugs will no longer mean jail time in Oregon, and four other states legalized recreational marijuana on Election Day. USA TODAY

PORTLAND, Ore. – For Janie Gullickson, rock bottom came both slowly and all at once.

A longtime drug and alcohol addict, Gullickson pushes back on the idea that one terrible day on the street leads to an epiphany and a climb back to normalcy. That’s what happens in movies, not real life.

“I lived in the bottom for years,” says Gullickson, 52. “For me and people like me, I laid there and wallowed in it for a long time.”

But if she has to pick the lowest point – one that lasted years, not days, she says – it came shortly after she hit 30 in 1998. At that time, Gullickson had five kids, ages 5 to 11, by four different men. She came home from work one day as a locksmith to find that her ex-husband had taken her two youngest and left the state. Horrified, devastated and convinced that this was the beginning of the end, her life spiraled: She dropped her other son off with his dad, left her two daughters with her mom and soon became an IV meth user.

In prison six years later, Gullickson was contemplating joining an intensive recovery program when a “striking, magnetic gorgeous Black woman walked in the room, held up a mug shot and started talking about being in the very chairs where we were sitting,” Gullickson remembers. There was life on the other side of addiction and prison, the woman said. But you have to fight for it. Gullickson believed her.

“I remember thinking, I may not be able to do all that, be what she was, but maybe I could do something different than this,” Gullickson says. “That day, I felt the door open to change and healing.”

Now Gullickson, executive director of the Mental Health & Addiction Association of Oregon, is determined to give other addicts the same opportunity. That’s why she pushed for the passage of Measure 110, first-of-its-kind legislation that decriminalizes the possession of all illegal drugs in Oregon, including heroin, cocaine, meth and oxycodone. Instead of a criminal-justice-based approach, the state will pivot to a health-care-based approach, offering addicts treatment instead of prison time. Those in possession will be fined $100, a citation that will be dropped if they agree to a health assessment.

The law goes into effect Monday and will be implemented over the next decade by the state officials at the Oregon Health Authority.

Advocates say the pivot will be life-changing for thousands of Oregonians.

“One of the things people misunderstand is how criminalization creates barriers to treatment,” says Kassandra Frederique, the executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, a national nonprofit dedicated to legalizing illicit drug use. “If we want people to make different choices, we have to give them more options ... ending criminalization will do leaps and bounds around ending shame, which automatically opens people up for other opportunities.”

Nationally, others are hopeful this could be the first in a wave of progressive measures that undo years of damage caused by drug criminalization, which disproportionately imprisoned people of color across the U.S.

“I hope that we all become more enlightened across this country that substance abuse is not something that necessitates incarceration, but speaks to other social ills – lack of health care, lack of treatment, things of that nature,” says Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., an outspoken critic of the War on Drugs. “If you’re white and wealthy, you get an opportunity to get a break, go home to your family and go into some kind of health care environment.”

But it's often different for people of color, Watson Coleman says. According to the Drug Policy Alliance, prosecutors are “twice as likely to pursue a mandatory minimum sentence for Black people as for white people charged with the same offense.” And many people of color do time for possession alone: In 2016, there were more than 1.5 million drug arrests. More than 80% were for possession only.

Watson Coleman also points out that it’s far more expensive to pay to incarcerate someone than get them treatment. Rehab programs not only empower people, she says, but they also save communities money.

'I will love you unconditionally always': Naomi Campbell pens moving tribute to godson Harry Brant after accidental overdose

In early 2020, the Oregon Health Authority announced a 10-year plan to limit health inequities across the state. Measure 110 will be a crucial step in that fight, says Steve Allen, the behavioral health director at the authority OHA.

Helping addicts fight addiction means more than just straight drug rehab, he says – addiction is rarely an isolated event, as people struggling with it are typically juggling other crises including mental illness, physical or dental health care issues, and homelessness. Too many people spend too much of their lives cycling in and out of jails and emergency departments, Allen says, instead of getting the wraparound services they need. A move to take care of the whole individual will pay huge dividends.

“What we know is that punishment for addiction doesn’t work, and doesn’t improve outcomes for people,” Allen says. He points out that the law is going into effect at a critical time: Since the COVID-19 pandemic started in spring 2020, overdoses in Oregon have skyrocketed by 70%.

The program will be paid for by redistributing existing marijuana dollars that come from the state’s cannabis tax, which Allen calls “a huge advantage” because it likely won’t be dependent on whims of the local economy (marijuana funds have gone up recently, he noted).

Advocates hope other states will follow

Gullickson, who has been sober since 2008 after a few detours, already sees a shift nationally in the conversation around addiction.

She points to the October 2020 presidential debate, when then-Democratic nominee Joe Biden said, “No one should be going to jail because they have a drug problem” and expressed support for drug diversion programs. Having Biden in the White House now “makes a huge difference” Gullickson says.

Frederique at the Drug Policy Alliance agrees and says the Biden administration’s promise to bring science back to the White House will play an important role going forward.

“We need to ground our policies in science instead of stigma and punishment,"" Frederique says.

Undoing Trump's policies: What Biden did in his first week as president

In 2018, as the House studied and voted on bills aimed at helping solve America’s opioid crisis, Watson Coleman introduced her own legislation that called for Congress to formally apologize for the war on drugs and acknowledge the damage it had done to communities of color. It also called for future drug policy to be ground in “evidence-based health care solutions.”

The war on drugs, Watson Coleman says, “was used as a weapon, as a tool to disrupt our communities. Particularly during the (Richard) Nixon era, it was a disguise to break up and weaken our communities … it wasn’t a war on drugs, it was a war on poor brown and Black men and women, and it did terrible things to families for generations.”

But she's optimistic change is coming. So is Gullickson, who's committed to helping in any and every way she can.

Now married and a grandmother of 17 – she’s slowly rebuilt relationships with almost all her children – Gullickson shares her story and all its warts because she wants others to know no matter how ugly or decimated their lives are now, something different is waiting for them.

She believes legislation like Measure 110 will create an environment where “instead of being somewhere accidentally and hoping someone will walk in and give you hope, we’re doing that proactively.” She knows it’ll take time to fully implement and there will be issues along the way. She also knows if it works, it could be implemented in other places and millions of other people like her, who once felt hopeless, alone and isolated could find something else, something good to live for.

“If we do this right in Oregon, I think there’s a will to do it everywhere,” she says. “We’ve got a huge responsibility to show that this is the right thing, and it can work.”"	right

igy8gk	libertarian	Pennsylvania Governor calls for recreational cannabis legalization to boost the economy during COVID-19 pandemic	"Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf has called on lawmakers to legalize recreational cannabis in a bid to boost economic recovery during the Coronavirus pandemic.

Assisting small businesses

Speaking during a press conference on COVID-19 recovery, the governor said the proceeds from the cannabis industry would go towards small business grant funding. Individuals who hit hard by the pandemic would also benefit from the proceeds.

Reforming government and protecting elections:



🎁 Gift ban for all public officials

🤝 Curbing special interest influence within state government

🗳 Ensuring safe and secure elections — Governor Tom Wolf (@GovernorTomWolf) August 25, 2020

Part of the press release from the Governor’s office reads:

Fifty percent of the funding would be earmarked for historically disadvantaged businesses. Along with the call to the General Assembly to pass legislation legalizing the sale and use of recreational marijuana, the governor proposes that a portion of the revenue be used to further restorative justice programs that give priority to repairing the harm done to crime victims and communities as a result of marijuana criminalization.

Criminal justice reform

Additionally, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf called on the General Assembly to track criminal justice reform policies that bring back justice for individuals convicted of marijuana-related offences. He is also suggesting additional hazard pay for workers on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic.

$225 million to increase hazard pay to Pennsylvania workers, using the overall structure of the current PA Hazard Pay Grant Program administered through the Department of Community and Economic Development. This funding would cover a $3.00/hour increase for 208,000 frontline workers across the commonwealth, the press release said.

The Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf is also drumming financial support for small businesses, childcare needs, protective equipment, and utility shut-offs. This announcement comes at a time when Vermont lawmakers, both in the House and Senate, are poised to clear a major expansion of marijuana expungement laws. The leaders in both wings agree to support a measure that would automatically expunge the criminal records of persons convicted of possessing two ounces or less of the substance.

It also aims to decriminalize possession of up to two ounces of the drug. Currently, people are allowed to possess only up to one ounce. According to Bennington Senator Dick Sears (D), passing the expungement policy in the coming weeks, as the Legislature reconvenes for a special budget session, is a priority.

Moretown Representative Maxine Grad (D), who is also the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, said she’s set to move forward with the proposal, considering that people of colour have been disproportionately impacted by marijuana charges.

Criminal records are a barrier to employment, serving in the military, student loans, housing, and it’s very important to help folks with these criminal records get justice and clean their records, Grad noted.

Many other lawmakers have supported the move including House Speaker Mitzi Johnson (D)."	right
hwlvkz	libertarian	Police in the US shoot dogs so often that a Justice Department expert calls it an “epidemic”	"Police and dogs in the US have a complicated relationship. On the one hand, canines work for cops, sniffing for drugs and bombs. On the other hand, cops shoot dogs a lot—so much so that even law enforcement publications are asking, “Can police stop killing dogs?“

This week, on Dec. 19, canine lovers were reminded of this violent phenomenon after a ruling came down from the federal Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in Michigan affirming that when police shot two pit bulls while executing a search warrant, they did not not violate the dogs owners’ constitutional rights to be free from unreasonable seizures.

Legally, a dog is property, and people in the US are constitutionally guaranteed the right to be free from unreasonable governmental seizures of property—killing counts as seizure—by the Fourth Amendment. Brown v. Battle Creek Police Department affirms these basic principles but found the dog killings justifiable (i.e., not unreasonable) in this case.

After the case was reported by the media, it sparked outrage online.

Public anger notwithstanding, the court’s opinion does not change the state of the law on police confrontations with canines. The opinion is based on the specifics of this case: The dog owners who were the plaintiffs did have a constitutional right to be free from unreasonable seizures. But, the judge found, the killings were considered justifiable under the circumstances as officers testified to feeling imminently threatened by the animals, after one of the dogs lunged and the other barked during a drug sweep. That doesn’t mean cops are allowed to shoot any dog that makes a sound or moves—only if the officers feel threatened. Nothing’s changed.

What is new in recent years, Los Angeles attorney Mildred O’Linn told the law enforcement publication Police, is the growing awareness of canine killings and how explosive community response to a dog shooting can be. Certainly social media’s popularity has something to do with this, as, perhaps, does the fact that Americans are increasingly adopting dogs in lieu of childrearing. Whatever the reason, “the public cares about these kinds of incidents on a magnitude that is sometimes lost on law enforcement,”O’Linn says.

O’Linn, a former law enforcement officer, defends police in civil suits and is all too aware of the trouble canine killings cause. She points to Hawthorne, a city in southeast Los Angeles County, where officers shot and killed a pet Rottweiler on a public street in front of the owner in 2013. In response to the dog’s death, the city network server was shut down by the hacker group Anonymous.

The exact number of dogs killed by law enforcement officers is difficult to quantify because there is no official record of these deaths across American agencies. Laurel Matthews, a program specialist with the US Department of Justice’s community-oriented policing services office, says fatal encounters are an “epidemic” and estimates that 25 to 30 pet dogs are killed daily by police.

On the flip side, the public outcry over dog deaths is infuriating to some. In light of recent police shootings of humans—brutality often captured on video and likened to modern-day lynchings—the outrage over canine killings ignited by the Sixth Circuit’s ruling triggered more social media anger—this time about the preoccupation of white Americans with their pets rather than the death of black Americans at the hands of police."	right

kl6g4a	libertarian	I’d like to congradulate drugs for winning the war on drugs!	"The 2020 elections delivered a resounding victory for drug policy reformers, who won everywhere their proposals were put to a vote. Across the country, in red and blue states, on both coasts and in between, in the Midwest and the Deep South, voters passed ballot initiatives that not only continued to reverse marijuana prohibition but also broke new ground in making drug laws less punitive and more tolerant.

New Jersey's approval of marijuana legalization was expected. Preelection surveys consistently put public support above 60 percent, although the actual margin of victory was a few points bigger than the polls suggested.

The outlook in Arizona, where voters rejected legalization in 2016, had been iffier. Public support averaged 56 percent in five polls conducted from mid-May to mid-October, and voters have been known to have second thoughts about legalization as Election Day approaches. In the end, legalization won by nearly 20 points. Survey averages likewise underestimated public support in Montana, where voters approved legalization by a 14-point margin, and Mississippi, where voters favored a relatively liberal medical marijuana initiative by a margin of nearly 3–1.

And who would have predicted that South Dakotans, who are overwhelmingly Republican and conservative, would make their state the first jurisdiction in the country to simultaneously legalize medical and recreational marijuana? Voters favored the former measure by more than 2–1, while the latter won by eight points.

The South Dakota results were not the only first. By a margin of more than 3–1, voters in Washington, D.C., approved quasi-decriminalization of ""entheogenic plants and fungi,"" including psilocybin mushrooms, peyote, iboga root, and plants that contain dimethyltryptamine. That initiative, which says suppressing the use of such substances should be ""among the lowest law enforcement priorities,"" goes further than similar measures enacted recently in Denver, Ann Arbor, Oakland, and Santa Cruz, since it applies to noncommercial production and distribution as well as possession and covers a wider range of psychedelics.

Oregon, meanwhile, became the first state to legalize psilocybin (the main psychoactive ingredient in ""magic mushrooms"") and the first to decriminalize possession of all drugs. The psilocybin initiative, which won by a margin of more than 11 points, allows adults 21 or older, regardless of whether they have a medical or psychiatric diagnosis, to consume the drug at state-licensed centers. The decriminalization measure, which was supported by nearly three-fifths of voters, makes low-level, noncommercial possession of controlled substances, which was previously a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail, a citable offense punishable by a $100 fine.

The 2020 returns confirmed that marijuana prohibition—which two-thirds of Americans oppose, according to Gallup—is on its way out. Fifteen states have now approved legalization, up from 11 before Election Day. States where recreational use has been legalized now include about a third of the U.S. population.

The results also pointed the way toward less oppressive treatment of other psychoactive substances. In 2019, when Denver became the first jurisdiction in the country to make psilocybin use a low law enforcement priority, it might have seemed like a symbolic victory with minimal practical consequences. But a similar Denver initiative dealing with marijuana, passed in 2007, helped pave the way for the 2012 legalization of cannabis in Colorado, the first state to allow recreational use. Less than two years after Denver's psilocybin vote, Oregon already has taken the next step.

Oregon's decriminalization initiative, which covers notorious substances such as heroin, fentanyl, cocaine, and methamphetamine as well as psychedelics such as LSD, shows voters can be persuaded that it is wrong to treat drug users as criminals. They will instead be treated less severely than drivers who speed or park illegally. The initiative's backers estimated that it will reduce possession arrests by more than 90 percent. While drug users can avoid the $100 fine by undergoing a ""health assessment"" at an ""addiction recovery center,"" they are not required to do so. The assessments are supposed to ""prioritize the self-identified needs of the client.""

Americans may not be ready to eliminate all penalties for drug use, let alone recognize the moral dubiousness of continuing to arrest and imprison people who merely aid and abet behavior that never should have been treated as a crime. But the history of marijuana reform shows that incremental changes can eventually lead to a fundamental reconsideration of the way the government treats psychoactive substances that politicians do not like."	right
mw2zgm	libertarian	The Government awarded a 1.3 BILLION dollar contract to a Connecticut company to make essential syringes for the COVIS-19 vaccine. They have yet to hire a single employee, or produce a single syringe. And somehow, everyone can still get vaccinated without these special syringes.	"WASHINGTON — A year after a Connecticut company was awarded federal loans and contracts worth up to nearly $1.3 billion to supply an essential syringe for the Covid-19 vaccine rollout, no syringes have been made. The syringe hasn't received even the first of a series of approvals it needs from the federal government before it can be manufactured, and a factory promising 650 jobs remains unbuilt.

ApiJect Systems Corp. positioned itself as the company that would make the difference between a stumbling rollout and delivery of lifesaving vaccines. But as the U.S. vaccine rollout hits full stride, with about half of adults in the U.S. having already received at least one injection, the need for ApiJect's device has waned, leaving the contracts and loans in question.

The company said in a statement to NBC News that it ""is working with several vaccine pharmaceutical companies to conduct the testing and regulatory reviews of Covid-19 vaccines in the ApiJect syringe.""

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

However, a spokesperson for Pfizer, one of the vaccine makers, said that even if ApiJect's syringe got all the necessary approvals from the Food and Drug Administration, it would ""not have any impact on our output or process."" Moderna didn't respond to a request for comment, and Johnson & Johnson declined to comment.

According to ApiJect, it has “packaged … for testing purposes, two of the vaccines” so the vaccine companies can do the tests required before requesting FDA approval to use the syringe with their products. Neither federal regulators nor any of the vaccine makers would confirm any pending approval requests. ApiJect didn't provide the names.

ApiJect's plant is supposed to be built in an industrial park in North Carolina, but Morgan Weston, a spokesperson for the foundation that runs the park, said that the plant hasn't been built and that ""they have not moved their operation in on any level."" She referred all other questions to the company.

Story continues

ApiJect spokesperson Steve Hofman said the land in North Carolina has been cleared and graded for construction. He wouldn't elaborate further about when construction would begin.

When President Donald Trump triggered the Defense Production Act to fight the pandemic in May, he established new authority to finance U.S. companies that wanted to make much-needed medical supplies — an effort that quickly stumbled. A $765 million loan to Eastman Kodak stalled in August after it was announced prematurely. An inspector general's report found no misconduct, but Congress continues to investigate the loan, according to a recent statement issued by the House Select Committee on the Coronavirus Crisis. The project was never restarted.

The Trump administration also approved a Defense Production Act loan for ApiJect of up to $590 million. In all, the administration awarded the company loans and contracts worth up to nearly $1.3 billion last year. In addition to the Defense Production Act loan, there was a Department of Health and Human Services contract at the end of January worth up to $453 million, just as the pandemic was emerging, and then a Defense Department contract in May worth up to $251 million.

When the Pentagon announced the ApiJect contract, it said the contract would ""enable the manufacture of more than 100 million prefilled syringes for distribution across the United States by year-end 2020.""

Image: ApiJect syringe (NBC)

The Defense Department also touted its pandemic relief work with a timeline that gave the same time frame and volume for ApiJect's syringe production.

The company maintains that it was committed only to ramping up the capacity to make that many syringes, but in a news release in May, it said it would use the government money ""to Supply 100 Million Prefilled Syringes for COVID-19 Response by Year-End 2020."" The release also said it would ""create a surge capacity to supply ... more than 500 million in 2021.""

While ApiJect didn't deliver 100 million syringes by the end of the year, it has met its obligations under its federal contracts and loan commitments, in part by lining up a subcontractor that promises to be able to produce the syringes if they are approved by the FDA.

Both the Pentagon and HHS have said ApiJect is compliant with the terms of its contracts, and the agencies have set aside $147.6 million in federal funds, which could rise with FDA approval.

No syringe shortage

The loans and the contracts were approved when alarms were being raised inside and outside the federal government about whether the U.S. would face a syringe shortage when vaccines became available. As NBC News has reported, HHS whistleblower Rick Bright warned colleagues in an email March 12, 2020, that ""It could take two plus years to make enough [syringes] to satisfy the U.S. vaccine needs for a pandemic.""

But the vaccine rollout wasn't stymied by a lack of syringes.

Meanwhile, the nearly $1.3 billion in federal loans and contracts approved for ApiJect haven't led to any ApiJect syringes' entering the country's medical supply, because the company doesn't yet have any of the FDA approvals for its needles to work with coronavirus vaccines.

The company's syringe is more complicated than a typical needle. Unlike syringes that are filled by doctors or nurses just before patients are injected, ApiJect's device would be prefilled with a vaccine before being shipped to hospitals, pharmacies and vaccination centers.

The technology hasn't been approved in the U.S. for any use. The FDA must approve not only the device's needle design, but also the needle's use with specific Covid-19 vaccines. The FDA would have to determine that storing vaccine in ApiJect's syringe didn't cause problems, such as corroding the syringe's plastic. The approvals must be requested by the vaccine makers, not by ApiJect. According to ApiJect, it has “packaged … for testing purposes, two of the vaccines” so the vaccine companies can do the tests required before the syringe can be submitted for approval for use with their vaccines.

A senior HHS official in the Trump administration said it was surprising that the FDA hadn't approved the device yet, because approval of the vaccines had been expected to be quick.

An FDA spokesperson declined to comment on ApiJect's proposal, referring to a policy of not issuing public statements about medical device applications.

Exact records of how much ApiJect has gotten aren't yet public. Hofman, the ApiJect spokesperson, said ApiJect has invoiced HHS for $1.3 million and declined to say how much it has billed the Pentagon, which has set aside $138 million under the contract. Neither HHS nor the Pentagon would say how much they had been billed.

Meanwhile, ApiJect needs to raise about $197 million to help secure the additional $590 million federal loan. Jefferies Financial Group Inc. is working to raise the money through private sources. Hofman said the loan is close to being finalized but declined to predict when it would be completed, citing ongoing due diligence by the federal government.

Although ApiJect got its federal loan and contracts as part of efforts to increase domestic production of medical supplies, if the FDA approves its syringes, they would first be produced by the Chinese-owned company Ritedose's facility in South Carolina.

Ritedose, which is owned by the Hong Kong-based private equity fund AGIC Capital and the Chinese pharmaceutical company Humanwell Healthcare (Group) Co., referred questions to ApiJect.

The federal loan to ApiJect would be provided through the U.S. Development Finance Corp., an agency the federal government established to help developing countries pay for needed projects, like low-income housing in Costa Rica and small-business microloans in Cambodia. The agency declined to comment about the loan specifically, but it said the Defense Production Act loan program ""has a pipeline of applications for critical projects.""

""These applicants are in various stages of our stringent diligence process,"" it said.

Hofman said it's important for a company like ApiJect to be supported in the U.S. to expand the country's domestic production of syringes so it can rely less on overseas manufacturers. Last year, ""there was a concern that we would run short in these things,"" he said, adding, ""Everybody was highly critical, rightly so, of the lack of planning on other elements of the response to the pandemic.""

And ApiJect syringes could still play a key role in getting vaccines to Americans, especially if booster shots are needed.

""We do not know, sitting here today, what demand for injectables in this pandemic will be, not only in the United States, but in the rest of the world,"" Hofman said. ""So the idea that the United States supported an option to create significant new domestically based capacity with a very, very strong supply chain — we have always thought as a public policy matter that was absolutely the right thing to do.

""The fact that we are the ones doing it — we recognize our obligation to perform and to do what we're supposed to do,"" he said.

This report is part of an ongoing collaboration with the Global Reporting Centre on global supply chains.

CORRECTION (April 21, 2021, 10:35 p.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misstated what ApiJect told NBC News about the FDA approval process for its syringe product. ApiJect says it supplied two vaccine makers with its devices for testing, which is necessary before the companies could make a submission to the FDA for the device’s approval. ApiJect did not tell NBC News that two vaccine makers had submitted their vaccines for approval to the FDA for use with ApiJect’s syringes."	right

Even with the 50 states certifying ballot access Jo Jorgensen is unlikely to be invited into the presidential debates. This disenfranchisement stems from extreme levels of collaboration to exclude third parties from the debates committed by the commission on presidential debates.

Google on Thursday deleted 100,000 bad reviews written after the app restricted GameStop purchases.

But Google is not stepping in for a new wave of negative reviews, it said.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The stock-trading app Robinhood on Tuesday dropped down to a one-star rating on the Google Play app store for the second time in less than a week — and this time, Google isn't riding to the rescue.

Google on Thursday removed negative reviews of the Robinhood app, saying that ""ratings and reviews meant to manipulate an app's average rating or top reviews"" violate its policies.

The tech giant has said the new reviews are compliant with its policies and won't be removed, The Verge reported.

As of Tuesday morning, Robinhood had a 1.1-star rating from more than 310,000 reviews on the Google Play store. On Thursday, the app also had just one star before Google bumped its rating back up to four stars by deleting 100,000 reviews from unhappy users.

Their discontent stemmed from Robinhood's decision to limit purchases of GameStop stock, as well as other stocks promoted by the Wall Street Bets Reddit community.

Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told CNBC on Thursday that the trading app acted to protect itself and its customers. In an interview with Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Sunday, Tenev said Robinhood had been forced to temporarily stop users from buying those stocks because the surge had resulted in a deposit requirement of $3 billion from the National Securities Clearing Corp.

This echoed an email Robinhood sent to members Monday that said: ""We didn't want to stop people from buying stocks and we certainly weren't trying to help hedge funds.""

Google said it had a way of identifying spam and abuse of the app-review systems, adding that it wanted trustworthy reviews in its Play store.

It added it had public guidelines outlining policies on app reviews and ratings and requesting users not post fake reviews intended to increase or lower ratings.

On Apple's App Store, Robinhood had a solid four-star rating on Tuesday morning, but the number of negative reviews is growing. On Thursday, the app had 2.4 million reviews. Since then, the number has jumped to 3 million."	right
i9ke1b	libertarian	Bald eagle attacks state’s $950 drone in U.P., sends it to bottom of Lake Michigan	"ESCANABA, MI - In what state officials are describing tongue-in-cheek as a “brazen attack,” a bald eagle recently snatched a $950 drone belonging to the state of Michigan that was being flown to document shoreline erosion damage in the Upper Peninsula. After a brief tussle, the big bird ripped off one of the propellers from the small spinning aircraft and sent it to the bottom of Lake Michigan near Escanaba, state workers said.

The drone was being operated by a pilot for the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) when the July 21 attack occurred. Is the department’s acronym a coincidence when considering the predator? The state thinks not.

“The attack could have been a territorial squabble with the electronic foe, or just a hungry eagle. Or maybe it did not like its name being misspelled,” the department said in a news release today. “EGLE’s drone team is considering steps to reduce the possibility of a repeat attack, including possibly using ‘skins’ or other designs on the aircraft to make them look less like seagulls.”

Here’s what we know about the airborne attack:

EGLE quality analyst and drone pilot Hunter King was on his fourth mapping run of the day with the drone, capturing images of shoreline erosion so the state agency can document how recent high-water levels have affected the Great Lakes and give them data on which communities need help coping with damage.

The pilot said the drone was about seven minutes into its mapping flight when he noticed that its satellite reception was getting weak. “He pressed the ‘Go Home’ recall button. The drone dutifully turned, reacquiring a strong satellite feed,” the agency said.

“King was watching his video screen as the drone beelined for home, but suddenly it began twirling furiously,” like a bad rollercoaster ride, he told the department.

“When he looked up, the drone was gone, and an eagle was flying away. A nearby couple ... later confirmed they saw the eagle strike something but were surprised to learn it was a drone. Both King and the couple said the eagle appeared uninjured as it flew from the scene of the crime.”

King and the couple all searched for the drone, but found nothing.

Flight data showed the drone had hit the lake about 150 feet from shore, and landed in 4 feet of water. Employees used that information days later when they returned to search for the little aircraft.

“EGLE Unmanned Aircraft Systems coordinator Arthur Ostaszewski brought a kayak and snorkeling gear to the search. With near-zero visibility in water darkened by tannin, Ostaszewski scrapped the snorkel and instead walked a grid pattern shuffling his feet for two hours in soft muck (“like I was playing Battleship and wanted to cover the entire board”). He too was luckless, abandoned the search when lightning began to accompany a cold drizzle.”

The drone was a Phantom 4 Pro Advanced, which will be replaced, the department said.

Here were the ill-fated flight’s final moments, according to the drone data released by EGLE:

The eagle strike occurred 7:39.7 into the flight, roughly four-tenths of a mile from King and 162 feet above the water.

Its speed instantly dropped from 22 mph to 10. Within a half-second, the flight record shows the beginning of downward spiral along with “excessive spinning” warnings.

In the next 3.5 seconds the drone sent 27 warning notifications including one indicating a propeller had been torn off.

Gaining momentum as it fell, its last communication came at 34 feet above the water, falling at 30 feet per second, or 20.4 mph.

Eagles have enjoyed a nice uptick in Michigan in recent years, the state said. In 2019, a federal survey found 849 active nesting sites in the Upper and Lower Peninsulas. This is a big jump compared to the low numbers of the 1970s, which saw just 76 nesting sites in some years.

A little more levity from the EGLE staff: They said they contacted the DNR hoping to get a citation issued to the rogue eagle.

“Unfortunately, there’s nothing we can do,” the spokesman said. “Nature is a cruel and unforgiving mistress.”

Mosby made the announcement on Friday following her office's one-year experiment in not prosecuting minor offenses to decrease the spread of Covid-19 behind bars.

""Today, America's war on drug users is over in the city of Baltimore. We leave behind the era of tough-on-crime prosecution and zero tolerance policing and no longer default to the status quo to criminalize mostly people of color for addiction, said Mosby in an official press release

The experiment, known as The Covid Criminal Justice Policies, is an approach to crime developed with public health authorities. Instead of prosecuting people arrested for minor crimes like prostitution and public urination, the program dealt with those crimes as public health issues and work with community partners to help find solutions.

The program has led to decreases in the overall incarcerated Baltimore population by 18%, while violent and property crimes are down 20% and 36% respectively, according to the press release."	right
gkumjj	libertarian	North Carolina Supreme Court Overturns Awful Decision By Appeals Court, Says Giving The Finger To Cops Isn't A Crime	"North Carolina Supreme Court Overturns Awful Decision By Appeals Court, Says Giving The Finger To Cops Isn't A Crime

from the possibly-unwise-but-not-illegal dept

Last August, the North Carolina Court of Appeals decided it was OK for police officers to use protected speech as the basis for retaliatory stops. The stop -- and the criminal charges that followed -- originated from this interaction:

While assisting the stranded motorist, Trooper Stevens turned his attention to another car traveling on the roadway. Defendant, a passenger in a small white SUV, had his arm outside of the window and was making a back-and-forth waving motion with his hand. As Trooper Stevens turned to look towards the car, defendant’s gesture changed from a waving motion to a pumping up-and-down motion with his middle finger. Believing that defendant was committing the crime of disorderly conduct, Trooper Stevens got into his patrol car to pursue and stop the SUV.

The ensuing stop resulted in the defendant being charged with obstruction -- not because of his middle finger waving, but because he, at first, refused to present his ID to the trooper. He was never charged with the disorderly conduct the trooper felt was criminal enough to justify a stop.

Despite several other courts reaching the opposite conclusion -- that flipping the bird cannot form the basis for a lawful stop -- the NC Court of Appeals went in a different direction.

Here, without having to determine whether Defendant’s conduct of extending his middle finger, in itself, constituted a crime, we conclude that the trooper had reasonable suspicion to initiate the stop of Defendant. The trooper saw Defendant make rude, distracting gestures while traveling on a highway in a moving vehicle in the vicinity of other moving vehicles. A reasonable, objective officer having viewed Defendant’s behavior could believe that a crime had been or was in the process of being committed. For instance, the crime of disorderly conduct in North Carolina is committed where a person “makes or uses any . . . gesture . . . intended and plainly likely to provoke violent retaliation and thereby cause a breach of the peace.” N.C. Gen. Stat. § 14-288.4(a)(2) (2017). Defendant’s actions, both his waving and middle finger taken together, aimed at an unknown target could alert an objective officer to an impending breach of the peace.

And just like that, North Carolina law enforcement officers had permission to engage in retaliatory stops. This ruling was greeted with near-unanimous derision, given its hot take on the statute Trooper Stevens pulled out of his ass to justify his actions. At least one law prof speculated social media outrage had something to do with the court's decision to withdraw its opinion roughly two weeks after it had delivered it.

Whatever second thoughts the majority might have had about their conclusion, they weren't enough to overcome their first thoughts. A couple of days later, the court released an amended opinion that changed nothing but how loudly the table was being pounded. It doubled down on its bad legal rationale, claiming that the fact that the rude hand gesture continued after the car had passed the state trooper as the vehicle continued down the road changed it from protected speech (a middle finger extended to law enforcement) to a crime (a middle finger extended to no one in particular).

Unlike the circumstances in those other cases, where all that was involved was an individual expressing contempt to a law enforcement officer, here, it was not clear to the trooper to whom Defendant was continuously gesturing. Indeed, Defendant was well past the trooper when he changed his gesture to a pumping motion with his middle finger extended. While it may be reasonable for the trooper to suspect that the gesturing was, in fact, meant for him, and therefore may be constitutionally protected speech, it was also objectively reasonable for the trooper to suspect that the gesturing was directed toward someone in another vehicle and that the situation was escalating. Such continuous and escalating gesturing directed at a driver in another vehicle, if unchecked, could constitute the crime of “disorderly conduct.”

The stupidity is finally over. The state's Supreme Court has reversed [PDF] the Appeals Court ruling, determining that an objectionable hand gesture alone cannot provide the basis for a traffic stop. (h/t Volokh Conspiracy)

We conclude that these facts alone are insufficient to provide reasonable suspicion that defendant was engaged in disorderly conduct. The fact that Trooper Stevens was unsure of whether defendant’s gesture may have been directed at another vehicle does not, on its own, provide reasonable suspicion that defendant intended to or was plainly likely to provoke violent retaliation from another driver. Likewise, the mere fact that defendant’s gesture changed from waving to “flipping the bird” is insufficient to conclude defendant’s conduct was likely to cause a breach of the peace. Based on the facts in the record, we are unable to infer that, by gesturing with his middle finger, defendant was intending to or was likely to provoke a violent reaction from another driver that would cause a breach of the peace. Thus, we conclude that it was error for the trial court to find that there was reasonable suspicion of disorderly conduct to justify the stop.

It also appears the government lost interest in defending the actions of Trooper Stevens. Its only argument was that the stop was justified under the community caretaking function, which the Appeals Court rejected in favor of the trooper's disorderly conduct theory. The Supreme Court notes it presented no arguments here at all, making it that much easier for it to overturn the lower court's decision.

In its brief here, the State acknowledges that its sole argument in the Court of Appeals involved the community caretaking exception, and that the court unanimously rejected that argument. In fact, the State agrees that the specific, articulable facts in the record do not establish reasonable suspicion of the crime of disorderly conduct.

That sends the decision back to the Appeals Court, which will have to send it back to the trial court to finally grant the suppression motion that triggered this unfortunate succession of bad decisions by North Carolina courts. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court doesn't go so far as to say giving cops the finger is always protected speech, but it does make it clear it's not a criminal act and, alone, cannot justify a stop.

jnvdoq	libertarian	Marshall Burt becomes first Libertarian elected to a state legislature since 1994.	"The Libertarian Party (L.P.) had high hopes for a win in the Wyoming state House in two different races—and one of them came through. Marshall Burt has won in District 39 against Democrat Stan Blake, 1,696 to 1,420, according to Apollo Pazell, who was running the L.P.'s campaigns in the state.

This is only the fifth time the L.P. has won a state legislative seat with a candidate running only under the Libertarian label.

In Wyoming's House District 55, Bethany Baldes, who in 2018 lost a state House race against an incumbent GOP majority leader by only 53 votes, lost to Republican Ember Oakley by only 32 votes, 2,058 to 2,026.

In other L.P. races of note around America, Donald Rainwater, in a three-way race for governor of Indiana, has earned 13.1 percent of the vote with well over 90 percent of the results in. That is right in line with polling from last month, even though third-party results tend to fall precipitously from earlier polls when actual votes are cast. Rainwater came in ahead of Democrat Woody Myers in nearly two dozen counties around the state. Republican incumbent Eric Holcomb won reelection.

In Arkansas, with 81 percent of the vote counted, the L.P.'s Ricky Harrington got 33.3 percent in his race to dethrone Republican Sen. Tom Cotton. (No Democrat was on the ballot.) Harrington won outright in two counties. In Pulaski County, which contains the state capitol of Little Rock, Harrington leads Cotton 59 percent to 41 percent.

In Kentucky's Senate race, which Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell won with 58 percent of the vote, Libertarian Brad Barron got 4 percent while losing Democrat Amy McGrath earned 38 percent.

In Montana, L.P. gubernatorial candidate Lyman Bishop currently has around 3.5 percent with about 52 percent of the votes counted. That's more than 10,000 votes in a race where the declared winner—Republican Greg Gianforte—is presently ahead of Democrat Mike Cooney by about that many votes."	right

my5wni	libertarian	GOP Congressman’s Bill Would Protect Marijuana Consumers’ 2nd Amendment Rights -- H.R. 2830, the Gun Rights and Marijuana Act, was filed on Thursday by Rep. Don Young (R-AK) and two GOP cosponsors.	"A new bill in Congress would protect Second Amendment rights for cannabis consumers by exempting people in legalized states from a federal restriction that bars any “unlawful user” of a controlled substance from owning a firearm.

H.R. 2830, the Gun Rights and Marijuana Act, filed on Thursday by Rep. Don Young (R-AK) and two GOP cosponsors, adds a short provision to existing federal law specifying that “the term ‘unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance’ shall not include a person by reason of unlawful use or addiction to marijuana.”

The exemption would apply only to people who lives in a state or tribal jurisdiction that permits the use of marijuana by adults, and only if they do not violate the local cannabis laws laws. Marijuana would remain a Schedule I controlled substance under the proposal, and the federal restriction against owning firearms would remain in place for consumers of any other drug.

“The federal government has no business unduly restricting responsible citizens from exercising their rights or restricting states from listening to their constituents and reforming marijuana laws,” Young, who is a co-chair of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus, said. “The GRAM Act bridges this gap. Given that it deals with both gun and marijuana rights, there really is something for those on both sides of the aisle to support.”

I took an oath to defend the ENTIRE Bill of Rights. The GRAM Act protects both #2A rights and the 10th Amendment rights of states to set their own cannabis laws, as Alaska did. Thank you to @RepBrianMast and @RodneyDavis for your support in this fight. https://t.co/J6nP6zKnO3 — Rep. Don Young (@repdonyoung) April 23, 2021

“When I was sworn into Congress, I took an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States. That oath does not mean picking and choosing which Amendments to defend; it requires us as Members of Congress to protect the ENTIRE Bill of Rights,” he said. “There are two main pillars that make this legislation important. First, it protects the Second Amendment for individuals seeking to exercise their Constitutional rights. It also defends the Tenth Amendment right of states to determine their own cannabis laws, as Alaska did in 2014.”

The bill has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee.

Rep. Brian Mast (R-FL), who is an initial cosponsor of the legislation, said “it should be up to individual states to determine their own marijuana laws, not the federal government.”

“The Constitution says nothing about marijuana but the Second Amendment clearly outlines every American’s right to bear arms,” he said.

Rep. Rodney Davis (R-IL), the other original cosponsor, said “state-legal marijuana use should not be used as a pretext to bar individuals from purchasing or possessing firearms, which is a clear and well-defined Constitutional right.”

Under current U.S. law, Americans are forbidden from possessing firearms if they are “an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance” as defined under the federal Controlled Substances Act.

While law enforcement does not actively screen gun owners for substance use, a question on a U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) form asks would-be gun purchasers: “Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?” Lying on the form is a felony.

“Gun ownership is a significant part of Alaska’s culture and lifestyle. When my constituents chose to legalize adult-use marijuana, they were not surrendering their Second Amendment rights,” Young said. “At a time when more individuals have been purchasing firearms for self-defense, sportsmanship, hunting, and countless other reasons, we have experienced a surge in state-level cannabis reforms.”

The current federal provision has raised concerns among Second Amendment rights advocates in states that have legalized, or considered legalizing, cannabis for medical or adult use. In 2017, for example, police in Honolulu sent letters to local medical marijuana patients instructing them to “voluntarily surrender” their firearms, a request the department later walked back.

Last year the U.S. Justice Department issued a memo requiring gun dealers in Michigan to conduct federal background checks on all unlicensed gun buyers, asserting that existing practices had enabled “habitual marijuana users” and other disqualified individuals to obtain fire arms illegally.

“Although possession and use of marijuana is not unlawful under Michigan law,” the advisory said, “marijuana remains a ‘controlled substance’ under Federal law, and those using marijuana are prohibited from possessing or transporting a firearm.”

Republicans have often led the charge to protect Second Amendment rights for lawful cannabis consumers. Rep. Andy Mooney (R-KY) introduced a bill last year that would have similarly harmonized state and federal law, but only for patients who use marijuana medically.

In late 2018, another Republican congressman, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), told Marijuana Moment that he was considering a bill to extend Second Amendment protections to all legal marijuana consumers, not just medical patients. No such bill ever materialized, however.

Meanwhile, Democratic leaders in Congress are working on legislation to fully legalize cannabis at the federal level, a change that would presumably automatically end the restriction on gun ownership by marijuana users without specifically addressing it.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) have been working on a bill on their side. Schumer said last week that the legislation will be introduced and placed on the floor “soon.” On Monday he told Marijuana Moment that he’s working to push the president in a pro-legalization direction as they draft the measure.

On the House side, Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) said recently that he plans to reintroduced his legalization bill, the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act, which cleared the chamber last year but did not advance in the Senate under GOP control.

President Joe Biden, meanwhile, is still not on board with legalization, as confirmed again by the White House press secretary on Tuesday. While the president says he supports allowing states to set their own policies, he feels it should only be decriminalized and rescheduled federally and wants more research to be done if he’s to change his position on broader reform.

n0ney9	libertarian	“If an individual who said they had nothing illegal in the vehicle says, ‘No, I don’t want you to search my car,’ it could be an additional indicator of illegal activity” PA State Trooper	"Spotlight PA is an independent, non-partisan newsroom powered by The Philadelphia Inquirer in partnership with PennLive/The Patriot-News, TribLIVE/Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, and WITF Public Media.

By Joseph Darius Jaafari of Spotlight PA

HARRISBURG — When Brandon Neely was pulled over in August 2020 for crossing into the area between a highway lane and exit ramp after leaving a casino in Dauphin County, a Pennsylvania State Police trooper asked if he could search Neely’s vehicle.

Neely, knowing his rights, said no. But the trooper searched anyway, as Neely streamed video to Facebook Live.

“If an individual who said they had nothing illegal in the vehicle says, ‘No, I don’t want you to search my car,’ it could be an additional indicator [of illegal activity],” the officer, who was not identified, said in the video.

After 30 minutes, the trooper found nothing and let Neely go.

Law enforcement officers across the country have long used administrative or other traffic violations considered to be a low public safety threat as a gateway for searching vehicles and compiling incriminating evidence. Conversations about this tactic were reignited by the killing of 20-year-old Daunte Wright earlier this month.

A Brooklyn Center, Minnesota police officer stopped 20-year-old Wright for expired tags, and for possibly hanging an air freshener on his rearview mirror. The officer who pulled Wright over, Kim Potter, later killed him.

Since then, Potter has resigned from the police force and is being charged with manslaughter, and the city’s police chief left his post.

“Are the roads safer because you stopped someone because of an expired tag or an air freshener?” asked David Harris, a law professor at University of Pittsburgh who specializes in police training. “Traffic stops are the most common interaction police have with Americans and also they can be dangerous.”

In reviewing dozens of affidavits of searches that were deemed illegal by judges, collected during a five-year period, Spotlight PA last year found Pennsylvania State Police often used a wide range of what is known as pretextual stops — pulling people over for driving in the center or right lanes for too long, or having an unlit license plate — to stop drivers and then question them.

From there, officers scan for anything they might perceive as evidence the person is committing or has committed a crime.

Troopers have also been trained in recent years to look for more than 50 “criminal indicators,” including high car mileage, if the car is a rental, any amounts of money in the car, audible sighs, or if the driver is being overtly cooperative, according to an unofficial form obtained by Spotlight PA.

While the state maintains troopers no longer use it, its messaging still lingers. By sweating, stuttering, or simply misstating something and then backtracking — officers can use these traits they perceive as incriminating evidence.

This is a decision that has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.

“Once police pull people over, it’s often a fishing expedition,” said Jonathan M. Smith, executive director of the Washington Lawyers’ Committee in Washington, D.C. who last year represented a Maryland family in a case where police pulled them over for a windshield obstruction and later conducted an illegal search of their vehicle.

A State Police official previously said troopers are enforcing traffic laws, and that escalation through these tactics can yield large-scale drug busts or weapons collections.

“At the end of the day, there’s sort of this philosophical argument and then there is the legal sufficiency argument,” Lt. Col. Scott Price, deputy commissioner of operations for Pennsylvania State Police, said in an interview last year. “We’re looking at totality. Nervousness alone is not a probable cause, but nervousness in concert with inconsistent statements, or a strong smell of marijuana [is]. I think that’s the key point.”

But a Spotlight PA investigation with The Appeal last year found that judges don’t always agree. Many have thrown out searches initiated by pretextual traffic stops, because there was no actual probable cause.

In response to the reporting, the state Office of the Inspector General opened an investigation into some traffic stops and searches by State Police, and that review is ongoing.

An added worry is how police use pretextual stops disparately against people of color, said Siyu Liu, a criminal justice professor at Penn State, who co-authored a research article this year on how police use traffic stops to conduct searches.

“With minorities being more likely to be pulled over for traffic violations, their exposure to criminal investigation and police scrutiny increases,” she told Spotlight PA.

Neely, who is Black, was not required to tell the trooper anything beyond what he needed to issue a ticket or warning. But even in cooperating, Neely was incriminated.

In response to Neely’s case, State Police spokesperson Ryan Tarkowski declined to comment, but he asserted that troopers should not conduct searches based on drivers denying entry into their vehicle.

“It was a complete violation of my rights,” Neely told Spotlight PA. “I knew my rights, and even when I exercised them, I still was pulled out and searched.”

Want to contribute to a larger project to collect this data from many more counties? https://www.reddit.com/r/DataPolice/wiki/how_to_contribute

In the 2002 dystopian sci-fi film “Minority Report,” law enforcement can manage crime by “predicting” illegal behavior before it happens. While fiction, the plot is intriguing and contributes to the conversation on advanced crime-fighting technology. However, today’s world may not be far off.

Data’s role in our lives and more accessibility to artificial intelligence is changing the way we approach topics such as research, real estate, and law enforcement. In fact, recent investigative reporting has shown that “dozens of [American] cities” are now experimenting with predictive policing technology.

Despite the current controversy surrounding predictive policing, it seems to be a growing trend that has been met with little real resistance. We may be closer to policing that mirrors the frightening depictions in “Minority Report” than we ever thought possible.

Fighting Fire With Fire

In its current state, predictive policing is defined as:

“The usage of mathematical, predictive analytics, and other analytical techniques in law enforcement to identify potential criminal activity. Predictive policing methods fall into four general categories: methods for predicting crimes, methods for predicting offenders, methods for predicting perpetrators’ identities, and methods for predicting victims of crime.”

While it might not be possible to prevent predictive policing from being employed by the criminal justice system, perhaps there are ways we can create a more level playing field: One where the powers of big data analysis aren’t just used to predict crime, but also are used to police law enforcement themselves.

Below, we’ve provided a detailed breakdown of what this potential reality could look like when applied to one South Florida county’s public databases, along with information on how citizens and communities can use public data to better understand the behaviors of local law enforcement and even individual police officers.

Not-So-Public Public Records

Thankfully, we have decently robust laws and regulations regarding the public’s right to data collected by federal, state, and local agencies, including policing data. While the laws do vary somewhat state to state, nearly every county in the United States provides some mechanism for requesting or digitally obtaining police activity data. Arrests, citations, trends, and sometimes officer complaint information is available.

The problem, however, is that while this data is “available,” that is very different from being “easily accessible.” More often than not, granular police officer-level data is not possible to gather digitally from county public record tools, or you must request this data directly, sometimes waiting many months to be sent the data after submitting a FOIA request.

This leads to a situation where the letter of the law is met, but the spirit of the law (the ability for the public to have real access) is not.

Citizen Coders and Data Investigators Unite!

The key to leveling the playing field lies in either forcing police data accessibility through legislation (mandating a standard way of making all records easily accessible) – which seems unlikely to happen in the near future – or strengthening a citizen-led effort to find, scrape, collate, and formalize county-level police data collaboratively.

This creates an environment where information is not just available but truly accessible through transparent means.

Deep-Dive Analysis of One Florida County’s Citation Statistics

Palm Beach County, Florida, is an excellent example of where policing data is public, but gathering enough data to do any deep analysis is typically impossible without writing code to scrape records one by one.

The county’s public portal has no options for bulk downloading or mass exporting of data, so because of this, investigating the behaviors of individual police officers or even whole departments is nearly impossible. To do so means individually downloading and collating tens of thousands of records. Without writing software to do this, it cannot be done in any reasonable time frame.

So we did just that.

With our development team, we wrote a custom scraping tool to iterate through all of the public records available via the Palm Beach County court records search tool provided on its website.

Doing so required writing complex code that could accurately grab the records and avoid the rate-limiting mechanisms. The code we used for this scrape is could very likely be adapted for use with public record search tools used by other counties.

Developing and sharing county record scraping code is one extremely effective way to create a national repository of county-level police activity and, in our opinion, is a very worthy endeavor for anyone with such a skill set.

Palm Beach County Traffic Citations and Race

Racism in policing is among the most disturbing trends in law enforcement. The widely controversial and damaging “stop and frisk” policy is an example where vague terminology led to varying interpretations of what a “reasonable stop” meant, allowing officers to exercise their prejudice across a wide variety of jurisdictions.

More somberly, shootings involving white police officers and black suspects result in highly contentious skirmishes between local populations and police departments. It’s not enough to address racial bias after the fact when it is too late to prevent fatal incidents from taking place.

Armed with county-level policing data, the public can view the actions, trends, arrest and citation records, and more in relation to how each officer spends their resources. Unfortunately, these findings indicate disparities in how officers treat others based on their race, gender, and more.

By leveraging county-level data, it is possible to find officers who are exhibiting behaviors that could indicate a strong racial bias.

Traffic Citation Race/Ethnicity Distribution in Palm Beach County, FL

The above view shows the racial/ethnic distribution of traffic citations given by the 75 officers in Palm Beach County with the most tickets given over the last year. The distribution of the race/ethnicity of those given citations is then shown for each officer. The columns with asterisks point to officers who have racial/ethnic distributions that are significantly unbalanced compared to the department as a whole.



While it makes sense that officers who patrol minority neighborhoods would have a higher distribution of one race or another, a few of these examples seem highly unlikely even given that caveat. For instance:

There are at least three officers who gave 88%+ of their citations to white people.

There are at least two officers who gave 75%+ of their citations to nonwhite people.

While there may be good explanations for these outliers, identifying them enables us to ask for clarification or further investigation. Cops who cite one race/ethnicity 90% of the time should be made to answer as to what could have resulted in such an uneven distribution.

Racial Inequity in Citation Type

With the full dataset collated, we can also break down traffic citation types by race/ethnicity, allowing us to see if certain types of citations have disproportionate race/ethnicity distributions. In this case, we find several, pointed out with asterisks above. They include:

Statute 316.1995 – Driving on Sidewalk or Bike Path: ~75% minorities given this citation

Statute 316.613 – Child Safety Restraints: ~85% minorities given this citation

Statute 322.615 – Driver’s Permit Violation: ~86% minorities given this citation

Statute 316.2954 – Window Tint Violation: ~70% minorities given this citation

These percentages seem suspiciously high. The Palm Beach County police force should be held accountable for explaining such inequities. It’s possible that there are good explanations, but these ratios might also represent police profiling or even racism.

With this data, it is even possible to look at the distributions of race/ethnicity by citation for individual police officers, enabling the identification of officers who have overall equitable distributions of race/ethnicity across all traffic citation types but inequitable distributions of some categories of citations.

Palm Beach County Traffic Citations and Gender

Gender bias and sexism in traffic citations can also be looked for when data has been aggregated. Below is a view of the distribution of gender of those given citations for the officers with the most number of citations over the last year.

Compared to the distribution of race/ethnicity, we see a much more natural-looking variability, one that can easily be explained away by chance. However, by looking at all officers, some have bizarre distributions of citations by gender, with a handful of officers giving more than 65% of their citations to women, despite men receiving 60% of all citations.

Palm Beach County Traffic Citation Trends and Citation Quotas

While monitoring race/ethnicity and gender bias of individual police officers and departments are most important, additional public data can be analyzed to give citizens the ability to curb other predatory or unfair police practices.

Using this data, it is possible to infer when police departments set internal traffic citation quotas and internal directives that focus on specific traffic statute violations.

Looking cumulatively at all citations given over the last year, we see a clear sway toward certain types of traffic violations.

Below are the top 10 statutes that police officers in Palm Beach County most frequently write citations for:

316.187 – Speeding on State Roads 316.189 –Speeding on City/Municipality Roads 316.646 – No Registration or Proof of Insurance 320.07 – Expired Registration 320.0605 – Secondary Registration Issues 316.614 – Safety Belt Violations 322.34 – Driving With Suspended/Revoked License 316.075 – Traffic Signal Violations 322.15 – Driving Without a Driver’s License With Them 316.1925 – Careless Driving

This gives us a good sense of the focus of police traffic citations and the most common violation types for the given population. Measuring changes in these numbers over time can give insights into the focus of an entire county, department, or even individual officer.

We can also look at how this department accumulates citations over time.

There is a relatively consistent number of citations given over the course of the month, which refutes the common belief that cops pull over more people at the end of the month to hit quotas. While data from other counties may prove to be different, in the case of Palm Beach County data, we don’t really see that.

Furthermore, we can see that there do seem to be at least a few days with significantly larger or smaller numbers of citations given, on average: The 11th and 25th days of the month seem conspicuously light, while the 12th, 16th, and 30th seem conspicuously high in volume.

We can also use the data to better understand individual officer citation rates over time. Below is a look at the officers with the highest volume of arrests. It’s interesting to see such wide variability month to month, with some officers even having months-long gaps. Huge gaps or steep decreases would indicate that the officer was tasked with something entirely different during that period, was off duty for some reason, or was otherwise less productive.



The Rabbit Hole Is Very Deep

The data visualizations and explorations above are the tip of the iceberg in terms of what can be done and what can be learned. Police forces around the nation ought to be held accountable for the actions of their departments in their entirety.

It is our firm belief that the integrity of our justice system depends on police and law enforcement bodies being held accountable for their actions. Publicly accessible policing information creates transparency between communities and their specific law enforcement officers, protecting both groups with free access to internal data.

We’ve put together this code to bypass the painstakingly difficult process of individually cataloging each record and to allow the public to explore our findings.

The more inquisitive members of the community we can recruit into regularly examining this level of police data, the better we will be at preemptively identifying troubling overall trends or problems at the individual officer level.

gxohkx	libertarian	Denver police ordered to stop using tear gas and plastic bullets in protests	"DENVER (Reuters) - A U.S. District Court Judge ordered Denver police on Friday not to use tear gas, plastic bullets and other “less-than-lethal” force such as flash grenades against protesters, unless approved by a senior officer in response to specific acts of violence.

FILE PHOTO: Demonstrators face off with police in riot gear near the Capitol building, to protest Monday's killing of African-American man George Floyd in Minneapolis by a white police officer, in Denver, Colorado, U.S., May 28, 2020 in this image obtained from social media.

The temporary injunction was in response to an ongoing local lawsuit filed on Thursday in Denver District Court by protesters complaining about excessive force used by officers during demonstrations following the death of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, in police custody in Minneapolis last month.

The ruling, which is in effect for 14 days, cited examples of protesters and journalists being injured by police.

“Peaceful demonstrators’ legitimate and credible fear of police retaliation is silencing their political speech,” it said.

The death of Houston native Floyd during his arrest for a non-violent offense has touched off national protests against the use of force by police.

In Denver, throngs of marchers have gathered around the state Capitol every day for more than a week, chanting and carrying signs protesting Floyd’s killing.

Some people among the mostly peaceful crowd broke windows in the state Supreme Court building and a nearby museum overnight on May 29. Some store front windows were smashed and looters made off with merchandise.

While the lawsuit, brought by four activists, acknowledges that some demonstrators “engaged in destructive behavior,” and it also says the vast majority were peaceful.

“Nonetheless, the Denver Police Department ... and other police departments at their invitation, have engaged in injurious riot control tactics without issuing clear warnings and orders to disperse,” the complaint said.

At least one woman sustained a serious eye injury when she was struck by a projectile, the lawsuit said.

‘EXTREME TACTICS’

The court ruling cited numerous instances, captured on video, of police using tear gas, projectiles and other measures against peaceful protesters engaged in their U.S. Constitutional rights to gather and protest.

Journalists were also specifically targeted and shot with projectiles, “while in the process of documenting the scene,” the ruling said.

In his decision, U.S. District Judge R. Brooke Jackson said he sought to balance citizens’ constitutional rights against police officers’ ability to do their jobs, and that Denver police had “failed in its duty to police its own.”

“If a store’s windows must be broken to prevent a protester’s facial bones from being broken or eye being permanently damaged, that is more than a fair trade,” Jackson wrote in his 10-page ruling.

“These are peaceful demonstrators, journalists, and medics who have been targeted with extreme tactics meant to suppress riots, not to suppress demonstrations.”

His ruling stops Denver police from using chemical weapons or projectiles unless a captain or more senior on-scene supervisor authorizes such use of force in response to specific acts of violence or destruction of property.

No non- or less-lethal projectiles may ever be aimed at the head, pelvis or back, or fired indiscriminately into a crowd, said the ruling, which also applies to any non-Denver officer deployed to the demonstrations.

Chemical agents or irritants may only be used after an order to disperse is issued and officers have allowed enough time and space for protesters to leave safely, it said.

Tyrone Campbell, a Denver Police spokesman, said the force would comply with the judge’s order.

Milo Schwab, an attorney for four of the plaintiffs, told Reuters that the ruling was “a humbling victory.”

“This will ensure that people protesting police brutality are not subject to police brutality,” he said. “Demonstrators in Denver are now safer from police brutality than anywhere else in the country.”"	right
iourlo	libertarian	FBI Horrified To Discover Ring Doorbells Can Tip Off Citizens To The Presence Of Federal Officers At Their Door	"FBI Horrified To Discover Ring Doorbells Can Tip Off Citizens To The Presence Of Federal Officers At Their Door

from the those-bastards-and-their-surreptitious-cameras dept

Ring's camera/doorbells may as well be branded with local law enforcement agency logos. Since Amazon acquired the company, Ring has cornered the law enforcement-adjacent market for home security products, partnering with hundreds of agencies to get Ring's products into the hands of residents. A lot of this flows directly through police departments, which can get them almost for free as long as they push citizens towards using Ring's snitch app, Neighbors, and allow Ring to handle the PR work.

So, it's hilarious to find out the FBI is concerned about Ring cameras, considering the company's unabashed love for all things law enforcement. The Intercept -- diving back into the ""Blue Leaks"" stash of exfiltrated law enforcement documents -- has posted an FBI ""Technical Analysis Bulletin"" [PDF] warning cops about the threat Ring cameras pose to cops. After celebrating the golden age of surveillance the Internet of Things has ushered in, the FBI notes that doorbell cameras see everyone who comes to someone's door -- even if it's people who'd rather the absent resident remained unaware of.

The document describes a 2017 incident in which FBI agents approached a New Orleans home to serve a search warrant and were caught on video. “Through the Wi-Fi doorbell system, the subject of the warrant remotely viewed the activity at his residence from another location and contacted his neighbor and landlord regarding the FBI’s presence there,” it states.

Ratted out by home security tech -- the kind often pushed on residents by law enforcement officers hoping to expand their surveillance networks by deputizing doorbells. Ring's cameras aren't just mute witnesses. Owners receive notifications when someone comes to their door and, depending on model, are able to hold conversations with them using built-in mics and speakers.

This means the sneak-and-peek feds might have been overhead discussing their tactical plans or specifics about the investigation. Hilarious. And this is how another FBI document on the subject of doorbells puts it, turning a normal home security device into a devious tool to be wielded against law enforcement:

“[S]ubject was able to see and hear everything happening at his residence” and possibly “covertly monitor law enforcement activity while law enforcement was on the premises…""

Covert monitoring is the best monitoring, as these FBI agents are well-aware. Sucks when it's the alleged perps doing the covert monitoring, I guess. And it sucks when the FBI decides now is the time to be hot and bothered when security cameras have been catching cops visiting/raiding properties for years. Audio recording isn't some new technology either, so if cops haven't been clued into this possibility already, they have no one to blame but themselves.

The documents are fascinating, and not just because they appear to turn Ring into a co-conspirator in crimes after so many years of being besties with law enforcement. It also shows how much goes unnoticed by people who routinely cite their years of training and experience when applying for search warrants. This should have been obvious from day one.

hjfmvo	libertarian	Want to Reform the Criminal Justice System? End the Drug War.	"Protesters say America's criminal justice system is unfair.

It is.

Courts are so jammed that innocent people plead guilty to avoid waiting years for a trial. Lawyers help rich people get special treatment. A jail stay is just as likely to teach you crime as it is to help you get a new start. Overcrowded prisons cost a fortune and increase suffering for both prisoners and guards.

There's one simple solution to most of these problems: End the war on drugs.

Our government has spent trillions of dollars trying to stop drug use.

It hasn't worked. More people now use more drugs than before the ""war"" began.

What drug prohibition did do is exactly what alcohol prohibition did a hundred years ago: increase conflict between police and citizens.

""It pitted police against the communities that they serve,"" says neuroscientist Carl Hart in my new video. Hart, former chair of Columbia University's Psychology department, grew up in a tough Miami neighborhood where he watched crack cocaine wreck lives. When he started researching drugs, he assumed that research would confirm the damage drugs did.

But ""one problem kept cropping up,"" he says in his soon-to-be-released book, Drug Use For Grown-Ups: Chasing Liberty in the Land of Fear, ""the evidence did not support the hypothesis. No one else's evidence did either.""

After 20 years of research, he concluded, ""I was wrong."" Now, he says, our drug laws do more harm than drugs.

Because drug sales are illegal, profits from selling drugs are huge. Since sellers can't rely on law enforcement to protect their property, they buy guns and form gangs.

Cigarettes harm people, too, but there are no violent cigarette gangs—no cigarette shootings—even though nicotine is more addictive than heroin, says our government. That's because tobacco is legal. Likewise, there are no longer violent liquor gangs. They vanished when prohibition ended.

But what about the opioid epidemic? Lots of Americans die from overdoses!

Hart blames the drug war for that, too. Yes, opioids are legal, but their sale is tightly restricted.

""If drugs were over the counter, there would be fewer deaths?"" I asked.

""Of course,"" he responds. ""People die from opioids because they get tainted opioids….That would go away if we didn't have this war on drugs. Imagine if the only subject of any conversation about driving automobiles was fatal car crashes….So it is with the opioid epidemic.""

Drugs do harm many people, but in real life, replies Hart, ""I know tons of people who do drugs; they are public officials, captains of industry, and they're doing well. Drugs, including nicotine and heroin, make people feel better. That's why they are used.""

President Eisenhower warned about the military-industrial complex. America's drug war funds a prison-industrial complex. Hart says his years inside the well-funded research side of that complex showed him that any research not in support of the ""tough-on-drugs"" ideology is routinely dismissed to ""keep outrage stoked"" and funds coming in.

America locks up more than 2 million Americans. That's a higher percentage of our citizens, disproportionately black citizens, than any other country in the world.

""In every country with a more permissive drug regime, all outcomes are better,"" says Hart. Countries like Switzerland and Portugal, where drugs are decriminalized, ""don't have these problems that we have with drug overdoses.""

In 2001, Portugal decriminalized all drug use. Instead of punishing drug users, they offer medical help. Deaths from overdoses dropped sharply. In 2017, Portugal had only 4 deaths per million people. The United States had 217 per million.

""In a society, you will have people who misbehave, says Hart. ""But that doesn't mean you should punish all of us because someone can't handle this activity.""

He's right. It's time to end the drug war.

ic1af3	libertarian	Libertarians Want Trump to Pardon Edward Snowden	"Barely three days after President Donald Trump told reporters he “would take a very good look at” pardoning Edward Snowden, the Libertarian Party made a strong pitch for a complete pardon of the former government contractor who leaked classified material before fleeing to Russia in 2013.

“We believe that Edward Snowden committed no crime, but we would welcome the president pardoning Edward Snowden,” Libertarian Party Executive Director Dan Fishman told Newsmax on Monday.

Fishman added that ""if it would possibly persuade the president, we would add that pardoning Snowden would be among the greatest deeds any president has ever done to strengthen the country.""

In contrast to the several members of the House Armed Services Committee who warned Trump on Monday not to pardon the former government contractor, Fishman said that “Edward Snowden is the definition of a patriot. We encourage everyone not familiar with his story to see the movie ‘Citizenfour’ and to understand the critical role the independent press and responsible citizens working together play in our democracy.”

""Citizenfour"" is a 2013 independent movie in which filmmaker Laura Poitras and Guardian journalists Glenn Greenwald and Ewen MacAskill interview an anonymous figure about what he considers illegal spying by U.S. intelligence agencies. The figure later reveals himself to be Snowden, who was filmed in a Hong Kong hotel room before going into exile in Russia.

The pardoning of Snowden has been called for by several Libertarian leaders, notably past Libertarian presidential nominee and former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson. Former Texas Rep. and 1988 Libertarian presidential nominee Ron Paul has long hailed Snowden as a ""hero.""

Snowden, who reportedly made $1.2 million in speaking fees during his seven-year exile in Russia, would face criminal charges for leaking classified government documents if he returned to the U.S.

For years before his election as president, Trump referred to Snowden as a ""traitor"" and a ""spy who should be executed.""

ihifbp	libertarian	Tennessee Cops Raid Wrong Home, Point Guns at Naked Woman While Looking for Teen Suspect	"Three Tennessee officers have been decommissioned after raiding the wrong home with guns drawn and forcing a naked woman outside.

Officers with the Metro Nashville Police Department (MNPD) raided the home of Azaria Hines last Tuesday, WSMV reports. The unclothed Hines was asleep on her sofa after a late shift when she heard a banging outside. When she realized the commotion was coming from officers, Hines later said, she asked them to hold on. Her calls were ignored.

Body camera footage from the raid shows Hines attempting to ask the officers to wait while they break her door down with a battery ram, which occurred fewer than 30 seconds after they shouted warnings.

After smashing the door frame, officers burst through the door with guns drawn at a naked Hines. Hines attempted to reach for a shirt, but was prevented from clothing herself. Armed police rushed through the home and forced Hines' 3-year-old nephew and 15-year-old cousin outside the home.

Several minutes later, the officers told Hines they had the wrong home.

The police were looking for a 16-year-old in connection with some vehicle burglaries. Interim Chief John Drake confirmed in a Wednesday press conference that the address MNPD used to serve the search warrant was outdated. The department obtained the information through the Metropolitan Development and Housing Agency, which has not provided updates on residents since 2018, due to privacy concerns. Hines had only lived in the apartment for six months, and she had no connection to the teen.

Lt. Harrison Dooley, Sgt. Jeff Brown, and Officer Michael Richardson are currently decommissioned pending an investigation. The department will also review its search warrant procedures.

The department attempted to smooth things over with Hines by dropping off groceries. Hines wasn't impressed by the gesture, saying: ""Groceries isn't what I need. I need a peace of mind. I haven't had any sleep since this happened. I haven't had a whole night of sleep since this happened. I don't feel comfortable in my own home. My door is still not fixed all the way."""	right
mkk7je	libertarian	Black Americans flock to gun stores and clubs: 'I needed to protect myself'	"Janice Matthews* always knew she would be a gun owner someday. She was raised in Alabama where her family members rarely left their home unarmed. Still, after more than three decades in California she wasn’t in a rush to start shopping around at gun stores. Then the pandemic hit.

Matthews started hearing rumors of food shortages and noticed store shelves emptied by shoppers panic-buying everything from bullets to toilet paper. After her daughter moved out of their home, she was left with an empty nest and a lot of anxiety.

“I was thinking of what they predicted in the Bible and I thought I would have to protect the little bit that I had,” Matthews, 55, recalled.

So one day in the spring of last year, she waited six hours in line outside a northern California gun shop to become one of the millions of Americans who became first-time gun owners in 2020.

Americans bought a record number of firearms last year. An estimated 5 million people bought their first ever gun between March and August, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), a trade organization, and that number continued to climb throughout the year. Black Americans saw the highest increase in new gun owners of any demographic, the NSSF found, with gun ownership in the group up by a staggering 58.2%.

Though Black Americans have a multitude of reasons for buying a gun – some new gun owners told the Guardian about stress related to the pandemic, others about the anxiety of seeing scores of armed white protesters rallying against lockdown orders or the election results – many had a common experience in the process of obtaining one. They were met with apathy, and in some cases disrespect, from white gun store owners, gun club members and at shooting ranges.

The cold shoulder they received has pushed scores to join Black gun clubs and seek training from Black experts. “June 2020 – when the riots were hitting different cities – my students increased,” said Rogers Anderson, who is the commander of the Black Gun Owners Association’s Oakland/Bay Area chapter and conducts training sessions at northern California shooting ranges. “Now 99.9% of my students are either single Black women or Black women with children who fear for their safety,” Anderson said.

Janice Matthews is one of Anderson’s trainees. On the morning of 18 January, Martin Luther King Jr Day, Matthews and her friend Robin Lewis drove an hour to the Richmond Rod and Gun Club for a beginners shooting session. The duo joined a pair of veteran trainers and five other novice firearm users, all but one Black. They spent the morning in a small field carved into a maze-like shooting range, filling cardboard targets with bullets from pistols and shotguns.

They practiced aiming in small pockets of semi-enclosed space on the terrain, and lined up side by side to practice their stance, with Anderson correcting first-timers’ finger placement before telling the class to “pull the trigger”.

Matthews had sought out the training after being utterly disappointed last March when picking up her weapon – a 9mm handgun, selected on the recommendation of her brother. She found the store’s clerk to be unfriendly, rushing her out without showing her basic skills like locking and loading the gun.

“I didn’t feel any comfort once I brought the gun home because I didn’t know what I was doing,” she said. “I couldn’t pull it out, cause if I did, the person would use it on me.”

Her friend, Robin Lewis, said she had had a fear of guns ever since her brother was murdered in 2000. She went to the training on a whim. “Guns brought back traumatic triggers. I had never handled one and I had a fear of the unknown at first,” Lewis said. During the training in Richmond she fired handguns and rifles in a class that was half men and half women.

“Just looking at the world and all that’s going on I knew I needed to protect myself,” Lewis continued. “I didn’t know shooting could be a hobby, but it’s all about learning. The less you know the more you fear it.”

Once she gets more training under her belt, she wants to buy a 9mm handgun.

‘Education from someone who looks like me’

Black gun ownership – sometimes referred to as the Black tradition of arms – has seen many iterations. After the American civil war, newly freed Black people formed militias to defend themselves against white supremacist violence. Into the mid-20th century, civil rights activists such as Medgar Evers and Martin Luther King Jr were known to carry guns and groups like the Deacons for Defense in the south and Black Panthers wielded their firearms publicly as a part of their activism.

In recent months, Black gun owners with groups like the Not Fucking Around Coalition (NFAC) have marched with long guns slung across their chest and handguns visible in their holsters during protests over Covid-19 restrictions and demonstrations demanding justice for George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.

Guns have continued to fly off store shelves amid the unrest following Donald Trump’s election defeat and the lingering pain around killings of Americans such as Ahmaud Arbery, who was shot and killed while on a run through a Georgia neighborhood.

“In times of uncertainty people want to be able to have the means to defend themselves,” said Robert J Cottrol, a law professor at George Washington University. “People are worried that they’re not being protected and they’ll have to do it themselves.”

“Fear of crime and it being a hobby are not mutually exclusive. And the police are not always able to protect you,” he added.

Nathan Adams, a 46-year-old northern California business owner, said he supported California’s strict gun laws before the 2020 election. But the intense focus on entrenched racism in policing led him to conclude that, “some law enforcement and some extremist groups are one in the same.”

“People are tired of this stuff, me included. And if buying firearms is the route we have to go down to make sure that things don’t get shady over my tail light, then so be it,” Adams said after a session on the Richmond training ground.

“None of the traditional groups were all that appealing. They’re always defending the second amendment unless it comes down to a minority, then they’re crickets. I didn’t wanna give my membership dollars to them,” he continued.

“I would rather get the education from someone who looks like me instead of someone who says ‘lemme help this boy,’ echoed Delon Atkins, who attends trainings alongside Adams and said he had begun dabbling in firearms at the beginning of the pandemic. “I experienced that and didn’t like it. Being in an environment where I’m the only Black person made me wanna put my shield and armor up.”

Mainly white conservative groups such as the National Rifle Association (NRA) have dominated the second amendment conversation since the late 90s and into the new millennium.

In times of uncertainty people want to be able to have the means to defend themselves Robert J Cottrol

Tired of the NRA’s failure to reach out to Black communities and vilification of slain Black gun owners, Black gun owners formed their own affinity groups like BGOA and the National African American Gun Association (Naaga) to encourage other Black Americans to embrace their right to own firearms and educate them on gun safety. Their membership only grew amid killings like the one of Philando Castile in Minnesota and Alton Sterling in Louisiana.

“The value of these groups is learning with people who know your struggle and understand what’s happening and has been happening with this country,” said Anubis Heru, the owner of the 1770 Armory and Gun Club Denver, Colorado’s first Black-owned firearm store and simulator range. “Black people and women of color like to come to our facility because we’re not the typical redneck with a tattoo of the Three Percenters.”

“Why would you want the racists to be the only ones with knowledge of firearms?” echoed Maj Toure, the founder of Black Guns Matter, a firearm education program aimed at new gun owners in urban communities across the US. “The seed was in the ground already, so when Covid happened there was fertile soil for us to reach Black people and teach them basic firearm safety.”

‘There’s empowerment’

Geneva and Jonathan Solomon opened their Los Angeles gun store, Redstone Firearm, in 2016. They were met with appreciation from people who were jaded by their experiences with other gun store owners, the couple said, especially as the pandemic worsened and civil unrest and racial strife became more prevalent.

They have received racist messages and threats since the store’s opening, though, and the abuse has escalated throughout months of racial tension and social unrest. They have even struggled to retain vendors once they discover that the Solomons are Black.

“We continually get death threats, we get phone calls and emails saying, ‘You niggers shouldn’t be selling guns,’” Jonathan Solomon said. “I don’t think it’s going to stop especially as more groups see that Black people are gonna start shooting back and won’t be easy targets any more.”

Even with the racism they face, the Solomons say their business is growing, especially as more people learn they are Black-owned. They hope that once the spread of Covid ebbs, and racial tensions cool, Black Americans will begin to participate in shooting competitions and have a greater presence throughout the industry.

“I really hope that the gun owners who bought them on a whim and aren’t really interested sell their guns. But for those who truly want to grow from beginner to intermediate, I want them to keep that momentum,” Geneva Solomon said. “I want to see more Black people get into competitive shooting. I want to see more family bonding around it.”

Solomon’s particularly impressed with the rise in gun ownership among Black women. “It’s amazing that Black women are having these conversations and are making these decisions for themselves,” she said. “There may be an undertone of fear but there’s also empowerment to say, ‘You’re not gonna punk me.’”

Janice Matthews has enjoyed training among other Black people and hopes to also shoot with an all-Black female cohort. Having gotten to grips with her handgun, she now plans to build her own rifle.

She was deeply saddened by the recent high-profile mass shootings in Boulder, Colorado, and Orange, California, she said, and was especially angered by the racial implications of the murders in Atlanta, Georgia.

“I don’t like racism at all so that shooting definitely made me mad,” Matthews said. She wanted to continue her own training, she added, to develop as a responsible gun owner.

Nathan Adams said he planned to continue to attend BGOA trainings and be more involved with the group. Early in his gun ownership, he wondered if people would begin to stereotype him when he posted pictures with his firearm to social media. Amid high-profile mass shootings, Adams wondered if he and his fellow Black marksmen were “going to be lumped in with Proud Boy types”.

“People are gonna put their own spin on it and as a part of a community that’s used to being misconstrued I can’t concern myself with that,” Adams said. “We know why we’re doing this and safety is our number one concern.”

munlst	libertarian	"The US Government seized this man's brand-new F-250 after they found five loose bullets (without a gun), and deemed them ""munitions of war."" Time to end Civil Asset Forfeiture."	"When Gerardo Serrano stopped in Eagle Pass, Texas, to snap some pictures of the U.S.-Mexico border, he thought the photos would be free. He paid with his vehicle.

In September 2015, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seized the brand-new F-250 truck via civil forfeiture, which allows the government to take property from people merely suspected of committing a crime. Serrano's error: After agents pulled him over for the pictures, and after Serrano refused to surrender the password to his phone, they located five loose bullets in his vehicle (without a gun), and deemed them ""munitions of war."" He was detained for several hours and told to walk home.

For years, the government refused to properly adjudicate the matter. Not only was Serrano never charged with a crime, but CBP never filed a formal forfeiture complaint: It just took Serrano's property and sat on it while his pleas fell on deaf ears. He eventually shelled out $3,800 to challenge the move in federal court, and still heard nothing—until he filed a lawsuit against the agency for violation of due process.

At that point, CBP suddenly came around and returned the property. ""The upshot is that Serrano lost his property for two years based on nothing more than a probable cause determination by CBP agents who were clearly irritated by his refusal to provide his iPhone password,"" wrote Reason's Jacob Sullum last year. ""Such delays are built into modern forfeiture procedures, which include an 'administrative' phase during which a property owner can plead for mercy from the same agency that took his stuff and would receive the proceeds from selling it.""

On Monday the Supreme Court declined to hear his case. That demurral reinforces the position taken by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals: that the government does not violate someone's due process when they take their property without a hearing. Other circuits have ruled to the contrary.

""When the agents seized my truck, I couldn't believe it was happening to me,"" said Serrano in a statement. ""And now I'm back in the Twilight Zone, thinking this can't be real. How can the courts just ignore this? And how can an ordinary person afford to wait years after the government takes their car?""

Serrano was given several options immediately following the seizure, from doing nothing to paying the vehicle's full market value to get it back. Noticeably absent from the list: a hearing. Given what happened today, that unfortunately won't change anytime soon."	right

j8crwm	libertarian	Massachusetts and Alaska May Join Maine in Letting Voters Rank Their Choices	"Voters in Massachusetts and Alaska will decide in November whether they want to implement ranked-choice voting for some of their state races.

If voters approve, they'll join Maine, which in November will be the first state to use ranked-choice voting for the presidential race.

In ranked-choice voting (sometimes called ""instant runoff voting""), citizens don't just select one of the candidates for an office (though they can if they want to). They are permitted to rank each of the candidates on the basis of preference.

To win a ranked-choice election, one must receive more than 50 percent of the vote, not just a plurality. If no candidate has a majority, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated from contention. Then the votes are tallied again. If you ranked the eliminated candidate as your first choice, your second choice is instead tallied as your vote. And so the process goes until a candidate gets more than 50 percent.

In Maine, voters approved a proposition to introduce ranked-choice voting there for some state and federal elections in 2016. The state's Republican Party has been fighting it ever since, unsuccessfully. In 2018, ranked-choice voting contributed to the ouster of a GOP incumbent.

In Massachusetts, Question 2 will ask voters if they want ranked-choice voting for state officials and lawmakers, members of Congress, and some county offices. It would not implement ranked-choice voting in presidential races.

In Alaska, Ballot Measure 2 combines ranked-choice voting with open primaries. If it becomes law, candidates for state or congressional offices will first run in a single open primary where candidates for each office all face each other, regardless of party. After the vote, the top four (regardless of party) will face each other again in the general election. There voters will have the option to rank the four candidates for each seat, and then the rules of ranked-choice voting will be followed.

Why bother with such a complicated system? Proponents argue that under ranked-choice voting, you aren't ""throwing your vote away"" by supporting a third-party candidate and you don't have to feel beholden to the two-party model. In Maine, for example, voters will be able to vote for Libertarian candidate Jo Jorgensen or Green candidate Howie Hawkins and still also support either Joe Biden or Donald Trump. Research from FairVote, an activist organization supporting and promoting ranked-choice voting, found that voter turnout trends upwards in cities that have implemented ranked-choice voting.

All of this may explain why the state Libertarian Party affiliates in both Massachusetts and Alaska are supporting these ballot measures.

In Maine, voters have consistently shown support for implementation. But in Massachusetts, polling is currently divided almost evenly between support and opposition, with more than a quarter of voters undecided. In Alaska, it's polling ahead, 59 to 17 percent. Even so, the most recent poll had about a quarter of the voters undecided.

Ranked choice is not perfect, and it comes with its own set of frustrations. If you support only one of the candidates and that candidate does poorly, then your vote can get tossed out and mean nothing, just like in a winner-takes-all elections. It doesn't even necessarily make it easier for a third-party candidate to win. But it does mean that major party candidates cannot simply ignore the interests of more independent voters and run simply by appealing to their bases. Those independent voters' second choice might be what determines the election."	right
i2i342	libertarian	Let Her Speak event aims to get Jo Jorgensen on debate stage against President Trump, Biden	"The Harris County Libertarian Party is hosting an event that attempts to get Jo Jorgensen on the debate stage against President Donald Trump and democratic challenger Joe Biden.

On Saturday, Aug. 8, at 11:30 a.m., protesters meet for Let Her Speak at 2706 White Oak Drive, Houston. The group will decorate their cars, “go live” on social media and drive through the Heights and Montrose areas in a bid to get Jorgensen to Cleveland on Sept. 29 for the next presidential debate.

Election 2020: Wesley Hunt is ready to contest Fletcher for TX-7

Current restrictions set by the Commission on Presidential Debates limit participation to candidates that are polling at 15 percent or higher in at least five national polls. Even though Jorgensen is on the ballot in 36 states, including Texas, according to the Libertarian Party’s official website, she doesn’t meet the threshold to join the debate.

“The idea is to have a socially distanced and peaceful protest in order to bring attention to the fact that the Libertarian Party candidate for president, Dr. Jo Jorgensen, is being ignored by the Commission on Presidential Debates,” said Elliot Scheirman, who is one of the protest’s hosts. He is also running for United States Congress in Houston’s second congressional district, which is currently occupied by U.S. Rep. Dan Crenshaw.

With 107 confirmed protests happening across the country on Aug. 8, the Libertarian Party is hoping to get CPD’s attention.

“The catch?”, the Harris County Libertarian Party’s press release notes, “Most of these polls do not even mention a third-party candidate... Voters are being left in the dark...”

However, Jorgensen and Libertarian officials said they believe Americans want a viable third option.

According to a 2017 Gallup poll, 77 percent of independent voters favor having a third major party. And according to a 2020 Gallup poll conducted this summer, 40 percent of Americans identify as independent.

“There’s an appetite here,” said Scheirman. “People are walking away from the duopoly of the Republicans and Democrats when they see that we have offerings of people who are qualified, articulate, are able to communicate a message that shows how we can solve problems that we have in society without resorting to government force, rather working on voluntary solutions.”

Jorgensen, who received her Ph. D. in Organizational Psychology from Clemson University where she is also a senior lecturer in psychology, hopes she can capture this sentiment. The top issues on her presidential platform include goals to end foreign wars, eliminate the federal debt and deficit, lower high healthcare costs and lower incarceration rates.

ELECTION 2020: U.S. Rep. Lizzie Fletcher faces a challenge for TX7

“Government is too big, too bossy, too nosy, and, worst of all, often hurts the very people it intends to help. The government doesn’t work; liberty and freedom do,” said Jorgensen in a press release.

Scheirman said he also wants to challenge the stereotype that Libertarians are, “just Republicans who like weed."" He said the Libertarian party draws in Republicans and Democrats, as well as, “people who never wanted to be either.”

He believes Libertarian policy positions are rooted in individual choice, individual consent, and individual rights. According to Scheirman, people should be able to live their lives however they want, free from persecution, with dignity, as long as they’re not harming others in the process.

“That’s something that appeals to a lot of people,” said Scheirman. “At the end of the day, our motto is: Live and Let Live.”

WASHINGTON, D.C.—Congresspeople from both parties condemned the attack on the Capitol that occurred Wednesday, pointing out that they're the only criminals allowed in the building.

Capitol police removed the unauthorized criminals from the Capitol Building, allowing the officially voted-in criminals to resume operations.

""We would like to remind Americans that we are the only looters allowed in here,"" said Nancy Pelosi after order was restored to the House. ""Remember, you must show your official congressperson identification to prove you're an approved looter to get in here. Unauthorized looters will be removed from Capitol grounds.""

""Now, who wants to start some foreign wars?""

n6gw2j	libertarian	Police murder man armed at protest, claim the shooting is justified because he was armed. If being armed is a justification for the state to murder you, you don't like have the right to be armed.	"Through a presentation that lasted hours, the state of Nevada brought all it could to conjure justification for the cold-blooded killing of Jorge Gomez in 2020 during protests in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and justice for George Floyd. In what can only be called a thorough collaboration, the Las Vegas Metro Police Department, Clark County and the district attorney, Steve Wolfson, presented a woefully incomplete evaluation of the killing of a brother, friend and son of our community, finding it both legitimate and defensible. The so-called “Public Fact Finding Review” was a political exercise in gaslighting and manipulation at a grand scale, one in which officials vastly downplayed officers’ failure to uphold their own use of force and de-escalation policies, leading to an entirely avoidable killing.

Their story represents the “official” narrative on behalf of a community of millions of people in the Las Vegas valley. It is despicable for several reasons. The “facts” found by officials were demonstrably prejudiced to totally incriminate Jorge Gomez, though he was not on trial — he was executed by police while walking. By their own admission, the forensic evidence showed Gomez never once fired the guns in his possession (and videos of the scene show he never aimed them, either). Unsurprisingly, these actual facts did not in any way result in accountability for the officers for killing a civilian. According to the state, he was responsible for his own killing.

The criminal-legal system criminalized the person killed by listing several “applicable charges had Gomez survived:” four counts of assault with a deadly weapon, carrying a concealed weapon and possession of a short-barreled rifle. The only thing public about the review was that people were allowed into [already] public chambers to view the highly prejudicial presentation and were afforded the opportunity to submit questions that were screened by an official aligned with the state who then decided whether or not to ask them. That person, hearing master Chip Siegel, was formerly a Clark County district attorney and has since worked in private practice out of the Wolfson & Glass building downtown; this suggests that the current D.A. is his landlord of many years.

The incident in question, which occurred during a frenzied night of protests against racist police officers and state violence, was further framed by authorities within the broader ideological bounds of reactionary, conservative politics that views Black Lives Matter movements as inherently radical and a threat. In addition to the literal attack against Jorge Gomez and his right to openly carry firearms under state law, the fact-finding review served as ideological fodder to delegitimize and criminalize perfectly legal public assembly driven only by deep indignation against racist police violence—specifically when done in the name of Black Lives Matter. In the eyes of the law, protests in solidarity with and for Black communities warrant lethal police brutality.

The Force Investigation Team (FIT) alleged that on the night in question, Gomez was heckling officers on the other side of the “skirmish line”—a police formation utilized to control an “unauthorized gathering”—and that this one man intimidated and posed a threat to them, despite their body armor, rifles and full cover of the law. In actuality, the skirmish line is nothing more than the thin blue wall that delineates fascist police control and associated violence and requires the total submission of civilians and compliance with even the most outlandish officer commands—at risk of death.

A revenge killing?

Again drawing on the hysteria of anti-BLM ideology, testifying authorities conflated another [blue] line: between the shooting of a police officer that happened blocks away and the non-actions of Jorge Gomez, who, again, never pointed his weapons at officers. One official provided a deceptive narrative suggesting that the (unfounded) fears of officers that Jorge Lopez might shoot at them was sufficient to justify his killing. In other words, because ""one of us had been shot”—as ombudsman Josh Tomsheck put it, while ostensibly representing both the family and the public during the hearing—it was open shooting season on anyone perceived to be a threat by ramped-up officers. (Tomsheck is a former Clark County district attorney, spouse to a Las Vegas municipal court judge and the popular choice for troublesome cops in need of legal defense.)

As Gomez was moving away from the officers, they created an encounter where there had been none by firing less-lethal rounds at Gomez, who fell to the ground and then got up and continued to flee. Investigators alleged that officers mistook the sound of their own low-lethal rounds for a shot fired by Gomez. I would posit that it was not a mistake, but a further escalation by surrounding officers who then unloaded 19 rounds at him. The “mistake” was justified because officers receive no training on distinguishing between the sound of low-lethal rounds and deadly ones, which was corroborated by both Tomsheck and Metro’s force investigation team lead whom he was questioning.

After what many legal observers called a sham of a review, Gomez’s family shared their truths to the media outside of the commission building, standing alongside others who have experienced similar tragedies, together known as Families United 4 Justice Las Vegas. Behind them was the crowd that had for hours protested against Metro, police violence, and DA Steve Wolfson and chanted in support of Gomez; his family could hear from the inside.

His mom, Jeanne Llera, criticized how the review villainized, slandered and conspired against her son, painting him as some “radicalized” individual who intended to cause violence by showing his text messages and social media activity—which the investigators dug up after his killing in an attempt to add credence to their version of events. She urged support for two pending bills at the Legislature: AB131, to require body-worn cameras for all officers, and AB 133, revising the conditions for justified use of lethal force by police. Sadly, neither of these provisions would have prevented Gomez’s death with certainty.

Nevada police kill a lot — and always get away with it

The lawyer representing the Gomez family cut to the heart of the review: “What we saw was a circus. A pre-scripted hearing. They dragged Jorge Gomez’s name through the mud…. This is the city that is supposed to be the entertainment capital of the world. It’s embarrassing. This is what Las Vegas leadership showed the world.” He also stated that they weren’t asking anyone to defund the police. This despite the fact that the lawyer's office was raided by LVMPD with the permission of a judge who is the son of the current mayor of Las Vegas. The judicial branch provided cover for direct intimidation.

Eighty-six families have lost a loved one to LVMPD’s violence, and 86 times LVMPD officers have evaded legal repercussions. Surely, defunding a police force that has not once been held to account would be a measure of responsibility and repair to the families who have lost much more?

Police violence is a national crisis of international proportions.

The fourth highest rate in the nation of fatal encounters between police and civilians occurs right here in Nevada. It is quite simple to see why: consider the institutional prerogatives that solely uphold police narratives—the guise of false fact-finding reviews; legislative priorities that do as little as possible to uproot harmful police practices; and a culture of deference to law enforcement—and the fact that LVMPD’s citizen review board never disputes the agency it ostensibly oversees. There’s no reason for police to de-escalate a tense situation when the officers know they later will be “proven” justified in their actions. That’s what happened in Sparks in Northern Nevada in 2019 when 18 yr-old Miciah Lee, who was experiencing a suicidal emergency, was met with militarized police and a rain of bullets instead of compassionate care. Those officers, as in Gomez’s case, were also repeat-killers.

Criminal justice reform advocate Glenn E. Martin has said, “Those closest to the problem are closest to the solution.” An effective way to end the onslaught of police brutality in Nevada would be to support the 40 demands drawn up by Families United 4 Justice Las Vegas (FU4JLV)—a local coalition of directly affected families and survivors of police violence. They know the “fact” finding review is an absurd and insulting process, and it is a target of their petition. Meanwhile, it is expected that District Attorney Wolfson will soon announce that the officers were found justified in their actions under the law, one in a long line of similar pronouncements over many years. And as virtually all killings by police nationwide culminate the same way, it is by no means a uniquely Nevadan tradition.

An international commission of human rights experts from twelve countries recently concluded an inquiry into police brutality in the United States. They found that the routine practices and cases of brutality are of a severity constituting crimes against humanity and urged action from the International Criminal Court. Some of the same practices decried by the commission are evident in the case of Jorge Gomez’s death. Knowing the rates of police killing in Nevada and the consistent evasion of accountability and justice, if we heed the calls not to defund the police and not to dismantle a system that has always resisted reforms aimed at preventing routinized violence, we will surely see more senseless killings despicably justified by the state. We will see a crisis endure.

gjluuw	libertarian	Most of the drug arrests in the U.S involve a gram or less and 70% are for marijuana	"In the long-running television drama “Breaking Bad,” viewers watched the moral devolution of Walter White, a cancer-stricken high school chemistry teacher who tried to provide for the financial future of his family by cooking methamphetamine. He changed from a good man caught in a bad situation into a sociopathic offender who ruled over a crystal meth empire.

Walter White represents the sort of drug offender who justifies serious punishment. He earned enormous amounts of money by producing and distributing vast amounts of harmful drugs.

U.S. drug laws are designed as if every offender was a dedicated criminal like Walter White, treating the possession or sale of even small quantities of illegal drugs as a serious crime requiring serious punishment.

I have studied the war on drugs for a number of years. Last December, my colleagues and I published a study on U.S. drug arrests, showing that roughly two out of every three arrests by state and local law enforcement target small-time offenders who are carrying less than a gram of illegal drugs.

Looking at the drugs numbers

Virtually all states treat as felonies the sale of any amount of illegal drugs. The thinking behind these laws is that you cannot catch the big fish without catching some minnows as well.

Many states also treat the mere possession of any amount of a hard drugs, such as cocaine, heroin or meth/amphetamine, as a felony.

Previous studies of quantities in drug arrests have principally drawn on two sets of data: periodic surveys of prison inmates, and traffic stop data collected in response to racial profiling lawsuits.

Both data sets are relatively small and somewhat limited. The prisoner surveys make no effort to verify prisoners’ descriptions of their crimes, and the traffic stop data deals with only drugs found in cars.

Yet comprehensive data on drug quantities in arrests does exist. The FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System collects this information. NIBRS only began in the early 1990s though, and it is a voluntary reporting program. Police departments do not have to submit data, and most do not. As of 2003, about 20% of police agencies from 29 different states reported data.

We wanted to find out how often the police made arrests involving large quantities of drugs. To make things manageable, we narrowed our study to three evenly spaced years, 2004, 2008 and 2012. The resulting data set contained over a million cases, with usable data found in over 700,000 cases.

We believe our study is the most comprehensive study of drug arrest quantity undertaken to date. Some previous studies make assumptions about quantity based on whether the person was arrested for simple possession as opposed to possession for sale, but ours was the first study to use NIBRS numbers on drug quantity in a comprehensive way.

Who gets caught

Our study found that, by and large, state and local police agencies are arresting small fish, not big ones.

Two out of three drug offenders arrested by state and local law enforcement possess or sell a gram or less at the time of arrest. Furthermore, about 40% of arrests for hard drug are for trace amounts – a quarter of a gram or less.

Because possessing any amount of a hard drug and selling any illegal drug is a felony in virtually every state, the small size of these quantities matter. They suggest that very minor offenders face felony liability. Felony convictions make it difficult for ex-offenders to secure good jobs. They carry many other harmful collateral consequences.

There are few truly big, or even medium-sized, offenders in the remaining arrests. Arrests for quantities of hard drugs above five grams range between 15 and 20 percent of all arrests, and arrests for a kilogram or more are less than 1%.

Racial disparities

What’s more, the racial distribution of these small quantity arrests reveal importance differences between arrests for different types of drugs.

Our study confirms that blacks are disproportionately arrested for crack cocaine offenses, as are whites for meth/amphetamine and heroin offenses. When it comes to possession of a quarter gram or less, police arrest almost twice as many blacks as whites for crack cocaine. However, they arrest almost four times as many whites as blacks for heroin and eight times as many whites as blacks for meth/amphetamine.

Offenders of color are, by and large, not significantly more serious offenders in terms of quantity of drugs. They just possess and sell drugs that are the most frequent target of arrest. Our study showed about twice as many arrests for crack cocaine as for meth/amphetamine and almost four times as many arrests for crack cocaine as for heroin.

Finally, this study shows that 71% of drug arrests are not for hard drugs, but for marijuana. The majority of those arrests are also for tiny quantities: 28% for trace amounts and almost 50% for a gram or less.

Once again, blacks are disproportionately arrested for marijuana offenses, making up about a quarter of all marijuana arrests despite being about 13% of the population.

Illegal drugs are ultimately sold in small quantities to users, so it’s not surprising that there are more small quantity offenders in the pool of drug arrestees. But this study suggests that the majority of state and local drug enforcement resources are spent catching these small fish. The drug war is not being waged primarily against the Walter Whites, but against much less serious offenders.

ilq9tr	libertarian	U.S. court: Mass surveillance program exposed by Snowden was illegal	"FILE PHOTO: Edward Snowden gestures as he speaks via livestream at Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal, November 4, 2019. REUTERS/Rafael Marchante

(Reuters) - Seven years after former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden blew the whistle on the mass surveillance of Americans’ telephone records, an appeals court has found the program was unlawful - and that the U.S. intelligence leaders who publicly defended it were not telling the truth.

In a ruling handed down on Wednesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said the warrantless telephone dragnet that secretly collected millions of Americans’ telephone records violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and may well have been unconstitutional.

Snowden, who fled to Russia in the aftermath of the 2013 disclosures and still faces U.S. espionage charges, said on Twitter that the ruling was a vindication of his decision to go public with evidence of the National Security Agency’s domestic eavesdropping operation.

“I never imagined that I would live to see our courts condemn the NSA’s activities as unlawful and in the same ruling credit me for exposing them,” Snowden said in a message posted to Twitter.

Evidence that the NSA was secretly building a vast database of U.S. telephone records - the who, the how, the when, and the where of millions of mobile calls - was the first and arguably the most explosive of the Snowden revelations published by the Guardian newspaper in 2013.

Up until that moment, top intelligence officials publicly insisted the NSA never knowingly collected information on Americans at all. After the program’s exposure, U.S. officials fell back on the argument that the spying had played a crucial role in fighting domestic extremism, citing in particular the case of four San Diego residents who were accused of providing aid to religious fanatics in Somalia.

U.S. officials insisted that the four - Basaaly Saeed Moalin, Ahmed Nasir Taalil Mohamud, Mohamed Mohamud, and Issa Doreh - were convicted in 2013 thanks to the NSA’s telephone record spying, but the Ninth Circuit ruled Wednesday that those claims were “inconsistent with the contents of the classified record.”

The ruling will not affect the convictions of Moalin and his fellow defendants; the court ruled the illegal surveillance did not taint the evidence introduced at their trial. Nevertheless, watchdog groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, which helped bring the case to appeal, welcomed the judges’ verdict on the NSA’s spy program.

“Today’s ruling is a victory for our privacy rights,” the ACLU said in a statement, saying it “makes plain that the NSA’s bulk collection of Americans’ phone records violated the Constitution.”"	right
kzbdb5	libertarian	China forcefully harvests organs from detainees, tribunal concludes	"LONDON — The organs of members of marginalized groups detained in Chinese prison camps are being forcefully harvested — sometimes when patients are still alive, an international tribunal sitting in London has concluded.

Some of the more than 1.5 million detainees in Chinese prison camps are being killed for their organs to serve a booming transplant trade that is worth some $1 billion a year, concluded the China Tribunal, an independent body tasked with investigating organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience in the authoritarian state.

“Forced organ harvesting has been committed for years throughout China on a significant scale,” the tribunal concluded in its final judgment Monday. The practice is “of unmatched wickedness — on a death for death basis — with the killings by mass crimes committed in the last century,” it added.

In 2014, state media reported that China would phase out the practice of taking organs from executed prisoners and said it would rely instead on a national organ donation system.

The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Tuesday was not immediately available to comment on the tribunal's findings.

In a statement released alongside the final judgment, the tribunal said many of those affected were practitioners of Falun Gong, a spiritual discipline that China banned in the 1990s and has called an “evil cult.” The tribunal added that it was possible that Uighur Muslims — an ethnic minority who are currently being detained in vast numbers in western China — were also being targeted.

The tribunal is chaired by Sir Geoffrey Nice, who worked as a prosecutor at the international tribunal for crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia.

“Falun Gong practitioners have been one — and probably the main — source of organ supply,” the judgment read, while “the concerted persecution and medical testing of the Uyghurs is more recent,” using a different spelling of the minority group's name. It warned, however, that the scale of medical testing of the Uighur Muslims meant they could end up being used as an ""organ bank.""

The tribunal that delivered its judgment in London was initiated by the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China — a not-for-profit coalition including lawyers, academics, human rights advocates and medical professionals.

Allegations of forced organ harvesting first came to light in 2001, after a boom in transplant activity was registered in China, with wait times becoming unusually short, the statement said. Chinese websites advertised hearts, lungs and kidneys for sale and available to book in advance, suggesting that the victims were killed on demand, it added.

On Monday, the tribunal concluded that there was “numerical evidence” of the “impossibility of there being anything like sufficient ‘eligible donors’ under the recently formed PRC [People’s Republic of China] voluntary donor scheme for that number of transplant operations.”

The tribunal added that witnesses, experts and investigators had told of how Falun Gong practitioners continued to be killed in order for their organs to be extracted. It added that forced organ harvesting was also being performed while victims are still alive, killing the person in the process.

The statement recalled how one witness, Dr. Enver Tohti, told of how as a surgeon in China he had been required to perform organ extractions. Referring to one instance in which he extracted an organ from a living patient, he said: “What I recall is with my scalpel, I tried to cut into his skin, there was blood to be seen. That indicates that the heart was still beating … At the same time, he was trying to resist my insertion, but he was too weak.”

Several survivors of prison camps told the tribunal of how they were subjected to physical examinations including blood tests, X-rays and ultrasounds, the statement said. “Experts report that the only reasonable explanation for these examinations was to ensure that victims’ organs were healthy and fit for transplantation,” it added. A healthy liver, for example, can reportedly be sold for some $160,000, according to the statement.

The tribunal concluded that it was ""beyond reasonable doubt"" that crimes against humanity had been committed against the Falun Gong and Uighur Muslims but that it could not prove that the killing of the Falun Gong amounted to genocide — because of the tribunal's inability to prove ‘intent’ to commit ‘genocide.’

In a statement accompanying the final judgment, the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China called on the international community to help bring an end to forced organ extraction.

“It is no longer a question of whether organ harvesting in China is happening, that dialogue is well and truly over. We need an urgent response to save these people’s lives,” Susie Hughes, executive director and co-founder of the coalition, said.

kz15vw	libertarian	Andrew Yang Calls For Decriminalization Of Sex Work In New York City	"New Your City mayoral candidate Andrew Yang on Friday called for the decriminalization of sex work in The Big Apple.

""There are many people working as migrant workers in the sex industry that have been victimized and harassed,"" he said in a Twitter clip of the appearance posted by editor Jacob Henry.

""We need to decriminalize sex work here in New York City to show a model for what the better approach is. Right now these workers are being pushed into the shadows and being killed, mistreated, systemically marginalized. Their pain is being ignored by our city and community, and we can and must do better.""

Yang appeared in the clip with New York City lawmaker Ron T. Kim, who said the politician's commitment came after a visit to the site where Yang Song died from a four-story fall during a ""racist & targeted police raid."" Kim noted that Song was previously sexually assaulted by a police officer.

The New Republic staff writer Melissa Gira Grant noted that Yang's campaign clarified that he supports the ""full decriminalization"" of consensual sex work and committed to cracking down on sex trafficking and individuals illegally soliciting minors.

As The Inquisitr reported, Yang previously proposed the partial decriminalization of sex work during his 2020 presidential campaign. The move received criticism from some, who noted that partial decriminalization — the Nordic/Swedish model — is not as effective at protecting sex workers as full decriminalization. Notably, Reason editor Elizabeth Nolan Brown claimed that his then-proposal would still require law enforcement to target individuals paying for sex and thus require stings on workers in the industry.

Elsewhere, University of Rhode Island professor Donna Hughes made a distinction between decriminalized and legalized prostitution. Notably, she said the former bars the state and law enforcement from intervening in any prostitution-related transaction or activities. The exception is if these activities are linked to situations where other laws apply.

A ProPublica investigation previously revealed that the NYPD officers who are tasked with policing the trade focus almost exclusively on minorities and profit off of the city's sex work industry by making as many arrests as possible with little evidence to support them.

""These arrests are based almost entirely on the word of cops, who say they are incentivized to round up as many 'bodies' as they can,"" the publication reported.

The outlet interviewed dozens of lawyers, cops, and other experts, who all did not believe that the city's arrest figures for people using prostitutes — almost everyone arrested for such crimes in the last four years was not white — accurately reflect the racial patterns of individuals who purchase sex in the region."	right

Erin Scott | Reuters

The White House will consider various options to pass an estimated $3 trillion economic recovery proposal, including splitting it into two bills, NBC News reported Monday. The New York Times first reported the potential for the Biden administration to craft two separate proposals. President Joe Biden aims to inject more money into the economy after this month's passage of his top priority, a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package. His administration and congressional Democrats hope to revamp the country's infrastructure, combat climate change and jolt an improving U.S. economy. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said earlier Monday that Biden had not decided how to proceed. In a statement to NBC News, she said, ""President Biden and his team are considering a range of potential options for how to invest in working families and reform our tax code so it rewards work, not wealth."" ""Those conversations are ongoing, so any speculation about future economic proposals is premature and not a reflection of the White House's thinking,"" she said.

The Times reported that the president's advisors will bring him a plan as soon as this week that would divide the recovery proposal into two planks. One would put money into boosting manufacturing, improving transportation systems, expanding broadband access and reducing carbon emissions, according to the newspaper. The other would focus on reducing economic inequities through investments in paid leave, universal pre-K and community college, the report said. The administration is leaning toward pursuing a bipartisan infrastructure bill first, then trying to pass larger pieces of the economic package through budget reconciliation, which would only require Democratic votes in the Senate, according to NBC.

It is unclear now whether Republicans would back either piece of Biden's recovery plan. The GOP has generally opposed the president's proposals to hike takes on corporations and the wealthiest Americans to pay for the initiatives. The Dow Jones Industrial average closed up more than 100 points Monday after the Times report. The reported price tag for Biden's plan is bigger than what most Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs expected, as most saw a roughly $2 trillion infrastructure package. Shares of Caterpillar ended modestly higher. Spokespeople for the White House, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., did not immediately respond to requests to comment.

Though politicians on both sides of the political aisle agree that U.S. infrastructure needs repair, they have not come to a consensus over which items to pay for and how best to finance the massive undertaking. Some moderates, including conservative Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, have made it clear they will only vote for a plan that makes a genuine attempt at bipartisanship and is nearly entirely paid for. Democrats approved the pandemic aid package on their own through budget reconciliation, and some members of the caucus have supported using the process to pass an infrastructure plan."	right
mdyni7	libertarian	New York City ends qualified immunity for police officers	"The New York City Council moved to end qualified immunity for police officers Thursday, making it the first big city in the nation to do so.

The measure passed as part of a broader overhaul of police practices.

The legal doctrine has for decades protected officers from lawsuits alleging misconduct against those they’re arresting, unless the officer had violated a clearly established constitutional right.

Qualified immunity first came under scrutiny during the racial injustice and police brutality protests that roiled the nation in the light of George Floyd’s death.

The city council said in a statement the bill would protect New Yorkers against unreasonable search and seizures and against excessive force, in addition to banning qualified immunity. The Big Apple joins two states, Colorado and Connecticut, in curbing the immunity defense.

GEORGE FLOYD: WHAT TO KNOW

The bill now goes to the desk of Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is expected to sign it.

At the same time, city lawmakers approved de Blasio’s plan to spend $72 million to improve police practices and accountability. This came after the city moved to divert $1 billion from the police budget last summer.

Another provision gives the Civilian Complaint Review Board, which investigates police misconduct, resources to investigate racial bias in policing, and it requires police to collect data on traffic stops, including the race of people apprehended.

Another resolution the council passed requires newly hired cops to live in New York City limits.

JURY SET FOR FORMER POLICE OFFICER'S TRIAL IN FLOYD DEATH; BEGINS MARCH 29

New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson said qualified immunity was ""rooted in our nation's history of systemic racism"" and ""should never have been allowed.

Opponents of the bill said it might discourage some from getting into law enforcement. ""Ending qualified immunity will prevent the best young men and women in our city from joining the police force,"" Councilman Robert F. Holden said as he voted no, according to the New York Times.

""New Yorkers are getting shot, and police officers are on the streets day and night, trying to stop the bloodshed,"" Patrick Lynch, president of the Police Benevolent Association, said in a statement, adding that the new bill would ""chill the operations of law enforcement."""	right
hpf7sy	libertarian	Majority of Public Favors Giving Civilians the Power to Sue Police Officers for Misconduct	"Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand how Americans are viewing proposals aimed at addressing policing in the aftermath of the widely covered deaths of several Black people in police custody, as well as widespread protests against racism and excessive use of force by police. For this analysis, we surveyed 4,708 U.S. adults in June 2020. Everyone who took part is a member of Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology. Here are the questions used for the report, along with responses, and its methodology.

With legislation to address racism and the use of excessive force by law enforcement stalled in Congress, there is broad public support in the United States for permitting citizens to sue police officers in order to hold them accountable for misconduct or using excessive force.

The legal doctrine of “qualified immunity” generally protects officers from being held personally liable in lawsuits unless they commit clear violations of law. A proposal to limit qualified immunity has emerged as a stumbling block in the congressional debate over policing.

Two-thirds of Americans (66%) say that civilians need to have the power to sue police officers to hold them accountable for misconduct and excessive use of force, even if that makes the officers’ jobs more difficult. Just 32% say that, in order for police officers to do their jobs effectively, they need to be shielded from such lawsuits.

About eight-in-ten Black adults (86%) favor permitting citizens to sue police officers to hold them accountable for misconduct, as do 75% of Hispanic adults and 60% of white adults. There also are sizable partisan differences in views of qualified immunity, reflecting the divisions over the issue in Congress. A majority of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (84%) say citizens need the power to sue police officers for the use of excessive force and misconduct, compared with 45% of Republicans and Republican leaners.

The national survey, conducted June 16-22 among 4,708 adults using Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel, finds that the public’s evaluations of police performance in several key areas have declined since the Center last explored attitudes among police officers and the public in 2016.

A 58% majority of Americans say police around the country do an excellent or good job of protecting people from crime, which is little changed from the share who said this four years ago (62%). However, there have been double-digit declines in the shares who say police forces do an excellent or good job of using the right amount of force for each situation (from 45% in 2016 to 35% today), treating racial and ethnic groups equally (47% to 34%) and holding officers accountable when misconduct occurs (44% to 31%).

The declines on all three measures have been comparable among Black and white adults. Democrats are far less positive about police performance than they were in 2016, while the change among Republicans has been less pronounced.

For example, just 10% of Democrats say police around the country do an excellent or good job in treating racial and ethnic groups equally, down from 27% in 2016. Nearly two-thirds of Republicans (64%) have a positive view of how police around the country do in treating racial and ethnic groups equally, which is a modest decline from four years ago (71%).

The survey finds little support for reducing spending on policing. Just 25% of Americans say spending on policing in their area should be decreased, with only 12% saying it should be decreased a lot; another 14% say it should be reduced a little.

A 73% majority say that spending on their local police should stay about the same as it is now (42%) or be increased from its current level (31%). While Black adults are more likely than whites to favor cuts in police budgets, fewer than half of Black adults (42%) say spending on policing in their areas should be reduced. That is double the share of white adults who favor cutting funding for their local police (21%).

There also are sizable age differences in views of funding for policing. Among both Black and white adults, those under age 50 are far more likely to support decreased funding for police in their areas than are those 50 and older.

The survey finds that Americans overwhelmingly favor requiring police to be trained in nonviolent alternatives to deadly force; 92% support this proposal, including 71% who strongly favor it.

Several other policing proposals draw broad support as well: 90% of the public favors a federal government database to track officers accused of misconduct. Three-quarters support giving civilian oversight boards the power to investigate and discipline officers accused of misconduct, and similar shares favor requiring officers to live in the places they police and outlawing police use of chokeholds or strangleholds.

While majorities of both parties and of Black, white and Hispanic adults favor each of these proposals, there are substantial differences in intensity of support on most of them. For example, while large shares of Black (87%) and white adults (71%) favor outlawing police use of chokeholds or strangleholds, nearly three-quarters of Black adults (74%) strongly favor this proposal, compared with fewer than half of white adults (44%).

Wide racial, partisan gaps in views of police performance

Americans are divided along partisan and racial lines in their evaluations of police. Across four measures of police performance, white adults are consistently more positive about the performance of police around the country than Black adults, and Republicans are much more positive than Democrats. While the partisan divide in positive evaluations of the police on most of these dimensions is nearly as wide among whites as it is overall, Black Democrats are more likely than their white counterparts to say that the police perform poorly.

Overall, a majority of Americans (58%) say that police around the country are doing an excellent or good job of protecting people from crimes – a view held by 78% of Republicans and Republican leaners but 43% of Democrats and Democratic leaners. Two-thirds of white adults (67%) say the police are doing a good or excellent job of protecting people, while just 28% of Black adults say the same. Half of Hispanic adults say police do an excellent or good job of protecting people.

There are racial and ethnic divides among Democrats in these views: While just 27% of Black Democrats say police do an excellent or good job protecting people from crime (and fully 72% say they do a poor job of this), about half of white Democrats (49%) and 42% of Hispanic Democrats say the same.

Public ratings of the police in three other areas – using the right amount of force for each situation, treating racial and ethnic groups equally and holding officers accountable when misconduct occurs – are considerably more negative, with more than six-in-ten Americans rating police performance in these domains as only fair or poor. Black Americans are especially likely to rate police negatively in each of these areas.

However, majorities of Republicans say that police are doing an excellent or good job of using the right amount of force for each situation (61%) and treating racial and ethnic groups equally (64%). About half of Republicans (51%) say that police around the country are doing an excellent or good job of holding officers accountable when misconduct occurs. Fewer than two-in-ten Democrats rate police positively in these areas.

While only about one-in-ten white Democrats and Black Democrats rate police performance in these three areas positively, Black Democrats are significantly more likely than white Democrats to say police are doing a poor job in each of these areas. For example, three-quarters of Black Democrats say that police are doing a poor job of using the right amount of force for each situation, compared with 46% of white Democrats who say this.

Hispanic Democrats are more positive in their evaluations of police performance in these domains than both white and Black Democrats; still, majorities rate police performance in these areas as only fair or poor.

Overall ratings of the police have declined since 2016

Americans’ ratings of police performance are lower than they were four years ago, and while substantial racial and partisan divides remain, these declines are largely seen among both white and Black adults.

The share of white Americans who say police are doing an excellent or good job of holding officers accountable for misconduct has fallen from half in 2016 to about one-third today (34%). The share of Black Americans who say this has also declined, from 21% to 12%.

The shares of white and Black adults who say police around the country are doing an excellent or good job of using the right amount of force have declined by identical amounts – 10 percentage points each – since 2016. The shares saying police are doing an excellent or good job of treating racial and ethnic groups equally have also declined by identical amounts (11 points each).

There has been no significant change since 2016 in the shares of white and Black Americans saying that police are doing an excellent or good job of protecting people from crime.

While overall public evaluations of police performance have become more negative since 2016, declines among Democrats have generally been steeper than among Republicans.

Republicans today are about as likely to say that police around the country do an excellent or good job of protecting people from crime as they were four years ago (78% today vs. 74% in 2016). Among Democrats, about four-in-ten (43%) say that police do an excellent or good job of protecting people, down from about half (53%) in 2016.

Republicans are only slightly less likely to say police do an excellent or good job of treating racial and ethnic groups equally or using the right amount of force for each situation than they were previously, but Democrats’ views on police performance in these areas have shifted downward more substantially. The share of Democrats who say police use appropriate force has decreased from 28% to 14%. And just one-in-ten Democrats now say that police do an excellent or good job of treating racial and ethnic groups equally, compared with about one-quarter (27%) who said this four years ago.

Republicans have changed the most in their views of police accountability. While nearly two-thirds (64%) said that police did an excellent or good job of holding officers accountable when misconduct occurs in 2016, only about half (51%) now say this. The share of Democrats who say police do an excellent or good job of holding officers accountable has decreased by a similar amount, from 27% to 13%.

Broad public support for several policing reform proposals

There is majority support among the public – and in both parties – for five policy proposals about policing included in the survey. However, there are still sizable partisan differences in these views.

Eight-in-ten or more Democrats either strongly or somewhat favor each of the five proposals, while there is more variation among Republicans. Even on policies where there is overwhelming bipartisan support – such as requiring police to be trained in nonviolent alternatives to deadly force, favored by nine-in-ten or more in both parties – Democrats are more likely than Republicans to strongly support such a policy (84% vs. 55%).

An overwhelming majority of Democrats (89%) say they favor giving civilian oversight boards power to investigate and discipline officers accused of misconduct, with 62% saying they strongly favor this. A narrower majority (58%) of Republicans say they either strongly or somewhat favor oversight boards (19% strongly favor). There is a similar pattern of opinion about making it a crime for police to use chokeholds or strangleholds (88% of Democrats and 57% of Republicans favor this).

Overwhelming majorities of both Republicans (85%) and Democrats (94%) favor creating a federal government database to track officers accused of misconduct. However, while about three-quarters of Democrats (77%) strongly favor this proposal, fewer than half of Republicans say the same (44%).

Large majorities of Republicans (91%) and Democrats (94%) also favor requiring police to be trained in nonviolent alternatives to deadly force. Among Democrats, 84% say they strongly favor this policy, while slightly more than half of Republicans (55%) say the same.

While majorities of white (71%), Black (82%) and Hispanic (81%) Americans favor giving civilian boards power to investigate and discipline officers, Black and Hispanic Americans are more likely than white Americans to favor this – and to do so strongly.

Nearly nine-in-ten Black adults (87%) favor making it a crime for police to use chokeholds or strangleholds, including 74% who do so strongly. This proposed policy is supported by 71% of white adults and 75% of Hispanic adults.

Seven-in-ten or more white (74%), Black (79%) and Hispanic (72%) adults say they favor requiring officers to live in the places they police, with Black Americans somewhat more likely than Hispanic and white Americans to strongly favor this.

And while the creation of a federal government database to track officers accused of misconduct is supported by wide majorities across racial and ethnic groups, Black adults are more likely than white adults to strongly favor this proposal.

Overwhelming majorities across racial and ethnic groups say they favor requiring police to be trained in nonviolent alternatives to deadly force, with at least seven-in-ten saying they strongly favor this.

Just a quarter of the public says spending on police should be decreased

About four-in-ten Americans (42%) say spending on policing in their area should stay about the same, while 31% say it should be increased and 25% say it should be decreased.

Support for decreasing spending on policing is higher among younger adults, Black adults, and Democrats and Democratic leaners, though even in these groups fewer than half say spending should be decreased.

Adults under 30 are much more likely than others to say that police spending should be decreased: 45% of those ages 18 to 29 say this, while 28% of those 30 to 49 and only 15% of those 50 and older say the same. Those over the age of 50 are more likely than younger Americans to say spending should be increased (37% say this, compared with 29% of 30- to 49-year-olds and 22% of those under 30).

About four-in-ten Black adults (42%) say spending on police in their area should decrease, including 22% who say spending should be decreased a lot. One-third of Black adults say spending should stay the same, while 22% say it should be increased.

In contrast, about two-in-ten white adults (21%) and a similar share of Hispanic adults (24%) say police spending in their area should be decreased, while larger shares in both groups (33% and 37%, respectively) say spending should be increased.

Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, 41% say spending on the police should be decreased, while just 8% of Republicans say the same. By comparison, 45% of Republicans and just 19% of Democrats that spending on the police should be increased (46% of Republicans and 38% of Democrats say spending should stay the same).

Among Democrats there are sizable age and ideological differences on this question.

White and Black Democrats are nearly equally likely to say that spending should be decreased (43% and 42% respectively); Hispanic Democrats are somewhat less likely to say this (32%). And while 34% of Hispanic Democrats say funding should be increased, that compares with 23% of Black Democrats and just 14% of white Democrats.

Younger Democrats are far more likely to say that spending on the police should be decreased. Similar majorities of white (57%) and Black (53%) Democrats under the age of 50 say that spending should be decreased, with nearly a third saying it should be decreased a lot (30% and 32%, respectively). By comparison, only about three-in-ten white and Black Democrats ages 50 and older (28% and 29%, respectively) say police spending should be decreased.

Liberal Democrats are much more likely to say that police spending should be decreased than conservative and moderate Democrats (57% vs. 27%). Democrats who say they are “very” liberal are particularly likely to hold this view – 68% say funding for police should be decreased, compared with 52% among those who say they are liberal (but not very liberal).

Democrats and younger Republicans back ending qualified immunity

Among Republicans, there are sizable divides by age when it comes to whether civilians should be able to sue the police: 61% of Republicans ages 18 to 29 say civilians need to have the power to sue police officers in order to hold them accountable, compared with about half of those 30 to 64 (47%) and just 31% of those 65 and older.

While at least three-quarters of Democrats in all age groups say that civilians should be able to sue the police, younger Democrats are more likely to say this: 87% of Democrats ages 18 to 29 say civilians need the power to sue the police, while slightly fewer Democrats 65 and older say the same (79%).

Eight-in-ten or more white (84%), Black (89%) and Hispanic (82%) Democrats say that civilians should have the power to sue police. White Democrats are much more likely than white Republicans to say this (84% vs. 43%)."	right
kx3v19	libertarian	Big government is a bipartisan problem, and both major parties are fiscally irresponsible.	"Many Americans are very upset that President-elect Joe Biden will replace President Donald Trump. For most of them, it's not that they will miss Trump's unconventional and often unacceptable behavior. Instead, it's that they fear that the size and scope of government will grow so fast that it will permanently change the country they love.

And this fear has intensified with the defeat of two Republican senators in the Georgia runoffs, resulting in Democrats regaining control of the Senate.

At the margin, such a worry is justified. With 50 Democratic senators and control of both the House of Representatives and the White House, more policies that would have never seen the light of day when Republicans were in power, such as much more unwise COVID-19 relief, will potentially get through.

That said, the chief driver of government expansion doesn't come from the identities of the officeholders but, rather, the incentive structures within politics. Personalities and party affiliations matter less than people believe. If limited government is what you're after, neither political party is your friend, since government expands under both. What's more, the rate at which it expands depends less on which big spenders are in power than on whether we have divided government.

For evidence, consider President George W. Bush's presidency, when, for a time, Republicans controlled both the House and Senate. During that time, we saw the creation of a new department (Homeland Security) and of a new entitlement (Medicare Part D), and spending exploded. We didn't see any restraint during the two years when Republicans were fully in control under Trump, either. Further data confirm that unified government does not keep government restrained, even if the controlling party is supposedly the enemy of big government.

Divided government, on the other hand, encourages more restraint, no matter who is in power or who controls which branch of government. Divided government doesn't stop the government from growing; both parties are always happy to spend more money on defense, infrastructure, and education, just to name a few favorites. However, the Democrats tend to limit the Republicans' hunger for wars, and Republicans prevent the worst of Democrats' fantasies about foisting greater government control on the economy.

The same principles apply today. While the Democrats have the senate, their razor-thin majority will depend on all their members voting together, with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie. So, thankfully, the Democrats' most extreme ideas, such as the Green New Deal, are unlikely to be adopted. But with a larger majority in both the House and the Senate, it may be impossible to stop some extreme schemes.

There's also no reason to believe that the government would perform any better if Republicans were in power. In a marketplace, scarcity forces people to compete for resources. A pricing system, with the risk of losses combined with the goal of potential profit, provides powerful signals to guide people's decisions to sensibly buy, sell, invest, and save. By contrast, the incentives for good management in government are very weak, because politicians make decisions using other people's money. As a result, their exposure to the risk of a bad decision is limited, while there's rarely any reward for spending taxpayers' money wisely or providing a service more effectively or efficiently.

Furthermore, each individual voter bears a very small part of the costs of bad government decisions. Politicians can thus shower special interest groups with subsidies at our collective expense, grant costly tariff protection to politically powerful producers, and generally waste our money for their individual political advantage.

And boy, do they have an advantage to do just that. In politics, decisions aren't driven by the profit motive like they are in the marketplace. Instead, they're overwhelmingly driven by the desire to get reelected. Special interests can help with that. In fact, public choice economists have shown that government officials receive more benefits when they act on behalf of special interests than for the public good. This finding doesn't depend on who is in power. But it explains why both Republicans and Democrats are eager to subsidize Boeing through the U.S. Export-Import Bank, or farmers through the farm bill.

Elections do have consequences. But we'd be wise to remember that the consequences produced by the incentives inherently built in our political system will often trump the impact of who's seemingly in charge.

kgv0i7	libertarian	The Supreme Court might be finding its way to overturning 'qualified immunity'	"This month, the United States Supreme Court issued a remarkable opinion that could pave the way to repealing qualified immunity. That doctrine — which shields government workers from accountability when they violate the constitution — relies on the policy that government workers should rarely be subject to lawsuits for money damages. But in Tanzin v. Tanvir, a unanimous Supreme Court said that it is not its business to do policy. In addition, it held that damages are not only an appropriate remedy against government workers who violate the Constitution, but that “this exact remedy has coexisted with our constitutional system since the dawn of the Republic.”

The case involves a group of Muslim men who, following the dictates of their faith, refused to cooperate with the FBI and spy on their communities. In retaliation, FBI agents placed the men on the No Fly List, robbing them of the ability to travel to see family or for work. Muhammad Tanvir, for example, lost his job as a long-haul trucker because it required him to fly cross-country after finishing deliveries.

The Religious Freedom Restoration Act and 'appropriate relief'

In the civil right lawsuits filed against the FBI agents, Tanvir and others asked for damages for violations of their religious rights. Luckily, there was just the statute to use in these circumstances. In 1993, Congress passed The Religious Freedom of Restoration Act (“RFRA”), which provided that individuals whose religious rights were violated by federal agents could sue to “obtain any appropriate relief against a government.”

In response, the government argued that “appropriate relief” does not include money damages. Although damages are the most common relief in lawsuits between regular people, the government argued that its employees should be treated differently. To convince the Court to adopt this special treatment, the government offered a plethora of policy arguments, all amounting to the idea that simply working for the government makes people impervious to damages suits.

Story continues

Supreme Court on Nov. 2, 2020, in Washington, D.C.

In a unanimous opinion penned by Justice Thomas, the Court disagreed. And in doing so, it undermined one of the primary justifications supporting the doctrine of qualified immunity.

Reality check for Trump's fantasies: Judges aren't his pawns on election lawsuits.

The Supreme Court created qualified immunity in 1982 to shield White House aides in the Nixon administration from a constitutional lawsuit. As its main justification, the Court relied on something it was not supposed to — policy. According to the Court in 1982, the availability of money damages against government workers would lead to negative policy outcomes: people would not take government jobs, and if they did, they would be distracted or afraid to act. To avoid those expected (and since disproven) policy outcomes, the Court created qualified immunity, which effectively overrode the constitution, shielded government workers from liability, and left the victims of constitutional violations to bear the cost.

That’s how things stood until earlier this month.

This week's historic court decision

In a historic decision, the Supreme Court not only embraced damages as an appropriate and traditional remedy for violations of constitutional rights, but also rejected the government’s invitation to consider policy arguments in order to deny plaintiffs their day in court. Justice Thomas wrote for the unanimous Court that while there “may be policy reasons why Congress may wish to shield Government employees from personal liability ... there are no Constitutional reasons why we must do so in its stead ... Our task is simply to interpret the law as an ordinary person would.”

In other words, instead of hewing closely to its 1982 precedent that considered policy to justify the creation of qualified immunity, the Court looked deeper into its past and embraced this country’s first principles, such as that where there is a right, there must be a remedy and that while Congress could certainly consider policy, the job of the Court is to focus on the law, and its interpretation.

COVID and Supreme Court: To this Supreme Court, religious freedom trumps public health — even amid COVID-19 plague

Simply put: Congress does policy; the Supreme Court does law.

Muhammad Tanvir and the other men against whom the FBI retaliated can now return to the lower court for a shot at accountability, through a suit for money damages. Now that the Court has confirmed its job is to do law, not policy, the foundation for qualified immunity is gone. The Court has paved the way toward repealing that doctrine and restoring constitutional accountability. We hope it does.

2





Hyattsville, MD — Two cops in Maryland are being praised in the local media after responding to a call about a belligerent mentally ill man in a convenience store. Instead of escalating force and beating, arresting, or killing the mentally ill man, the officers showed compassion and resolved the situation without even using handcuffs. They have now set the bar for other cops across the country.

As TFTP has frequently pointed out, even cops who voluntarily attend Crisis Intervention Training (CIT), have shown that they are quick to the trigger when dealing with the mentally ill.

The overwhelming majority of time spent by police during training is devoted to shooting their weapons. Very little time is set aside for training in de-escalation tactics, and most departments receive zero training in dealing with the mentally ill.

The list of unarmed and often completely innocent mentally ill people killed by police is immense. TFTP archives are full of tragic stories in which police were called to help someone in a crisis and end up murdering them. People are killed even when they aren’t in a crisis and simply act differently like Elijah McClain, who was on his way home from buying groceries and was murdered by police because he was an introvert and wore a ski mask.

The Hyattsville police department is apparently attempting to change this paradigm and the reactions by Officers Edgar Andrickson-Franco and Mancini Gaskill while responding to a mentally ill man in a crisis, shows it may be working.

Saturday night, the department received a 911 call from an employee at a Sunco gas station in regard to an angry agitated man inside who refused to leave. We’ve reported on cases like this which often end up with the person in a crisis being beaten, arrested, of even killed. This time, however, it would end successfully — without violence or an arrest.

“When we first arrived, he appeared to be incoherent,” Andrickson-Franco said to NBC 4 Washington. “He wasn’t making much sense.”

“We engaged in conversation with him and we didn’t want to be too overbearing,” Gaskill said.

Instead of simply grabbing the man and forcing him to the ground or violently engaging him, Andrickson-Franco sat on the floor and treated the man like a human being.

Even when the man became aggressive and verbally abusive, the officers refused to react and continued to show compassion.

“Me reacting the way he was reacting wasn’t going to get us anywhere,” Andrickson-Franco said. “If anything, it would have worsened the situation.”

Sitting on the floor and engaging the man like a human being instead of a threat showed the man that the officers actually cared and wanted to help him. Imagine that.

“I let him know I was there to help him out,” Andrickson-Franco said.

According to the officers, the man then handed them his cellphone so they could call a relative to come pick him up. And, just like that, the officers’ compassion resolved a situation without force, arrests, or death.

“It feels really good to know that they were able to deescalate that situation,” said Hyattsville police spokesperson Adrienne Augustus, a manager of the program.

“Not everyday situation you have to arrest somebody, right?” said. “That’s not our job. Our job is to help.”

According to the department, this reaction by the two officers was part of their new pilot program called Mental Health and Wellness Program. It teaches officers how to react with de-escalation techniques when dealing with mentally ill individuals in a crisis instead of yelling and force.

If this example can be repeated by other officers responding to similar situations, the program should be adopted by departments across the country.

In the meantime, however, as TFTP has reported, Denver, Colorado is doing this without cops and began the Support Team Assistance Response (STAR) program, which sends a mental health professional and a paramedic to some 911 calls instead of cops. When we first reported on the program in October, their results were fantastic. Now, it seems that departments who continue the old way are doing a disservice to the mentally ill.

According to their latest data, STAR has responded to more than 2,500 calls to 911 in which police would have normally been sent out. The STAR team — armed only with experience and compassion — has never once called police to back them up and no one was ever arrested. These two Maryland officers have now shown the country that cops are capable of this as well.

h92zxo	libertarian	Hero BLM supporter carried white far-right protester whose life was in danger, as he declares 'it's not black v white, it is everyone versus racists'	"A hero Black Lives Matter (BLM) supporter has lifted the lid on the moment he carried a ‘far-right’ protester, whose life was in danger, to safety in the midst of clashes with anti-racism protesters in London.

Patrick Hutchinson drew the attention of a nation yesterday when an image of him lifting the bloodied white protester onto his shoulders amid violent clashes near Trafalgar Square went viral.

Peacemaker Patrick Hutchinson says all he wants is equality for us all

Patrick, a martial arts expert, said: It’s not black versus white, it’s everyone versus the racists.

His life was under threat so I just scooped him up on to my shoulders and started marching towards the police with him.

It was scary. But you don’t think about it at the time, you do what you’ve got to do.

Footage of the incident showed Patrick and four friends forming a protective ring around the stricken white man, thought to be a far-right protester.

Personal trainer Patrick Hutchinson (right) has taken to social media to claim he was the man who had helped the opposition protester, telling his thousands of followers ‘We saved a life today’

It is believed he became separated from his group and was attacked during scuffles near the Royal Festival Hall.

Patrick, a personal trainer from Wimbledon, told Channel 4 News it is vital that people step in to stop the violence.

He added – If the other three police officers that were standing around when George Floyd was murdered had thought about intervening and stopping their colleague from doing what he was doing, George would be alive today.

Far-right thugs have been accused of starting the violence by attacking police and “Black Lives Matter” supporters.

Pierre Noah, one of Patrick’s friends, said – It would have turned out really bad because someone’s life could have been taken.

And you know what would have happened straight away, Black boys have killed somebody, they’ve killed a white man.

Another member of the group, Chris Otokito, added: We saw it escalating. Myself, Jay, Lee and Pierre were trying to get around the guy to stop it happening.

Patrick picked him up and tried to do what we could to hand him back to the safest place he could go."	right

m5b1ix	libertarian	Incognito mode isn’t that incognito... Google must face $5B lawsuit over tracking private internet use, judge rules. Fuck Google. Lol	"Getty Images

Google failed to win dismissal of a lawsuit alleging it collects users' data on internet activity even when they browse in a browser's private incognito mode. The lawsuit, filed in June, alleges Google violates wiretapping and privacy laws by continuing to ""intercept, track, and collect communications"" even when people use Chrome's incognito mode and other private web browser modes.

A federal judge on Friday denied the tech giant's request for dismissal of the lawsuit, which seeks class action status.

""The court concludes that Google did not notify users that Google engages in the alleged data collection while the user is in private browsing mode,"" US District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, wrote in her ruling.

The ruling comes amid continuing scrutiny of tech giants such as Google and Facebook how much data companies have gathered from consumers. Google said last year it would phase out third-party cookies that track a person's individual browsing across websites and target ads to them based on their activity.

Now playing: Watch this: Google accused of tracking people in Incognito mode

The lawsuit, which seeks at least $5 billion from Google and its parent company, Alphabet, alleges the company surreptitiously collects data through Google Analytics, Google Ad Manager, website plug-ins and other applications, including mobile apps.

Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment but has earlier said it disputes the claims, adding that each time users open a new incognito tab, they are informed that websites might be able to collect information about their browsing activity during your session."	right

hbe5hy	sandersforpresident	Something special is happening in Kentucky. Charles Booker is changing hearts and minds, and the state Democratic party is changing with him.	"Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), who defeated an incumbent House Democrat in 2018, endorsed Booker on Wednesday. A handful of national progressive groups have made late endorsements: Indivisible and Democracy for America also endorsed his bid Wednesday, and MoveOn and the Working Families Party jumped on board earlier this week.

“If we're looking at a race that’s down to a couple dozen or a couple hundred votes, we think every vote will matter down the stretch,” said Lucy Solomon, the IE political director for Indivisible. They plan to send 45,000 direct mail pieces and 25,000 text messages encouraging voters and helping them manage the process of voting under guidelines set because of Covid-19.

“We really think every little bit that everyone can do will have an impact on this election, and we're seeing that up close,” Solomon said.

Indivisible's membership voted to endorse Booker — though a local group, Indivisible Kentucky, which represents Louisville, previously endorsed Mike Broihier, another candidate in the primary. Broihier's campaign sent out a release Wednesday with local members criticizing the national organization's decision to back Booker.

Much of the backing for Booker has come after he already began surging, which started as he joined protests against police brutality in his hometown of Louisville. But endorsements from Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez last week sent a shockwave into the race, and others began to follow.

McGrath, who has mostly kept her aim set on McConnell, has massively outspent Booker on TV and is likely known by most Democratic primary voters, including those outside the population centers in Louisville and Lexington. But the influx of support has helped Booker increase his presence on the airwaves and boost his name identification.

""I'm proud our campaign for real progress and justice is catching fire, and I know we're going to have all the support we need to win on Tuesday,"" Booker said in a statement.

There is a limit to the benefit of the late endorsements from progressive groups, as new fundraising can only increase his TV presence so much. There’s limited time left to organize on the ground, particularly since many voters have already mailed in absentee ballots. Some progressives have expressed frustration that there wasn’t investment much earlier behind Booker and other liberal candidates in Senate primaries across the map this year.

Still, he has some in-state boosters that were already helping his bid, including the state’s two largest newspapers, Matt Jones, a popular sports radio host, and nearly two-dozen of his colleagues in the state legislature. This week, he’s added endorsements from Alison Lundergan Grimes — who challenged McConnell in 2014 — and Greg Stumbo, a longtime Kentucky Democratic figure who has served as state attorney general and state House speaker.

McGrath, a Marine veteran who lost a House bid in 2018, which was her first run for office, does not have substantial in-state endorsements from legislators or others in the political class. More than a dozen local and national unions have backed her campaign, and she has endorsements from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, VoteVets, the gun control group Giffords, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand's group Off the Sidelines and a handful of others. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer expressed confidence in McGrath earlier this week, and she remains the frontrunner in the race

“We all have the same goal here, all of us who want to defeat Mitch McConnell,"" McGrath said in an interview with POLITICO last week. ""I don’t focus so much on endorsements. I focus on winning this primary and defeating McConnell, building a team that can defeat him because Kentucky deserves a better senator.""

Still, the race is substantially closer than most Democrats predicted even weeks ago. Evan Weber, the co-founder of the climate group Sunrise Movement, which endorsed Booker early in the race, said they view his candidacy as an opportunity to “change the debate about big, bold ideas like the Green New Deal.”

“We’re thrilled the progressive movement as a whole is now lining up behind Charles, because it proves to us that leaders like him are our future,” Weber said."	left

j06f9j	sandersforpresident	The typical full-time salary in America would be $102,000 if wages had kept up with growth — but the economy has failed 90% of workers	"A new report from the nonprofit Rand finds that the median salary would have been as high as $102,000 for a full-time employee if wages increased at the same pace as GDP.

The median income right now is half that, at $50,000. The average wage of 44% of workers before the pandemic was as low as $18,000, according to Brookings.

And as wage growth stalled for 90% of workers, the average incomes of the top one percent increased at a whopping 300% of the rate of economic growth.

""Unlike the growth patterns in the 1950s and 1960s, the majority of full-time workers did not share in the economic growth of the last forty years,"" the report's authors wrote.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The coronavirus pandemic has laid bare the US' stark income inequality, as wealthy Americans buy private tutoring and concierge COVID-19 testing while the rest of the population struggles to get by.

But the country's income inequality problem was one 45 years in the making. A new report from the nonprofit think tank Rand finds that wages for all Americans increased at around the same pace as the the economy from 1947 to 1974. But since 1975, the bottom 90% of earners saw wages increase at a fraction of the pace of the richest Americans — even as the economy continued to grow.

Without income inequality — or if wages continued to increase at the same rate as overall GDP, like they did in the '50s and '60s — the median salary would have between $92,000 to $102,000 for a full-time employee.

The median income right now is half that, at $50,000. The average wage of 44% of workers before the pandemic was just $18,000, per Brookings, and a typical worker can no longer afford to care for a family of four on a year's salary.

And as wage growth stalled for 90% of workers, the average incomes of the top one percent increased at a whopping 300% of the rate of economic growth.

This chart, based on figures from the report, shows the authors' estimates for how real income has changed over time for Americans across the income distribution. While wages at the bottom have barely grown, earnings at the top have skyrocketed over the last few decades:

""Unlike the growth patterns in the 1950s and 1960s, the majority of full-time workers did not share in the economic growth of the last forty years,"" mathematician Carter Price and economies Kathryn Edwards, the paper's authors, wrote. ""During this time period, only the very top of the income distribution saw growth that matched or outpaced the real per capita GDP rate of the same timeframe.""

How the coronavirus pandemic laid bare America's crippling income inequality problem

Americans are working harder than ever, and the country has the world's richest economy.

But most people are still broke.

Since the 1970s, hourly compensation has increased just 9.2%, while productivity, or the output of goods and services per hour worked, increased by 74.4% in the same time period. While a child born in 1945 had a 90% chance of making more than their parents, someone born in 1985 only has a 50% shot of faring better than them. It's easier to achieve the American Dream in China, South Africa, and Brazil than it is in the US.

Because of the country's high income inequality, Price and Edwards found that the bottom 90% of American workers lost out on $50 trillion in earnings since 1975 due to income inequality, or roughly $2.5 a year through 2020.

The repercussions of income inequality can be seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, as US billionaires got $637 billion richer since March, while states received over 60 million unemployment claims in the same time period. MIT found that most of the jobs destroyed by the pandemic have been low-wage service sector gigs — roles that also can't easily social distance and have been more susceptible to the disease. After talk of a ""V"" or ""U""-shaped recession , a ""K""-shaped recession is emerging instead, one accentuated by inequality.

High-paying jobs have not only rebounded, but those workers have also been relatively safer, as they are at lower risk of contracting the virus due to a greater ability to work from home."	left

Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), has already achieved significant progress in the century-old struggle for universal healthcare in the United States of America, including reaching a historic majority of House Democrats as co-sponsors of the bill and historic first-ever Congressional hearings on Medicare For All held in December 2019.

Twenty-nine Californian House Democrats are Co-sponsors to the bill, including Rep. Barbara Lee, Rep. Ro Khanna, Rep. Karen Bass, and Rep. Maxine Waters.

An Edison Research/Washington Post statewide exit poll of California voters on March 3rd, 2020 found that 55% of voters supported replacing all private health insurance with a single-payer government plan for everyone. Only 36% opposed.

“Medicare For All is the single most life-saving piece of legislation that Congress could adopt. COVID-19 threatens us all, but not equally,” said Dr. Hae Min Cho, a San Francisco Delegate. “Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders are dying at 4 times the general rate. Our Black brothers and sisters are dying at 2.4 times the general rate. Young Latinx folks have the highest rates of exposure in CA. Homeless neighbors, incarcerated folks, and migrants in ICE detention facilities are in much greater danger. Trans people, the elderly and poor desperately need coverage. We all need Medicare For All, now more than ever.”

Follow Bernie's lead and always remained focused on the issues that matter to working people.	"US gross domestic product fell at a record 33% annualized rate in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said on Thursday.

Economists had forecast a 35% GDP contraction, reflecting the months when many US states were locked down to contain the spread of the coronavirus.

While activity picked up again in May and June as states started to reopen, it wasn't enough to undo the damage of the lockdowns.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

It's official: The coronavirus pandemic has led to the worst GDP slump in American history.

US gross domestic product fell at an annualized rate of 33% in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. It's the largest fall on record dating back to the 1940s. Economists had expected a roughly 35% annualized drop, according to Bloomberg data.

The historic drop in output reflected the worst months of pandemic-related shutdowns to control the spread of COVID-19 and followed a 4.8% contraction in the first quarter that ended the longest expansion in US history.

In April, much of the country was operating under strict stay-at-home orders that brought much activity to a halt. While activity picked up again in May and June as states started to reopen, it wasn't enough to undo the damage of the lockdowns.

""The decline in second quarter GDP reflected the response to COVID-19, as 'stay-at-home' orders issued in March and April were partially lifted in some areas of the country in May and June, and government pandemic assistance payments were distributed to households and businesses,"" the Bureau of Economic Analysis report said.

The US is now grappling with spikes in COVID-19 cases that have threatened to derail the economic recovery from the pandemic recession. Many states have had to pause or roll back reopening plans to deal with new coronavirus cases, weighing on economic activity. Unemployment remains high, and consumer sentiment has slumped.

While stark, the historic GDP figures may appear worse than they are, because they are reported as an annualized rate. The forecast GDP drop of 35% on an annualized basis actually means the economy was about 10% smaller in the second quarter than in the first months of the year.

Still, the economy shrinking by 10% in one quarter is also a record slump. And Thursday's figure is the first of three estimates, meaning it could be revised to reflect an even sharper contraction.

Economists expect that economic activity has picked up as states have reopened; those surveyed by Bloomberg expect that the economy will grow at an 18% annualized rate in the third quarter. Even though that would be a record positive jump, it would still leave GDP far below pre-pandemic levels.

gidp2v	sandersforpresident	Dr. Fauci Tells Bernie Sanders Number of Coronavirus Deaths ‘Almost Certainly Higher’ Than Being Reported	"Infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci told a Senate committee that the number of deaths from the coronavirus is “almost certainly higher” than the approximately 80,000 that have been counted in the official death toll.

Dr. Fauci and other Trump administration officials testified at a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing entitled “COVID-19: Safely Getting Back to Work and Back to School,” where Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders asked about the official death toll.

“The official statistic, Dr Fauci, is that 80,000 Americans have died from the pandemic,” Sanders said, and added “There are some epidemiologists who suggest the number maybe 50% higher than that. What do you think?”

“I’m not sure, Senator Sanders, if it’s going to be 50% higher, but most of us feel that the number of deaths are likely higher than that number,” Fauci said, “because given the situation, particularly in New York City, when they were really strapped with a very serious challenge to their healthcare system, that there may have been people who died at home who did have Covid, who were not counted as Covid because they never really got to the hospital.”

“So the direct answered to your question, I think you are correct, that the number is likely higher. I don’t know exactly what percent higher, but almost certainly it’s higher,” Fauci said.

Fauci’s response contradicts what President Donald Trump has reportedly said in private, which is that the official death toll is “inflated,” but consistent with multiple analyses of excess deaths during the pandemic.

Last Thursday, the Senate departed the nation's capital for a two-week recess without taking any action on Covid-19 relief—even amid dire warnings that millions of additional workers could lose their jobs if Congress doesn't urgently approve aid to state and local governments.

The Senate is not expected to return to session until July 20, just 11 days before the $600 weekly boost in unemployment benefits is set to expire.

""Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has focused on other issues in recent weeks, such as an annual defense policy bill and confirming President Trump's nominees,"" the Washington Post reported Monday. ""When the Senate comes back into session July 20, McConnell plans to turn his attention back to the coronavirus, giving lawmakers just three weeks to negotiate and pass a big rescue bill before they adjourn again through Labor Day.""

McConnell said last week that he has no intention of delaying the August 10 recess.

Sanders condemned the Senate for dragging its feet ""in the midst of these unprecedented crises"" and noted that the pandemic has been made worse by ""a president who thinks the coronavirus will just 'disappear' and that he has a 'natural ability' to understand this deadly virus.""

""It will not, and he does not,"" the Vermont senator said. ""People are dying every day because of his lies and incompetence.""

Upon its return, Sanders wrote, the Senate must approve sweeping Covid-19 stimulus legislation that:

Uses federal funds to cover workers' paychecks and prevent more layoffs;

Extends the $600-per-week boost in unemployment benefits;

Expands Medicare to cover the uninsured;

Provides emergency funding to prevent the collapse of the U.S. Postal Service;

Sends a $2,000 monthly check to every working-class person in the U.S. until the end of the pandemic;

Cancels rent and mortgage payments until the end of the pandemic;

Increases federal nutrition benefits; and

Requires the federal government to manufacture and distribute free face masks to everyone in the U.S.

The Vermont senator urged his supporters to sign a petition pressuring the Senate to ""act and pass legislation to protect the health and economic well-being of the American people.""

""These are ideas that the American people support, and it is time that the do-nothing Senate implement them,"" Sanders wrote. ""But this I know: nothing will happen unless the American people stand up, fight back, and demand, in overwhelming numbers, that the Senate act."""	left

hm91fr	sandersforpresident	Court orders Dakota crude pipeline shutdown, in win for Native American tribes in long-running saga	"The US Army Corps of Engineers on Sunday announced they will no longer allow the Dakota Access Pipeline to cross under the Missouri river crossing on the Standing Rock reservation in North Dakota, marking a huge win for Native Americans and protesters who had long opposed the construction.

A federal court ruled Monday that the Dakota Access Pipeline must shut down within 30 days, by Aug. 5, according to a copy of the brief obtained by USA Today.

The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia scrapped a key permit from the Army Corps of Engineers, and ordered the pipeline to end its three-year run of delivering oil out of North Dakota's Bakken shale basin to its endpoint in Illinois. The decision marked the end of a yearslong legal battle over the Energy Transfer Partners-owned pipeline's environmental damage to the Missouri River.

President Donald Trump granted the permit in 2017 over the objections of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and environmental activists, arguing oil spills could contaminate their water source and put their culture at risk.

The court ruled the pipeline be shut down pending a full environmental review ordered previously.

""The Corps had failed to produce an Environmental Impact Statement despite conditions that triggered such a requirement,"" the court ruling said. ""Although mindful of the disruption such a shutdown will cause, the Court now concludes that the answer is yes.""

""Given the seriousness of the Corps' NEPA error, the impossibility of a simple fix, the fact that Dakota Access did assume much of its economic risk knowingly, and the potential harm each day the pipeline operates, the Court is forced to conclude that the flow of oil must cease,"" the ruling said.

A spokesperson at Energy Transfer Partners told CNBC the pipeline is ""the safest, most environmentally responsible method for moving North Dakota's crude oil to refining markets around the country.""

""Shutting down this critical piece of infrastructure would throw our country's crude supply system out of balance, negatively impact several significant industries, inflict more damage on an already struggling economy, and jeopardize our national security,"" the spokesperson said. ""This was an ill-thought-out decision by the Court that should be quickly remedied.""

Was the turnaround out of true conviction on his part, or was it pure opportunism that he needed the backing of the “Progressive” (a/k/a Socialists) left in order to fulfill his lifelong desire to be president? I wonder how many voters who voted for Sleepy Joe thought they we getting the “moderate” Joe instead of a leaping lefty as the clone of socialist Bernie Sanders?	left
lv9gpj	sandersforpresident	House Dems Demand Harris Advance $15 Minimum Wage	"In a new letter, nearly two dozen House Dems are pressing Vice President Kamala Harris to ignore the Senate parliamentarian and fulfill her minimum wage promise.

Photo credit: Saul Loeb/Getty Images

This report was written by Julia Rock and Andrew Perez.

Progressive House lawmakers are demanding Vice President Kamala Harris use her power as presiding officer of the Senate to immediately advance the $15 minimum wage that she has long said she supports.

“Eighty-one million people cast their ballots to elect you on a platform that called for a $15 minimum wage. We urge you to keep that promise,” the lawmakers wrote in a letter to Harris and President Joe Biden, pressing the White House to raise the wage for workers as part of Biden’s American Rescue Plan. “We must act now to prevent tens of millions of hardworking Americans from being underpaid any longer.”

The letter released Monday was signed by 23 Democrats, including Reps. Ro Khanna, Pramila Jayapal, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, Jamal Bowman, and Cori Bush.

Raising the federal minimum wage from its current level of $7.25 an hour to $15 an hour would increase the wages of 32 million workers, a majority of whom currently live below the poverty line.

“We believe that the bill the President signs must include the House-passed minimum wage legislation,” Khanna told The Daily Poster. “This is the moment to get this done and it is within our control.”

The Senate Presiding Officer Is The Decider, Not The Parliamentarian

Last Thursday, Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough, the body’s nonpartisan adviser on all procedural matters, issued an opinion advising Democrats that she believes the minimum wage increase is subject to a point of order, allowing it to be stripped out of a COVID bill under the budget reconciliation process. Democrats are using that process so they can pass the legislation by a simple majority vote.

The parliamentarian’s advice is non-binding. The presiding officer of the Senate is the ultimate decision maker and can ignore the parliamentarian, as The Daily Poster previously reported and as indicated by a recent Congressional Research Service (CRS) report. If the minimum wage is included in Democrats’ COVID relief bill and Republicans raise a point of order to try to strip it out, the presiding officer can reject the point of order.

As vice president, Harris is the chamber’s presiding officer, though if she decides to avoid being present in the chamber, another Democratic senator can issue rulings on parliamentary questions. The CRS report notes that 60 votes are needed to overrule a presiding officer’s ruling, though Republican senators could try to change that longstanding rule with a simple majority vote.

Democrats also have another option to advance the minimum wage: They could follow Republican precedent and replace the parliamentarian with a different adviser with a different interpretation of the so-called Byrd Rule, a three-decade-old rule requiring measures in budget legislation be related to federal spending. A Congressional Budget Office report said the minimum wage is related to spending, but the parliamentarian ignored that report.

While Democratic Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin backed a minimum wage increase in 2014, they have said they oppose including a $15 minimum wage in the COVID bill. It’s unclear whether they would vote to sink the entire relief package if Democrats include the measure and overrule the parliamentarian.

White House Is So Far Trying To Preemptively Surrender

President Biden campaigned on a promise to enact a $15 minimum wage and presented himself as the guy who knows “how to make government work,” but his White House has suggested it wants Democratic senators to accept the parliamentarian’s opinion and allow the minimum wage measure to be pulled out of the COVID relief bill.

“The vice president's not going to weigh in,” Biden National Economic Council Director Brian Deese said Friday on CNBC. “The president and the vice president both respect the parliamentarian's decision and the process.”

House Democrats included the minimum wage measure in the COVID relief legislation they passed on Saturday.

The new letter from the House Democrats heightens the pressure on Harris, who has backed a $15 minimum wage for years.

Exactly one year ago today, Harris reiterated her support for the wage increase.

She is now letting White House aides speak for her on the issue, however. Harris, should she want to run for president, could be seen as the candidate who killed a major party priority while in the White House. Alternately, she could play a high-profile role in advancing the minimum wage increase.

The letter notes that Vice President Hubert Humphrey twice overruled the Senate parliamentarian, as did Vice President Walter Mondale. In 2001, Republicans fired the parliamentarian after he made two rulings that impeded their policy goals.

Days before the presidential election, Harris appeared in a virtual town hall with Sen. Bernie Sanders and committed to raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Biden and Harris both backed a $15 minimum wage during the Democratic primaries.

“The outdated and complex Byrd rule, rooted in restricting progress, must not be an impediment to improving people’s lives.” the House Democrats said in their letter. “You have the authority to deliver a raise for millions of Americans.”

hu2565	sandersforpresident	AOC’s Anti-Billionaire Crusaders Are Taking Over New York City	"(Bloomberg) -- The protest began at Madison Square Park, where Jeff Bezos spent $96 million creating his Manhattan dream home.

From there, the small group marched to the Midtown offices of Governor Andrew Cuomo with a demand that has begun to grow louder as the pandemic grinds on: soak the super-rich.

Friday’s demonstration in New York, and others like it, haven’t reached anything near the level of the Occupy Wall Street movement a decade ago. But this time, protesters have a hometown advocate in Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive lawmaker who this week joined a campaign demanding Cuomo pass a billionaires’ tax for New York State.

“They take and take and take from our city and do not contribute, proportionally,” said Molly Glenn, 34, who works in construction and joined Friday’s protest. “You want to have an apartment here. You want to say that you are a member of the greatest city in the country. You should have to support the city.”

There are about 100 people tracked by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index whose primary residence is New York state. Their wealth often comes from finance -- names such as Steve Schwarzman, Jim Simons and Leon Black. But vast New York fortunes have also been made in real estate, media and industry. The majority have multiple homes and there’s no guarantee they’ll stick around if a wealth tax is enacted.

Carl Icahn, born in the Far Rockaway neighborhood in Queens, New York City, has been an icon on Wall Street for decades and is worth $18.3 billion. He said in September that he planned to relocate his home and business to Florida to avoid paying New York’s higher taxes.

That was before Ocasio-Cortez backed the bill -- sponsored by state senator Jessica Ramos -- that aims to tax unrealized gains on billionaires’ wealth to create an emergency worker bailout fund for poor and undocumented New Yorkers. The bill will be considered after the state legislature returns Monday.

“It’s time to stop protecting billionaires, and it’s time to start working for working families,” Ocasio-Cortez, who represents parts of the Bronx and Queens, said in a video directed at Cuomo. The message spread on Twitter with the hashtag #MakeBillionairesPay.

AOC has campaigned for higher taxes on the rich since bursting on the scene in 2018. Targeting the state level is a new twist. And her supporters and influence within New York’s Democratic Party is growing. Jamaal Bowman, who’s also bashed Bezos, just beat long-term Representative Eliot Engel in a Democratic primary.

Cuomo has previously opposed raising taxes on the wealthy, but the drumbeat is growing, partly fueled by the coronavirus’s impact on the city. He repeated to reporters on Thursday his opposition to a tax that could drive the wealthy away.

Priorities Changing

Michael Novogratz, a Democrat who made his fortune in hedge funds, also warned that the tax-driven approach will be counterproductive.

“Wealthy people are willing to pay more tax, though it has to be fair,” said Novogratz, who now invests in digital currencies and in recent weeks has been a vocal supporter of Black Lives Matter. “The biggest problem with the tax code is some groups pay and other don’t.”

The danger, Novogratz says, is that those who already pay a substantial share of New York taxes will move to lower-tax states, especially as the pandemic changes priorities.

There was already momentum toward leaving New York after the 2017 Republican tax overhaul created a $10,000 limit for state and local tax deductions, which hurt property owners. Covid-19, which makes lower-density living more attractive, is pushing hordes of others out, he added.

That’s a view shared by Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University.

“No one knows in this climate how people are making location decisions,” Moss said. “We want to do everything possible to maintain people in New York rather than to encourage them to move to low-density or low-tax locations.”

hh0rmj	sandersforpresident	'Not On Our Watch': AOC, In Powerful Floor Speech, Declares House Democrats Will Protect Civil Rights Law From Trump	"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Friday evening delivered an impassioned speech defending a longstanding civil rights law which combats the racist practice of redlining that is under attack by the White House.

""Over the last several weeks, our nation has been gripped by the uprising against anti-black racism and systemic racial injustice across the United States,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""But there is a difference between saying that we believe in the inherent dignity, equality and value of our black brothers and sisters and actually committing to it. And the Community Reinvestment Act is one such commitment.""

If you don’t know what the Community Reinvestment Act is and why we need to protect it, listen to @AOC. Then tell your representative to support #HJRes90. Here’s @civilrightsorg’s letter explaining its importance: https://t.co/ssXN97YXUD pic.twitter.com/ZbXLpmoApp — Vanita Gupta (@vanitaguptaCR) June 26, 2020

Ocasio-Cortez was speaking in favor of a resolution brought to the floor by Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) condemning attacks on the CRA. The law, enacted in 1977, requires banks to do business with homeowners in lower-income neighborhoods, thereby reducing the frequency of redlining.

Long a thorn in the side of banking interests in the country, the law has been quietly under attack by President Donald Trump's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which has weakened regulations set by the act.

In an open letter urging lawmakers to support the CRA, a coalition of groups led by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights emphasized the role of housing in the protection of Black lives.

According to the letter:

It is clear that the CRA needs to be modernized and strengthened in order to fulfill its original purpose. But in January, the OCC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that would instead significantly weaken the CRA. The agencies proposed new overly simplistic metrics system that would make it far easier for banks to pass their CRA exams by making large investments in communities where they can reap the largest rewards, rather than carefully-targeted, smaller investments in underserved consumers and neighborhoods.

In her remarks, Ocasio-Cortez noted the disconnect between GOP public declarations of sympathy and support for victims of racism and police brutality—seen in widely criticized Republican-led legislation purportedly aimed at police reform—and the real world effects of the party's policy priorities.

""While this administration and the Republican Party paid lip service to Black and brown communities with toothless policing legislation, behind everyone's back the OCC made moves to gut rules around CRA and advance the continued economic oppression of Black people in the United States,"" said Ocasio-Cortez. ""In fact, these rule changes advance gentrification and value luxury housing over investment in Black lives."""	left

hyshld	sandersforpresident	360 Democratic delegates refuse to vote for party platform unless it includes Medicare For All. Delegates are calling on the Democratic Party to join the rest of the developed world and finally support single payer healthcare.	"A revolt is brewing among Bernie Sanders delegates three weeks from the Democratic National Convention.

More than 360 delegates, most of whom back Sanders, have signed on to a pledge to vote against the Democratic Party’s platform if it does not include support for ""Medicare for All,"" the petition’s organizers told POLITICO. They argue that single-payer health care is an urgent priority amid a worldwide pandemic and the biggest unemployment crisis since the Great Depression.

“This pandemic has shown us that our private health insurance system does not work for the American people. Millions of people have lost their jobs and their health care at the same time,” said Judith Whitmer, a Sanders delegate and chair of the convention’s Nevada delegation who helped spearhead the pledge. “There’s people leaving the hospital now with millions of dollars in medical bills. What are we going to do about that?”

The warning is all but certain to set up a clash between Sanders’ most dedicated supporters and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, who opposes Medicare for All, at a time when the party is seeking to demonstrate unity ahead of its August convention. Though the petition signers have little chance of revising the platform to include Medicare for All support, they do have the numbers to draw attention to their protest and cause.

It is also likely to trigger fears among Democratic leaders about a repeat of the 2016 convention, when the party’s divides were on public display as Sanders supporters booed the mention of Hillary Clinton.

The left-wing groups Progressive Democrats of America and RootsAction.org are announcing Monday that they support the vow to vote against the platform if it doesn’t include Medicare for All. The Bernie Delegates Network, a coalition made up of hundreds of Sanders delegates, said it will also publicize the petition. Organizers expect those efforts will net hundreds more signatures, including from Biden delegates.

“The sea change that’s underway could swell as a result of this initiative,” said Norman Solomon, national director of RootsAction.org and a Sanders delegate. “It’s a reasonable hope that historians will look back at the next couple of weeks as a time when hundreds of delegates stepped forward and said, ‘This is a red line for a humane society and we’re not going to stop saying so.’”

Biden currently has 2,632 delegates, while Sanders has 1,076, according to POLITICO's delegate tracker.

Despite their frustration with Biden, progressive leaders behind the pledge all said they are voting for Biden and working to elect him. RootsAction.org, for instance, noted that it is planning to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on an effort to persuade swing-state progressives who are on the fence to get behind Biden.

Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden.

Organizers also said they are not being divisive — rather, it’s the party leaders who are overruling the grassroots who are being divisive, they argued. They point to exit polls showing that majorities of Democratic primary voters across states are in favor of Medicare for All.

""We're going to fight like hell for Biden. And there's no contradiction between doing that and supporting this pledge,"" Solomon said.

Whitmer said Sanders delegates in Nevada began circulating the pledge on Thursday through Slack and delegate groups. Though she did not provide precise numbers, she said it is safe to say that a majority who signed on are Sanders delegates, though some Biden delegates have as well. Activists hope a significant number of Biden delegates will support the vow.

The announcement of the pledge comes as President Donald Trump is attempting to paint Biden as a “puppet of the radical left.” His campaign has spent at least $14 million on a misleading ad claiming that police would be defunded under a Biden administration. The former vice president came out against defunding police almost as soon as it gained prominence.

Last week, a DNC committee released a draft platform that did not include support for Medicare for All or other top progressive priorities such as a jobs guarantee or the ""Green New Deal,"" despite Sanders aides’ efforts to include them as planks. Organizers are going public with the Medicare for All pledge now in part because they hope to influence the Democratic National Committee’s platform committee, which is taking up the agenda on Monday. Whitmer said activists successfully persuaded a member of the panel to submit an amendment to back single-payer.

The pledge by delegates to vote against a platform without Medicare for All represents something of a split over strategy between Sanders and his most passionate supporters. After moderates accused him of failing to do everything he could to persuade his supporters to back Clinton in 2016 — a charge he vehemently denied — the Vermont senator has taken multiple steps to bring the Democratic Party together this cycle.

Sanders set up “unity” task forces with Biden, which released recommendations earlier this month. Progressives successfully pushed Biden’s allies to move left on certain issues, such as climate change, immigration and a no-deductible public option for health care. But they failed to persuade moderates on the task forces to back legalizing marijuana, end ""qualified immunity,"" or embrace single-payer.

Sanders aides again tried to push centrists on the DNC’s draft committee to get behind Medicare for All, but failed to do so. However, they did manage to insert a nod to single-payer in the platform.

“Generations of Democrats have been united in the fight for universal health care. We are proud our party welcomes advocates who want to build on and strengthen the Affordable Care Act and those who support a Medicare for All approach; all are critical to ensuring that health care is a human right,” the draft states.

But some progressive activists were unimpressed, pointing to the more than 5 million people that liberal advocacy group Families USA said have lost their health insurance between February and May because of the coronavirus.

“Democrats who understand the profound need for Medicare for All don’t want a pat on the head,” Solomon said. “We want a genuine political commitment to health care as a human right. Biden hasn’t gotten there.”

Solomon and others said they have a different role than Sanders and the task forces, and vice versa.

In a Zoom call with his delegates last week, Sanders said of the task forces, “Did we get everything we wanted? Obviously we didn’t. That's for sure. But I think we reached agreements on all, in all of these areas.""

He also urged his supporters to both “engage in coalition politics with the goal of defeating Trump,” and to ""make sure that a Biden administration is the most progressive administration in modern American history.""

Whitmer said she wants to make the party platform a more bottom-up process.

“In the Democratic Party, there’s an attitude that we have to write our platform to match the candidate and the candidate’s position,” she said. “We want to get back to the way it should be, which is the people create the platform based on our values and principles, and what we want the candidate to support.”"	left
kzwro9	sandersforpresident	Bernie Sanders Is About to Become the Chair of the Senate Budget Committee	"The long-held Republican nightmare that a champion of working-class people and the common good — one who has dedicated his political career to curbing poverty and injustice while denouncing corporate greed, endless war, and the cruelty of a for-profit health system that leaves millions upon millions uninsured or without affordable access to care — would assume the powerful position of chairing the Senate Budget Committee is about to become reality.

“Time to face the harsh reality, socialist Bernie Sanders will become the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. He has vowed to use his position to enact his progressive agenda on healthcare, climate, infrastructure spending, and cutting defense spending,” Nikki Haley tweeted Saturday.

While it came from Trump’s former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations as a kind of ominous warning, Sanders’ wife, Jane O’Meara Sanders, was among those who shot back with a clever and simple quip. “Yes he has,” she tweeted in response.

Not that Jane Sanders was alone:

Imagine being horrified by the prospect of spending more money on things that make life better for people everywhere and less on things designed to kill people outside the U.S. . . . https://t.co/gycEQYH0al — Sandeep Vaheesan (@sandeepvaheesan) January 17, 2021

“You forgot to mention raising the minimum wage and taxing your rich friends,” the organizing group People for Bernie tweeted back at Haley.

Republican fears of Sanders taking over the committee go back to at least 2016 when Congressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, then Speaker of the GOP-controlled House, said ahead of that year’s election: “If we lose the Senate, do you know who becomes chair of the Senate Budget Committee? A guy named Bernie Sanders. You ever heard of him?”

We are lucky to be alive to see Paul Ryan's worst nightmare come truehttps://t.co/Uj1axyzdI5 — Olivia Becker (@oliviaLbecker) January 12, 2021

The GOP trepidation over such a reality is about to materialize now that Democrats have seized razor-thin majority control of the Senate. And, while the gavel is yet to be placed in his hand, Sanders and his staff have signaled in recent days that he will be ready and willing to wield it to push the incoming Biden administration — as well as Democratic leadership in the House and Senate — to enact the kind of bold, working-class friendly policies that fueled both of his presidential runs.

Among the chief powers that the chair of the committee will be able to utilize is fostering legislation through the Senate using the budget reconciliation process — a procedural tool that will allow, even under current rules, legislation to pass with a simple majority.

“Yes, we can and we must use budget reconciliation to increase the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour with a simple majority vote in the Senate, just like Republicans did to pass massive tax breaks to the 1%,” declared Warren Gunnels, one of Sanders’ most senior aides who went out of the way to identify himself as the “Incoming Majority Staff Director” for the “Senate Budget Committee” in a tweet Friday morning.

Following the Democratic wins in Georgia that gave the party back the majority in the Senate, Sanders told Politico in an interview that he has no plans to be sheepish from his perch atop the committee.

“I’m going to use reconciliation in as aggressive a way as I possibly can to address the terrible health and economic crises facing working people today,” Sanders told the news outlet. “As we speak, my staff and I are working. We’re working with Biden’s people. We’re working with Democratic leadership. We’ll be working with my colleagues in the House to figure out how we can come up with the most aggressive reconciliation bill to address the suffering of the American working families today.”

Nina Turner, national co-chair of Sanders’ 2020 campaign and now running for U.S. House in her home state of Ohio, has been among those in the progressive movement championing the legislative potential of his powerful new roll in the Senate:

Go Big, Mr. Chairman. We have a moral imperative. Hello Somebody🙌🏾https://t.co/7np4HnUuDE — Nina Turner (@ninaturner) January 12, 2021

In a tweet on Saturday evening, Sanders himself stated: “When Republicans controlled the Senate they used the reconciliation process to provide huge tax breaks for the rich and large corporations. We’re going to use reconciliation to protect working families, the sick and the poor.”

ldiouv	sandersforpresident	Perhaps We Should Regulate Deranged Billionaires Like Elon Musk	"Last month, Elon Musk officially became the world’s richest man. Though it sounds like the plot of a decidedly down-market Bond flick, he’s now also the world’s most powerful space baron.

That’s according to a new analysis, which finds that the SpaceX CEO now controls more than 27 percent of all active satellites currently orbiting Earth — roughly one thousand out of 3,500. Musk’s stake is almost certain to get even bigger in the coming years, with physicist Alastair Isaacs estimating the share could grow to 50 percent as early as 2022 based on the number of launches currently associated with SpaceX. The greatest proportion of those launches are related to Starlink — an initiative the company says will bring “near global” high-speed internet coverage this year.

Given Musk’s well-established penchant for absurd and often cringeworthy self-promotion, this claim can probably be taken with a grain of salt. Just a few short years ago, after all, the billionaire was confidently telling a technology conference that he would begin sending rockets to Mars in 2018 and would be able to start colonization efforts within a decade. Pure hokum, as it usually turns out to be, Musk’s techno-utopian hype has nevertheless given him an image more like that of a Promethean creator than a garden-variety capitalist — more vanguard of humanity’s interstellar future than telecom monopolist in its present.

Whether SpaceX is ultimately capable of sending people to Mars or not, even a cursory glance at Musk’s vision for space travel is a warning about the dangers of allowing billionaires to extend their grip beyond the atmosphere. Last year, the company published updated terms of service for its Starlink project, announcing that it would not recognize international law on the Red Planet. Instead, Musk envisions a kind of off-world Randianism in which “self-governing principles” (i.e., those determined by his company) form the rules of the road. Though his stated blueprint for Martian colonization looks like a textbook case of obvious nonsense (involving, among other things, some truly absurd math) we should, at any rate, read this as a genuine statement of intent. If a new life ever actually does await in the off-world colonies, prospective space monopolists are determined to shape it themselves, free of constraint. Given how companies like Tesla already treat their workers, it takes little imagination to picture what that might look like.

In fact, what Musk himself envisioned during a Twitter Q&A last summer was more or less explicitly a kind of space feudalism. As Gizmodo’s Tom McKay observed at the time, even the idealized Martian future of the billionaire’s social media PR imagined putting hypothetical interstellar pilgrims to work for SpaceX upon their arrival:

Oh, and anyone who wishes to go along for the ride will have to pay for it, despite the fact that Mars would arguably be SpaceX’s job site. Can’t afford it? Take out a loan and pay it off by working for SpaceX when you’re there, which is definitely not indentured servitude because . . . Mars? Because it happens on Mars. That appears to be the logic.

For the time being, at least, Musk remains just a regular, exorbitantly rich corporate oligarch with a uniquely cringeworthy social media presence. But even if his vision of becoming Martian god-emperor never comes to fruition, the billionaire is already on course to control a vital piece of global infrastructure in the decades ahead. Just as the robber barons of the Gilded Age monopolized railways, steel, oil, and other commodities, those of the twentyi-first century now largely own the internet, the digital public square, and other crucial architecture of modern social, cultural, and economic life.

The world’s richest man now controls nearly 30 percent of earth’s satellites: What could possibly go wrong?

ksi0c4	sandersforpresident	After Their Victories in Georgia, the Democrats Have No More Excuses	"No single factor is usually the lone cause of a particular electoral outcome — and, in the case of Tuesday’s Senate runoffs in Georgia, there were undoubtedly many different ones at play: the looming end of the Trump administration and the intraparty war over whether to accept November’s defeat, the widespread hardship wrought by the ongoing pandemic, the candidates themselves, the perceived stakes involved. Indeed, on Tuesday night, a perfect confluence of factors appears to have carried candidates Raphael Warnock (who will be the first ever black senator from Georgia) and Jon Ossoff over the top in two hotly contested races set to give Democrats control of the Senate in addition to the House and presidency.

Near top on the list has to be the sheer disarray of the Republican Party, whose chosen tribunes were among the wealthiest people in Congress and both dogged by well-justified allegations of insider trading. Compounding the uniquely unappealing duo of candidates David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, there seems to have been genuine confusion in parts of the GOP base about whether to vote at all — with some Trump supporters suggesting a boycott. (Photos of Loeffler alongside a former member of the Ku Klux Klan can’t have helped a great deal.) Democrats, meanwhile, were able to present a comparatively united front and drive voters to the polls in high numbers, with turnout from black Georgians proving particularly decisive.

The most critical factor, however, appears to have been the ongoing struggle in Congress over economic relief — a battle that ultimately put Trump’s White House at odds with Mitch McConnell’s obstructionist instincts and helped put the prospect of $2,000 relief checks front and center. Polling throughout the state certainly suggests a strong appetite for immediate financial relief. A CNN exit poll, for example, found some 54 percent of Georgian voters reporting that the pandemic has caused them financial hardship, with another analysis from Fox finding 70 percent dissatisfied with Congress’s efforts to offer financial assistance during the pandemic. Both Warnock and Ossoff put the push for $2,000 relief checks, long championed by Bernie Sanders and finally endorsed by president-elect Joe Biden a few days ago, at the center of their campaigns — a strategy that appears to have redounded to the Democrats’ benefit.

However we choose to account for the result, it looks like Joe Biden will be entering office amid Democratic control of both the House and the Senate — marking the first time the party has held all three branches since its wipeout in the 2010 midterms. Put simply, this state of affairs potentially gives the Democrats tremendous latitude to pass legislation (starting with immediate $2,000 relief checks) if, as a caucus, they actually want to. Though the bogeyman of GOP obstruction has always been a bit of a chimera, given the sweeping executive powers afforded to the president, a working majority in both houses of Congress means that any decision to court Republican votes will be made by choice.

In this regard, anyone hoping that the Democrats’ newly secured legislative power will be used to pass an ambitious progressive agenda is likely to be disappointed. Votes were still being counted, and Joe Manchin, one of the party’s most conservative members, was already heralding a new era of bipartisan cooperation. Biden’s own statement this morning seemed to signal much the same:

Georgia’s voters delivered a resounding message yesterday: they want action on the crises we face and they want it right now . . . They want us to move, but move together. I’m pleased that we will be able to work with Speaker Pelosi and a Majority Leader Schumer. But I’m also just as determined today as I was yesterday to try to work with people in both parties — at the federal, state, and local levels — to get big things done.

Give the president-elect’s long-standing embrace of bipartisan compromise as an end in itself, this is hardly surprising. The truth is that Biden’s conservative inclinations make him much more likely to broker across the aisle than compromise with the progressive wing of his own party. Nonetheless, given the outcome of Georgia’s two Senate runoffs, any decision to govern this way will be a voluntary choice — and no one should allow the Democratic leadership to pretend otherwise."	left

i8rzzf	sandersforpresident	Ilhan Omar's Win Means the Whole Squad Is Likely Headed Back to Congress	"As of Wednesday morning, Representative Ilhan Omar (D-MN) was cruising on a nearly 30,000-vote lead in a Democratic primary that saw her pitted against any extremely well-funded challenger. As CNN reported, Antone Melton-Meaux nearly matched Omar’s fundraising in a closely watched challenge to one of Congress’s best-known progressives. But more than $4 million for Melton-Meaux didn’t translate to a close race at the ballot box, as currently available results show Omar racked up almost 60% of the vote.

Omar’s victory practically assures that the Minnesota congresswoman will be headed back to Capitol Hill for another term, as Democrats have dominated her district for years. It also means it’s looking extremely likely that all four members of the Squad — Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) — are returning to Congress after this year’s November election.

“In Minnesota, we know that organized people will always beat organized money. Tonight, our movement didn’t just win. We earned a mandate for change. Despite outside efforts to defeat us, we once again broke turnout records,” Omar wrote on Twitter late Tuesday. “Despite the attacks, our support has only grown.”

That growing support translated to nearly 30,000 more votes than she earned in her 2018 primary. And she’s not the only Squad member to see a huge surge in votes cast in her favor. AOC also jumped up about 30,000 votes from her 2018 primary, and Tlaib upped her vote total by almost 44,000 votes. Ocasio-Cortez’s and Tlaib’s districts have also been tough sledding for Republicans for decades now.

Teen Vogue cover star Pressley is running completely unopposed in both her Democratic primary set for September 1 and in November’s general election. If AOC, Tlaib, and Omar are as dominant in 2020 as they were in 2018, it looks more than likely that all four of them will become second-term representatives.

According to The Nation, AOC addressed the primary challenges Squad members have faced, saying in a message circulated Monday by the Working Families Party, “It’s not an accident that Ilhan and I had primary challengers. Because when you speak truth to power, power fights back.”

Tlaib celebrated Omar’s win on Twitter Tuesday night, writing, “Our squad is big!” Pressley chimed in as well, writing, “This movement is powerful.” Support also came from congressional primary winners who may be on their way to becoming the latest Squad members to walk the hall of Congress; Jamaal Bowman and Cori Bush also celebrated online."	left

Free college could soon be a reality for many Americans.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., on Wednesday introduced the College for All Plan, legislation that would make a college education free for millions and lend extra support to those from working-class families attending minority institutions.

""In the wealthiest country in the history of the world, a higher education should be a right for all, not a privilege for the few,"" Sanders said in a statement. ""If we are going to have the kind of standard of living that the American people deserve, we need to have the best educated workforce in the world.""

hrobrw	sandersforpresident	Senate Democrats’ Machine Spent $15 Million To Destroy Progressive Primary Candidates	"The Democratic establishment has successfully blocked progressive Senate candidates in primaries, with the help of labor unions, Wall Street tycoons and corporate interests.

Senate Democrats’ political machine has spent more than $15 million to help more moderate Senate candidates defeat progressive primary challengers in the 2020 election cycle.

With the help of the party, its major donors, and the Senate Majority PAC (SMP) -- a super PAC funded by labor unions, corporate interests and Wall Street billionaires -- candidates endorsed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee have won contested primaries in four battleground states.

While the DSCC’s chair, Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, said last year the party would support progressive incumbent Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey if he faced a primary challenger, he hasn’t seen any outside help yet from the DSCC or SMP in his tough battle with Rep. Joseph Kennedy III.

Colorado was the most emblematic example of the party putting its thumb on the scale against progressives: There, former Gov. John Hickenlooper cruised to a primary victory over former Colorado House Speaker Andrew Romanoff. In the final weeks of the race, SMP spent $1 million to boost Hickenlooper, after he spent his failed presidential campaign attacking key tenets of progressives’ legislative agenda, including Medicare for All and the Green New Deal.

At the time of the cash infusion, Hickenlooper was losing ground in the polls and engulfed in scandals: He had just been fined by Colorado’s Independent Ethics Commission for violating state ethics law as governor, the local CBS station uncovered evidence of his gubernatorial office raking in cash from oil companies, and a video circulated showed Hickenlooper comparing his job as a politician to a slave on a slave ship, being whipped by a scheduler.

With the help of SMP and the endorsement of the DSCC, Hickenlooper held off the more progressive Romanoff to win a 17 point primary victory.

Unions, Billionaires, and Corporate Interests

SMP is led byformer top staffers at the DSCC. The super PAC has raised a staggering $118 million this cycle, pooling cash from both organized labor and business titans to promote corporate-aligned candidates over more progressive primary challengers.

Working for Working Americans, a super PAC funded by the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, has donated $5 million. The Laborers' International Union of North America’s super PAC has given $1.5 million. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers’s political action committee has chipped in $1.3 million. SMP has received also big donations from groups affiliated with labor unions like the Service Employees International Union ($1 million), the National Association of Letter Carriers ($750,000), and Communications Workers of America ($500,000).

Overall, the top donor to SMP so far this cycle has been Democracy PAC -- a super PAC that’s bankrolled by billionaire George Soros and the Fund for Policy Reform, a nonprofit funded by Soros. Democracy PAC has contributed $8.5 million to SMP.

Other donors from the financial industry include: Renaissance Technologies founder and billionaire Jim Simons ($3.5 million) and billionaire D. E. Shaw & Co. founder David Shaw ($1 million).

Some major donors have financial stakes in current and future legislation.

For instance: SMP received a $1 million donation from billionaire Jonathan Gray, an executive at Blackstone, which owns the hospital staffing chain, TeamHealth. SMP also received $2 million from the Greater New York Hospital Association.

In late 2019, Schumer helped stall Senate legislation that would have kept patients from receiving “surprise medical bills,” the hefty charges that occur when they visit hospitals that are in their insurance network but are unknowingly treated by providers who are considered out-of-network.

SMP is affiliated with Majority Forward, a dark money group focused on attacking Republican Senate candidates. Majority Forward received $450,000 in 2018 from pharmacy giant CVS Health -- which also owns health insurer Aetna. The group also received $300,000 from the American Health Care Association (AHCA), a trade association that represents the nursing home industry.

The Democratic primary candidates backed by the DSCC have expressed reservations about Medicare for All, arguing they believe people should be allowed to keep their private health insurance if they want it. Many of the DSCC’s favored candidates do support creating a public health insurance option.

Meanwhile, the Real Estate Roundtable, a trade group for real estate investors, donated $50,000 to Majority Forward. Schumer and Senate Democrats recently helped Republicans unanimously pass pandemic relief legislation that included a special, little-noticed provision that amounted to $170 billion worth of new tax breaks for wealthy real estate investors.

Deciding Primaries

In addition to the Colorado race, SMP has waded into at least three other Senate primaries this year.

In North Carolina, SMP funded Carolina Blue, a super PAC that spent $4.5 million to help veteran and former state senator Cal Cunningham win the primary in March. Cunningham handily defeated his chief opponent, state senator Erica Smith, who was running to his left. (Republicans, for their part, also tried to influence the primary, spending $2.7 million to boost Smith.)

In Iowa, SMP spent nearly $7 million to promote real estate developer Theresa Greenfield. She easily bested her two primary opponents, including progressive Kimberly Graham, who campaigned in support of Medicare for All and the Green New Deal.

SMP has already spent more than $2 million in Maine, including nearly $500,000 to promote House Speaker Sara Gideon in the Democratic primary. Some of the group’s advertising against Republican Senator Susan Collins was also designed to boost Gideon.

On Tuesday, Gideon won the primary decisively, defeating two candidates, including Betsy Sweet, a former lobbyist for progressive advocacy groups who supported the Green New Deal and Medicare for All.

i7qd0h	sandersforpresident	Sanders Joins Calls for Resignation or Removal of Postmaster General Over Efforts to 'Suppress the Vote and Undermine Democracy'	"Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday became the latest lawmaker to demand the immediate resignation or removal of Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a major Republican donor to President Donald Trump whose brief tenure as head of the most popular government institution in the U.S. has brought major nationwide slowdowns in package delivery less than 90 days before an election that could hinge on mail-in ballots.

""Make no mistake about it. This is a blatant attempt by Trump's handpicked Postmaster General (and campaign contributor) to sabotage the Postal Service, suppress the vote, and undermine democracy,"" the Vermont senator tweeted in response to the Postal Service's decision to charge states higher rates to mail ballots to voters.

""The Postmaster General should either resign or be removed from office—immediately,"" said Sanders.

Make no mistake about it. This is a blatant attempt by Trump's handpicked Postmaster General (and campaign contributor) to sabotage the Postal Service, suppress the vote and undermine democracy. The Postmaster General should either resign or be removed from office — immediately. https://t.co/FB9r80Oip7 — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) August 10, 2020

Sanders joined a growing chorus of lawmakers and ordinary Americans calling for the swift removal of DeJoy, a former North Carolina logistics executive with tens of millions invested in USPS competitors. In statements over the weekend, Reps. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.) and Alma Adams (D-N.C.) said DeJoy should be removed from his post for threatening ""the voting rights of millions of Americans"" to ""aid Trump's reelection efforts.""

Additionally, more than 330,000 people have signed a MoveOn.org petition urging the USPS Board of Governors to oust DeJoy over ""actions that are disrupting the mission of the United States Postal Service."" The board—which appointed DeJoy in May despite his complete lack of experience at the Postal Service and potential conflicts of interest—has the authority to remove a sitting Postmaster General with a majority vote.

""With a federal election less than three months away in the midst of a global pandemic,"" the petition reads, ""it is imperative that the timely delivery of United States mail be made a priority. Mr. DeJoy is a barrier to this necessity.""

Demands for DeJoy's removal have intensified in the wake of his displacement late last week of nearly two dozen top Postal Service officials, a move that was immediately dubbed a ""Friday Night Massacre"" by lawmakers and critics.

In addition to pressure to step aside, DeJoy is also facing a Senate investigation into his operational changes barring overtime and prohibiting postal workers from sorting mail ahead of their morning deliveries—policies that have alarmed USPS employees and union leaders. Last week, as Common Dreams reported, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) spearheaded a call for the USPS inspector general to launch a probe into DeJoy's actions as well as his potential conflicts of interest.

Warren repeated the demand for an investigation in a tweet Monday, writing that ""there is nothing normal about a Trump campaign megadonor with at least $30 million invested in USPS competitors being appointed as Postmaster General to sabotage our mail delivery and threaten our elections.""

""The USPS inspector general must investigate this corruption now,"" Warren added."	left
lrnjtu	sandersforpresident	Bernie Sanders approval rating higher than Biden and Harris as he champions minimum wage and stimulus checks	"Bernie Sanders’s approval rating is currently higher than both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, according to a new poll.

The ratings come as the senator calls for a $15 (£11) minimum wage to be included as part of the $1.9 trillion (£1.2 trillion) coronavirus stimulus passing through Congress this week.

Mr Sanders had a net favourability rating of 10 points among survey respondents, according to the poll released on Tuesday by The Economist/YouGov while the US president had a net favourability rating of 8 points, and the vice president 5 points.

49 per cent said they had a ""somewhat"" or ""very"" favourable view of Mr Sanders, while 39 per cent said they had a very or ”somewhat” or “very” unfavourable view.

Mr Biden, meanwhile, was viewed favourably by 50 per cent of respondents, and unfavourably by another 42 per cent, while Ms Harris was viewed favourably by 49 per cent and unfavourably by 43 per cent.

Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican minority leader, was viewed unfavourably by 65 per cent of respondents to the survey, and favourable by as few as 17 per cent, after previously blocking proposals for $2,000 stimulus checks to be sent as part of a coronavirus stimulus bill.

Mr McConnell said on Monday that the Biden administration’s $1.9 trillion (£1.2 trillion) package was “more band-aid policies”, while two Republican senators proposed a lower $10 (£7) minimum wage increase.

As doubt remains over the provision’s inclusion in the $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus package, the parliamentarian of the Senate, Elizabeth MacDonough, is expected to make a decision on whether or not the provision can be included in the stimulus package in the coming days.

The stimulus is expected to be passed by a process of budget reconciliation, which requires legislation to have more than an “incidental” impact on the overall budget.

That would allow the stimulus to pass the Senate with a simple majority of 51 votes, and without 60 votes from Republican senators to overcome a filibuster that is typically required to pass bills.

Mr Biden, according to the White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday, “stands by” the $15 minimum wage proposal despite fears that some Democrats could vote against the provision, reported Newsweek.

Mr Sanders, meanwhile, argued on Saturday that the historic wage increase was comparable to a Republican tax bill in 2017 that allowed the opening of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil drilling and repeal of some provisions of Affordable Care Act', as CNN reported."	left

jfb449	sandersforpresident	California Republican Party says it will not comply with state's cease and desist order on ballot drop boxes	"(CNN) The California Republican Party said Wednesday it will not comply with the state's cease-and-desist order over unofficial ballot drop boxes placed in at least four counties, escalating a brewing political showdown ahead of the November election.

The unauthorized ballot boxes, which state officials have called illegal, have been found in at least four counties across the state: Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange and Fresno.

""Ballot harvesting program will continue,"" California Republican Party spokesman Hector Barajas said in a statement to CNN.

The fight over the unofficial drop boxes comes as the coronavirus pandemic has led to historic interest in mail-in voting , even as President Donald Trump and the GOP have spent months attacking the integrity of mail ballots and fighting in court against drop boxes. Trump has repeatedly made unfounded claims that the election tally will be fraudulent because of the proliferation of mail-in voting and drop box usage and has warned that he may not agree to a peaceful transfer of power due to those misleading beliefs.

The party made their intentions clear in a letter to the California Secretary of State on Wednesday. In the letter, attorneys for the state GOP say all of the ballot boxes deployed by the party are indoors, staffed by volunteers or party officials, secure and not labeled ""official.""

hqfgo9	sandersforpresident	Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Campaign Workers Just Ratified A Union Contract	"As part of the contract, Ocasio-Cortez campaign staff secured a salary floor of at least $4,000 per month, an $18 minimum wage for hourly employees, and a number of paid leave policies. Notably, the contract caps salaries for managers, making it so that the highest paid employee of her campaign is paid at a rate no more than three times the rate of the lowest paid full-time employee. Putting a salary limit on managers is still uncommon, but staffers for Bernie Sanders’s 2020 presidential campaign locked down a similar provision in their contract earlier this year.

New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign staff have just reached a deal to unionize with the Campaign Workers Guild, ratifying a two-year contract that includes overtime pay above 40 hours per week (which is virtually unheard of on campaigns), unlimited sick leave, and language protecting immigrant and transgender workers.

Though the union didn’t provide the full contract, excerpts shared with The Intercept show entire sections dedicated to robust anti-discrimination policies and to fighting the exploitative working conditions that often develop in political campaigns, which can be grueling. And as one of the more progressive Democrats in Congress, the unionization of Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign staff is also about the political messaging in the contract, and the lawmaker practicing the same policies she promotes. Members of the bargaining committee told The Intercept that they hope their contract inspires other campaigns to fight for these protections, though they ultimately want these rights to be universal and extended to every worker.

The deal also includes paid time off to vote in any election, at least 12 weeks of paid parental leave, an upcoming bonus, a fund to help underwrite classes to help with professional development, and stipends to cover remote work-related expenses and even child care.

“Workers’ rights are the cornerstone of an economy that puts humanity first,” Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement announcing the contract. “I’ve lived without health insurance or dignity in the workplace, and I applaud the work our team has done to raise the bar for all workers.”

Campaign workers “more often than not are subjected to work environments that do not prioritize the health, safety, and comfort of their staff but instead prioritize winning,” said Ariella Schwartz.

“There are thousands of elected officials across the country from community boards to the president, and there are exponentially more people who helped each one of those people get elected — who more often than not are subjected to work environments that do not prioritize the health, safety, and comfort of their staff but instead prioritize winning,” said Ariella Schwartz, events manager for Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign and a bargaining team member. “These people work essentially in a gig economy and jump from race to race, trying to make the world a better place. We felt empowered and hope to empower other campaigns to unionize to make working conditions better on all campaigns.”

In a section on “gender neutrality,” the contract says that the campaign will issue a rule to notify employees that transgender and nonbinary employees may use the bathrooms they are most comfortable using, in addition to requiring everyone at the workplace use an employee’s preferred name and pronouns, as well as standardizing gender neutral language in on-boarding materials and policy manuals. Garrick Trapp, deputy policy director and a bargaining committee member, noted that there are non-monetary aspects of their labor contract that other campaigns could immediately adopt.

There’s also a section that outlines protocol for investigating workplace sexual harassment and assault complaints, including a provision saying that no employee will be retaliated against for simply reporting misconduct and perceived retaliation could be grounds for discipline.

Other policies in the contract are meant to encourage a healthy work environment. Unit members, for example, are not required to work with any manager who has more than three documented instances of hostile behavior, and will not be expected to work more than six consecutive work days. But the biggest highlight, according to Meg Reilly, president of the Campaign Workers Guild, is the overtime pay.

“CWG has negotiated dozens of contracts and we’ve gotten close, we’ve fought for overtime in every contract, we have won it quite rarely and it’s a big cultural shift,” Reilly said. “So for these campaign workers across industries to get overtime after 40 [hours] is monumental.”

The Campaign Workers Guild, which was formed in late 2017 by a group of former campaign workers, has represented workers on dozens of campaigns, including Andrew Yang’s and Julián Castro’s for president, and the 2018 campaigns of Jess King in Pennsylvania and Cynthia Nixon in New York. In 2018, the campaign staff of Randy Bryce, a union ironworker who ran for the Wisconsin seat held by then-House Speaker Paul Ryan, made history as the first in the country to form a union."	left

kxa9m5	sandersforpresident	Police Three Times More Likely to use Force Against Left Wing Protesters	"U.S. police are three times as likely to use force against Black Lives Matter demonstrators and other left-wing protests as they are against right-wing or pro-Trump protesters, according to a Guardian analysis of data compiled by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project’s (ACLED) U.S. Crisis Monitor database.

The analysis found that since April, police responded to left-wing protests with methods like batons, rubber bullets and tear gas on 511 occasions, compared to 33 occasions for right-wing protests.

The Guardian’s analysis found this translated to use of force at 4.7 percent of left-wing protests and 1.4 percent of right-wing ones.

ADVERTISEMENT

When the analysis was restricted to peaceful protests, police were even more likely to respond with force.

Police used such methods against 1.8 percent of peaceful left-wing protests compared to 0.5 percent of peaceful right-wing protests.

Law enforcement was also about twice as likely to intervene in left-wing protests than right-wing ones in general, with police arresting participants or otherwise intervening in 9 percent of them since April. Comparatively, they intervened in 4 percent of right-wing demonstrations in the same period.

The ACLED analysis found both right-wing and left-wing demonstrations over the past year were overwhelmingly peaceful, including 94 percent of left-wing protests and 96 percent of right-wing protests.

This aligns with an earlier study indicating 93 percent of Black Lives Matter protests were nonviolent and free of property damage.

“Police are not just engaging more because [left-wing protests] are more violent. They’re engaging more even with peaceful protesters,” Roudabeh Kishi, ACLED’s director of research and innovation, told the Guardian. “That’s the clear trend.”"	left

hr3aiz	sandersforpresident	Study Shows 5.4 Million Have Lost Insurance Amid Pandemic. Progressives Note Number Under Medicare for All Would Be: 0	"Amid the worst public health crisis in a century and a devastating economic downturn that has thrown tens of millions out of work, more than five million people in the U.S. lost their health insurance in just three months this year, shattering the previous record set during the entire annual period from 2008 to 2009.

The estimate by advocacy group Families USA that at least 5.4 million Americans became uninsured between February and May was viewed by progressive activists and lawmakers as the latest evidence of the fundamental brokenness of a privatized system that ties healthcare to employment—and yet another reason Medicare for All is an urgent necessity.

""5.4 million Americans would still be covered if we had Medicare for All.""

—Dr. Abdul El-Sayed

""If we had Medicare for All, nobody would be losing their healthcare,"" Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), lead House sponsor of the Medicare for All Act of 2019, tweeted late Monday in response to the new figures.

Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, a public health expert and former Michigan gubernatorial candidate, echoed Jayapal. ""5.4 million Americans would still be covered if we had Medicare for All,"" El-Sayed tweeted.

According to a report (pdf) released Monday by Families USA, massive job losses caused by the Covid-19 pandemic sparked a sharp rise in uninsurance as millions of people were unable to move to alternative sources of coverage such as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces, Medicaid, or a spouse's employer-provided insurance.

States that have not expanded Medicaid under the ACA saw a much larger rise in uninsurance, leaving millions of vulnerable people on the hook for exorbitant healthcare costs.

""These recent increases in the number of uninsured adults are 39% higher than any annual increase ever recorded,"" Families USA found. ""The highest previous increase took place over the one-year period from 2008 to 2009, when 3.9 million nonelderly adults became uninsured.""

Nearly half of the newly uninsured, according to the group, live in just five states: California, Texas, Florida, New York, and North Carolina.

Despite the alarming spike in the number of uninsured Americans in such a short period, Families USA senior fellow Steve Dorn noted that congressional Covid-19 relief efforts have not even ""attempted to restore or preserve comprehensive health insurance.""

""Now is the time to fill that gap by including protections for comprehensive health insurance in the next Covid-19 bill,"" Dorn wrote.

Companion Video: The #COVID19 Pandemic And Resulting Economic Crash Have Caused The Greatest Health Insurance Losses In American History. pic.twitter.com/iYkrGJvKVL — Families USA (@FamiliesUSA) July 13, 2020

While Families USA endorsed House Democratic proposals to make the ACA more affordable, boost COBRA subsidies, and expand Medicaid, progressives have recommended broader and more ambitious solutions to a healthcare crisis that is only expected to get worse as coronavirus cases and hospitalizations surge across the country.

Jayapal and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), for instance, introduced legislation in April that would expand Medicare to cover all healthcare costs for the uninsured and all out-of-pocket expenses for the privately insured for the duration of the coronavirus pandemic.

""We have got to work together to make sure that anyone in America who is sick—regardless of their income or immigration status—can seek the medical treatment they need during this national emergency,"" Sanders said at the time. ""With an estimated 35 million Americans in danger of losing their employer-provided health insurance over the coming weeks and months, this legislation is needed now more than ever.""

Seriously, how can anyone not support Medicare for All after reading this? https://t.co/kw7y0aHWxL — Public Citizen (@Public_Citizen) July 13, 2020

In a series of tweets Monday, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) urged Democratic leaders to ""stop talking about 'affordable' healthcare and start getting serious about truly universal healthcare.""

""That means everyone in, nobody out. Also known as Medicare for All,"" Khanna wrote. ""Covid-19 and mass unemployment have exposed the cruel folly of tying healthcare to employment. Talking about 'affordable' healthcare isn't enough. We can and must do much better: recognize healthcare as a human right and implement Medicare for All ASAP. Democrats must lead."""	left

jvx3os	sandersforpresident	Medicare for All backers won in safe Democratic districts and Trump country alike this year, while its opponents lost in both. Yet centrists are now leading a campaign to blame M4A for the party’s devastating down-ballot losses this year. They’re wrong.	"The votes were still coming in when the Democratic establishment set the narrative for the party’s 2020 debacle: it was all the Left’s fault for pushing progressive policy like Medicare for All. “When [voters] see the far left that gets all the news media attention, they get scared,” said Rep. Kurt Schrader, member of the conservative Blue Dog Coalition. “They’re very afraid that this will become a supernanny state, and their ability to do things on their own is going to be taken away.” “This playing footsies with socialism is not going to win over most of America,” agreed Rep. Stephanie Murphy, cochair of the Blue Dogs. “There’s no amount of lipstick that can cover up the fact that these far left ideas are costing us races.” Rep. Jim Clyburn warned that if “we are going to run on Medicare for All, defund the police, socialized medicine, we’re not going to win” the upcoming runoff senate contests in Georgia. As the Washington Post put it, the party’s conservatives had examined the rubble of 2020, and decided the GOP had too successfully “tied them to liberal ideas, including Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and cutting police budgets.” But beyond flat assertions by those already hostile to progressive policies, what evidence is there for this charge? Looking at Medicare for All specifically, not a whole lot, it turns out.

Medicare for All in Trump Country The case that socialist ideas sunk Democrats in 2020 is undermined by the fact that every single cosponsor of House Progressive Caucus cochair Pramila Jayapal’s 2019 Medicare for All legislation won reelection this year, the only exceptions being lawmakers who retired, died, gave up their seats, or were unseated in primaries. Seven of these Democratic incumbents were replaced this year by backers of Medicare for All, including the DSA-backed Cori Bush (MO-01) and Jamaal Bowman (NY-16), while four were replaced by Democrats who didn’t support it. One of those is Christy Smith, a self-described “centrist on issues of finance, business and economic issues” who opposes Medicare for All. With 2 percent of the votes yet to be counted, Smith is currently trailing her GOP opponent by 0.04 points, in a district described by the Cook Political Report as evenly split on partisan lines, and which had been carried by her predecessor and Medicare for All cosponsor Katie Hill by nearly 9 points in 2018. Critics would point out that most of those cosponsors reside in safe Democratic seats. But in fact, a number won reelection in competitive swing districts. After flipping the seat in 2018, Matt Cartwright won reelection this year by 3.4 points in Pennsylvania’s 8th district, which has been represented by a Republican for fourteen of the last twenty years, and has voted for Obama twice before voting for Trump in 2016. He did this despite not just cosponsoring Medicare for All, but going on Fox to make the case for it. Incidentally, the district is also the home of Scranton, the working-class town known as the former home of president-elect Joe Biden, who centered both his primary and general election candidacies on his opposition to the policy. Likewise, after winning a 2018 special election for an open seat in Pennsylvania’s 7th district, Susan Wild has now won reelection to the seat for the second time, in a district whose Republican-tilting voting patterns are nearly identical to Pennsylvania’s 8th. Wild won in spite of being on the receiving end of exactly the kinds of GOP attacks that other Democratic supporters of Medicare for All have been subjected to. Three of the bill’s cosponsors won reelection in Republican-leaning districts in California this year, too. Josh Harder (CA-10) won by nearly 11 points in a district that’s voted Republican six of the last ten years, Mike Levin (CA-49) won by 6 points in the seat that Republican Darrell Issa held from 2002 to 2018, and Katie Porter (CA-45) won reelection in an Orange County seat that she flipped in 2018 from unbroken Republican control since it was created thirty-seven years ago. Similarly, their earlier support for the measure and cosponsorship of Jayapal’s bill didn’t doom Jared Golden in Maine’s 2nd congressional district, which had flipped for Trump in 2016, and which he won again this year; Ann Kirkpatrick in Arizona’s 2nd congressional district, which has historically voted Republican; nor Peter DeFazio in Oregon’s 4th district, which Trump had narrowly lost in 2016. (Golden in 2020 backed away from his support for the bill, while Kirkpatrick didn’t run on the measure this year). Of course, one can also point to steadfast Medicare for All backers who lost elections this year. Kara Eastman lost in Nebraska’s formerly Trump-supporting 2nd congressional district, and Mike Siegel (TX-10), Julie Oliver (TX-25), and Donna Imam (TX-31) all lost in gerrymandered, Republican-held Texas districts. But by that same token, one could point to the close but likely losses of Rita Hart (IA-02) and Ben McAdams (UT-04) in districts rated by the Cook Political Report as toss-ups despite their vocal rejection of the policy, as well as the defeat a parade of other Medicare for All–opposing Democrats in other Trump-voting seats, such as Collin Peterson (MN-07, unseated after nearly thirty years), Xochitl Torres Small (NM-02), and Kendra Horn (OK-05). We might also look at the Medicare for All–opposing Democrats who lost in safe Democratic seats this year, such as Donna Shalala and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell in Florida’s Miami-Dade county. Of course, chalking these losses up to the candidates’ positions on Medicare for All would be absurd, given all the factors involved in any given election. The defeat of vulnerable Democrats in Trump country is hardly surprising in a year that saw massive pro-Trump turnout, while Shalala and Mucarsel-Powell were likely victims of Biden’s decision to ban door-knocking and his resulting underperformance in Miami-Dade — a factor that also hurt Seigel, Oliver, and Imam, as well as other, less progressive down-ballot candidates in Texas."	left
indmby	sandersforpresident	Bernie Sanders Says Country Must Get Ready for Trump’s Refusal to Concede	"Bernie Sanders is sounding the alarm. The Vermont senator is warning Americans they have to get ready for the possibility that President Donald Trump will refuse to step down if he loses the election in November. In an interview with Politico and later an email to supporters, which he also summarized in a series of tweets, Sanders says there’s real reason for concern. “This is not just idle speculation,” Sanders told Politico. “Trump was saying … ‘the only way they can take this election away from us is if this is a rigged election.’ Now he is making that statement at a time when virtually every national poll has him behind.” Sanders also pointed to a comment Trump made during a July interview in which he refused to outright say he would accept the results of the election.

Sanders is taking on the issue and plans to speak about it over the next few weeks to raise awareness of what he has characterized as a real possibility. “What we have got to do in the next two months is to alert the American people about what that nightmarish scenario might look like in order to prepare them for that possibility and talk about what we do if that happens,” he said.

We must do everything we can to ensure @JoeBiden wins by the largest possible margin. We also must consider what happens if Trump loses but refuses to abide by the results and does everything he can to hold onto power. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 4, 2020

In his email to supporters, Sanders said Trump is “using his lies and misinformation to sow confusion and chaos in the election process and undermine American democracy.” Sanders goes on to say that Trump “does not intend to accept the results of the election” if he loses. “This is not just a ‘constitutional crisis.’ This is a threat to everything this country stands for,” Sanders writes. The senator says there are several steps that need to be taken to get ready, including making it clear to people that it could take days or weeks to get the results of the election. In order to avoid long delays, state legislatures need to allow counting of mail-in ballots before Election Day. And Sanders is also calling for congressional hearings about how local officials plan to handle the vote-counting process.

Sanders has received support from key Democrats for his initiative, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.* “I’m standing side-by-side with @SenSanders to make sure we have a plan if President Trump refuses to leave office,” Schumer tweeted.

le1obs	sandersforpresident	Bernie was one of only three Senators to vote against keeping the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem	"Last night an amendment to keep the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem passed by a count of 97-3. Only three Senators voted against the motion: Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Tom Carper (D-DE).

The amendment was introduced as part of the budget reconciliation resolution by Senators Jim Inhofe (R-OK) and Bill Hagerty (R-TN). The Trump administration moved the embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv in 2018.

“The Trump Administration kept its promise to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, the eternal and indivisible capital of the Jewish State of Israel, and it should remain there,” said Hagerty in a statement. “As former U.S. Ambassador to Japan, I know how important it is to recognize the core concerns of our allies, and it was a travesty that our government ignored U.S. law and declined to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital for so many decades.”

Although Sanders and Warren voted against the amendment, no candidate came out in support of moving the embassy back during the Democratic primary. “[Joe Biden] would not move the American embassy back to Tel Aviv,” said a campaign spokesman for the future president at the time. “But he would re-open our consulate in East Jerusalem to engage the Palestinians. He would also return the United States to the effort of encouraging a two-state solution — the only way to truly guarantee Israel’s long-term security as a Jewish and democratic state and meet the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians for a state of their own.”"	left
