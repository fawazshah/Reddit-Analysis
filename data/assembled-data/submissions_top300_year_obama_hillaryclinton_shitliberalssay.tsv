Politicians on both sides of the aisle, including former Presidents, presidential candidates, and Congresspeople have taken to Twitter to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on clinching the victory over President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.

""In this election, under circumstances never experienced, Americans turned out in numbers never seen. And once every vote is counted, President-Elect Biden and Vice President-Elect Harris will have won a historic and decisive victory,"" former President Barack Obama wrote in a lengthy statement issued on Twitter.

""I know he'll do the job with the best interests of every American at heart, whether or not he had their vote. So I encourage every American to give him a chance and lend him your support.""

""America has spoken and democracy has won,"" tweeted former President Bill Clinton, less than an hour after the Associated Press officially called the election for Biden after nabbing the necessary electoral college votes.

Hillary Clinton also congratulated Biden and Harris on clinching the victory: ""It's a history-making ticket, a repudiation of Trump, and a new page for America.""

Biden officially won by grabbing Pennsylvania's 20 votes, a crucial swing state in the election that Trump won in 2016.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who ran for the Democratic presidential ticket, congratulated Biden and Harris for the win: ""Let’s go make some big, structural change.""

Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.), who competed against Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination, tweeted a congratulations of not just the incoming President and Vice President, but of grassroots organizers: ""I want to congratulate all those who worked so hard to make this historic day possible.""

Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush was among the few Republicans to cross the aisle. ""I will be praying for you and your success,"" the former Republican presidential prospect tweeted. ""Now is the time to heal deep wounds.""

Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who ran against former President Barack Obama in 2012, also tweeted congratulating Biden and Harris.

Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), following a congratulatory message, shared a days-old clip of CNN correspondent Abby Phillip discussing Trump's political career beginning with falsehoods accusing former President Barack Obama.

""Poetic justice,"" she said.

Below, see how politicians — from former presidents to newly-elected Congresspeople — have responded to Biden and Harris' win.

Obama barely beat Abraham Lincoln as best U.S. president with 18 percent. Trump was at 13 percent with people naming him the best president.

Among the worst, Trump got the highest percentage at 46 percent while Obama got the second highest at 24 percent.

Trump ended his presidency on what some would call a disastrous note as his approval rating leaving office was at its lowest point.

Trump hit that rating after months of peddling election conspiracy theories and being impeached by the House again on a charge of incitement of violence the day of the Capitol riot Jan. 6.

The poll found that 43 percent of people believe Trump had a lot of responsibility for the riot with 47 percent saying the Senate should vote to convict Trump.

Even though 53 percent do not believe Trump should be allowed to run for office again, this will only happen if two-thirds of the Senate convicts Trump.

Although some Republicans seem open to the idea, the Senate would need 17 Republicans to turn on their former party leader in order to get the conviction.

Trump is now in Mar-a-Lago waiting as the Senate impeachment trial occurs while Obama has recently announced he will be opening his presidential center in Chicago.

ktwi8b	obama	Obama and Clinton will join Bush at Biden's inauguration	"Washington (CNN) Former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton will attend President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, officials say, joining former President George W. Bush, who also plans to be in Washington for the official transfer of power.

The decisions, reported midday Friday, came around the same time that President Donald Trump announced he will not attend the ceremony on January 20. A source with knowledge says first lady Melania Trump is also not expected to attend, joining her husband as they leave Washington the day before for their Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, though the source cautioned that plans could change.

An aide to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she will attend, as will former first ladies Michelle Obama and Laura Bush.

Former President Jimmy Carter -- who, at 96, is America's oldest living president -- will not be there as he is unable to travel, and neither will former first lady Rosalynn Carter.

Vice President Mike Pence is planning to attend the inauguration but is waiting on an invitation, a source close to him confirmed to CNN on Thursday.

""A Promised Land"" is the first book of an expected two volumes, which will detail Mr. Obama's first forays into political office, his 2008 election and end with the death of Osama Bin Laden in 2011.

At 768 pages, ""A Promised Land"" is expected to debut with massive demand. According to Mr. Obama's publisher, Penguin Random House, 3 million copies of the U.S edition have already been printed. The book will be released on November 17 and published in 24 languages, including Spanish, Chinese, Greek and Vietnamese.

No such invitation has been extended to President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.

The meeting between sitting presidents and vice presidents and their successors is a time-honored tradition that represents the peaceful transfer of power. But CNN's White House team has reported there are no plans for President Trump to invite Biden to the White House in the coming days. The Trump administration has refused to concede the election or recognize the results as legitimate.

That means Biden can't access additional funds for his transition team, and he hasn't been cleared to receive intelligence briefings, both touchstones of the formal transition process.

l2u6jg	obama	Trump Wanted to Erase Obama’s Legacy. He Failed.	"Photo: Jonathan Ernst/REUTERS

When President Obama left office four years ago, his legacy was dominated by a mood of pervasive defeatism. The shock of Donald Trump’s election loomed over everything Obama had done, casting his supporters into despair and his critics into jubilation. Trump was supposedly poised to wipe away Obama’s achievements. And in a broader sense, the 45th president seemed to have overturned the country’s very sense of itself that Obama had cultivated.

Four years later, we have a more mature, less hysterical perspective on Obama’s tenure. Trump has suffered first an electoral defeat (by a 7 million vote margin) and then a broader repudiation. And the man who beat him is Obama’s vice-president, who campaigned on a Biden-y version of Obama’s program and governing vision: a liberal uniter, appealing to our better angels and expressing confidence that America can rise above its ugliness.

Perhaps Obama’s presidency was not, in fact, dispelled by Trump. Perhaps there was indeed something enduring.

I had the misfortune of timing to publish a book defending Obama’s accomplishments just as Trump was sweeping into office, an event which critics considered to be a completely self-evident negation of my thesis. An instant consensus formed after the election that Trump would sweep away his predecessor’s work. “Obama’s legacy is toast; it’s gone,” said Charles Krauthammer, in an assessment echoed across the political spectrum.

This was the peak moment for a genre that eventually came to be known as “diner journalism,” which presumed Trump Voters held some secret knowledge and represented the authentic America. It was also a moment of peak hubris on the left, which took Hillary Clinton’s defeat as a pure repudiation of Obama and of liberalism as a whole. They knew Clinton had lost because she, and Obama, had associated themself with technocratic neoliberalism. And this belief — well before crushing defeats by Jeremy Corbyn in the U.K. and then Bernie Sanders in the U.S. — created a delirious anticipation that left-wing populism could and would win back the white working class.

The belief that Trump had effectively defeated Obama, not Hillary Clinton, informed the criticism from right and left. A second belief they held was that Trump would surely erase the achievements I was defending. Ben Domenech wrote in National Review that my book’s central thesis is dashed against the sharp rocks of reality,” namely Trump’s victory. “Now Republicans are poised to eviscerate the achievements Chait celebrates,” sneered Timothy Shenk in the left-wing New Republic. Alex Nichols gloated: “Most of the successes Audacity touts will likely be obsolete in the next few months. Congressional Republicans have already begun the process of repealing the Affordable Care Act. The Clean Power Plan is being contested in federal court. Trump pledged to dismantle Dodd-Frank.”

That is not, in fact, what happened. Indeed, while Trump has weakened some Obama accomplishments, his goal of eviscerating Obama’s policies mostly failed. I have not seen anybody revisit the predictions that were so confidently issued four years ago, so it is worth reconsidering what Obama did, and what is left standing as Trump departs the White House for the last time.

***

One of the odd things about the blithe insistence that Trump would wipe away Obama’s achievements is that, for some of them, it was literally impossible to do. Much of Obama’s first year was devoted to rescuing the economy from the economic meltdown he inherited. That project was a success, and what he did could not be erased because that is not how the space-time continuum works.

Obama’s response to the economic crisis — the deepest economic crisis since the Depression — had three major parts. First, he conducted a “stress test” to assess the ongoing viability of the banks, which were presumed to be on the brink of failure in early 2009. Second, he used unspent funds from TARP, passed in 2008, to rescue the auto industry, which was on the brink of bankruptcy, and whose failure would have plunged much of the Midwest into a permanent depression.

Both these maneuvers were deeply controversial at the time. The stress test was mocked as ineffectual, and the auto bailout as a dangerous extension of government power into the marketplace. Yet both succeeded so clearly that their critics stopped attacking either one.

The third measure was the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, known as the stimulus. This, too, provoked intense controversy. Not only did conservatives oppose it, but the broad center — business leaders, moderate columnists and talk-show hosts in the media, and centrist Democrats — considered the deficit, not unemployment, to be the primary problem, and blanched at the idea of increasing it. A widely touted academic paper asserted that the United States sat on the precipice of a level of debt that would plunge it into an inescapable vortex. (Several years later, after its influence had already been felt, the paper was found to have been based on a simple error.)

In recent years, a revisionist history promoted by Obama’s critics on the left has taken hold, which largely blames him for failing to pass an even larger stimulus than the $787 billion he managed to cajole out of Congress. (Obama later finagled several hundred billion dollars in additional stimulus in subsequent lower-profile deals.) Intercept editor Ryan Grim recently gave a thumbnail summary of this now-popular recollection:

It is true that Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel employed profanity, and that the administration proposed a stimulus no higher than a trillion dollars. The reason, though, was not its own reluctance to increase the deficit, but that the bill had to get through a Congress gripped by deficit mania. This meant getting votes from at least two Republican senators.

One can debate whether or not Obama got every last dime there was to wheedle out of the Senate. The point is that Congress, not Obama, was the obstacle. The current view that holds Obama responsible for the insufficiently large stimulus rests on ignoring the political atmosphere at the time; it’s like asking why Franklin Roosevelt didn’t enter World War II in 1939, or why Lincoln didn’t call for ending slavery in 1861.

The debate that existed during Obama’s first term was not how much to increase spending in order to bring down unemployment; it was whether spending should be increased at all, or instead cut. The latter view had the support of the public along with much of the mainstream news media, which framed deficits as the country’s most pressing social problem. It had an articulate spokesperson in Paul Ryan, whose purportedly heartfelt interest in fiscal probity drew admiration across the spectrum.

If you could go back ten years in time, and show Obama and Ryan recent news clips about Congress’s response to the current economic crisis — bipartisan passage of a series of bills totaling trillions in relief — neither man would have any doubt whose ideas ultimately won the day.

***

Trump did try to roll back Obama’s greenhouse-gas regulations. This is part of the now-ordinary push-and-pull of regulations that occurs whenever party control of the White House changes hands. On the whole, though, Obama’s push has gone a lot farther than Trump’s pull. That is not only because Trump’s deregulation was carried out so ham-handedly that courts have overturned his policies at a historic rate. It is also because businesses don’t make long-term investment decisions based on ephemeral regulatory conditions. Firms aren’t going to build a new plant to make gas-guzzlers or energy-hogging appliances if they believe those things will be outlawed in a few years.

Trump of course promised to revive the coal industry and center the American economy on its natural resources. Instead, coal has continued to collapse, and the green-energy transition begun under Obama has churned on. The last budget deal very quietly extended many of Obama’s biggest climate change policies. It increased funding for ARPA-E, the advanced energy research department Obama created in the stimulus. It ratified a ban on hydrofluorocarbons, which Obama negotiated internationally in 2016. And it extended the tax credits for solar and wind energy that were included in the stimulus, and which jumpstarted those industries, which barely existed in 2009, into giants that now employ ten times as many Americans as the fossil-fuel industry.

Trump, to great fanfare, announced he was pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement, the first comprehensive international agreement to set greenhouse-gas reduction benchmarks. But the framework of the agreement did not collapse, and Biden will reenter it immediately.

Trump did not make any serious headway rolling back Dodd-Frank, repeal of which would have required 60 Senate votes. He did devote his first year to a doomed crusade to repeal Obamacare. His attempt left increased public understanding of, and appreciation for, Obama’s health-care reform, and may have done more than anything else to power the midterm election wave. Obamacare not only survived but became the decisive force in depriving Trump of a governing majority.

Now Trump has been defeated by a man who reminded primary voters of his association with Obama so frequently it became a punchline. His victory refutes the widespread assumption that Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 because of (as opposed to despite) her association with the popular Obama.

And Biden is building on Obama’s agenda in almost exactly the same way he would if Obama were beginning a third term. He is reviving the economy (which is in much better shape than the 2009 version) with a huge stimulus. He is proposing to build on Obamacare by bulking up its subsidy levels, adding incentives to cover the people denied access to Medicaid, and attempting to add a public option (which Obama ran on but couldn’t get through Congress.) His climate plan uses the same combination of regulations, green-energy subsidies, and international diplomacy. Biden now has the chance to spend money deploying the green-energy technologies that he and Obama had to prod the market to invent in 2009.

***

Even before he won the 2016 election, Trump was an important character in my book. It advanced two arguments about him. The first was that his candidacy put the lie to the claims conservatives had made about Obama throughout his presidency. Republicans insisted that the right-wing backlash against him was primarily an expression of principled concern over deficit spending and the extension of executive authority. “The Tea Party,” as conservative intellectual Yuval Levin claimed at the time, has “been intensely focused on recovering the U.S. Constitution, and especially its limits on government power.”

Trump himself realized perfectly well that these abstractions had nothing to do with conservative anger against Obama. His nomination, I argued, revealed how little purchase these principles actually had with the base, and the depths of the bad faith with which the party operated during his two terms.

The last four years have borne this out. If Republicans made a checklist of every complaint they made against Obama, and set out to prove that every one of them was a disingenuous pretext, they would hardly have done anything different. It is difficult even to remember now how serious were the intellectual arguments that swirled around Obama’s energetic and creative uses of government. Trump has put them all to rest.

The second argument I made about Trump was that, in the long run, he would be a wrong turn in American history. “Demagogues and bigots will always have their day,” I argued, but “Obama, not Trump, is destined to supply the model for American governance in the decades to come.”

Now that repudiation I predicted is at hand. Trump has lost the popular vote twice, and been impeached as many times. His approval ratings have sunk to around 30 percent, half the level of where Obama’s stood when he left office. His Republican partners are already whispering they were privately against him all along. His anathematization by social media, corporate America, and other mainstream institutions is a preview of the place he will occupy in the popular imagination. He will join the likes of Andrew Johnson, Joe McCarthy, and George Wallace as an enemy of the civic creed. A century from now, Obama’s name — not Trump’s — will adorn schools, roads, and plazas.

Trump was consumed with envy for his predecessor and obsessed with undoing his work. His failure was nearly total. Even as Trump’s ephemeral imprint on public life — primarily corporate tax cuts that will be rolled back next time a liberal majority has to pay for a social program — evaporates, leaving behind little but a residue of seedy crimes, Obama’s will remain."	left

John Lewis is ""smiling"" down on Georgia after the historic election of the Rev. Raphael Warnock, who will become the state's first Black senator.

""My friend John Lewis is surely smiling down on his beloved Georgia this morning, as people across the state carried forward the baton that he and so many others passed down to them,"" Obama said in a statement. ""Georgia's first Black senator will make the chamber more reflective of our country as a whole and open the door for a Congress that can forego gridlock for gridlock's sake to focus instead on the many crises facing our nation—pandemic relief for struggling families, voting rights, protecting our planet, and more.""

The senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Martin Luther King Jr.'s church, will be the first Black Democrat to represent a southern state in the Senate. He will be the 11th Black lawmaker to serve in the US Senate -- a group that includes Obama, who served as a US senator from Illinois, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, a US senator from California.

CNN projected early Wednesday morning that Warnock beat incumbent Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, with Black voters in the Atlanta metro area, the cradle of the Civil Rights Movement, and suburbs turning out to solidify his win. Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff is holding a narrow lead over incumbent Republican Sen. David Perdue and declared victory Wednesday but CNN has not yet called the race.

Obama said although the runoff race between Ossoff and Perdue has not been called, Warnock's win along with President-elect Joe Biden's win in the Peach state ""is a testament to the power of the tireless and often unheralded work"" of grassroots organizing and credited the efforts of Stacey Abrams.

Show Caption Hide Caption US economy 101: National debt vs. national deficit The U.S. national debt and deficit have become buzzwords for the 2020 election. But what's the difference? Just the FAQs, USA TODAY

The claim: Clinton and Obama were the only presidents to lower the deficit in the last 50 years

A few posts from 2018 about presidential administrations and the federal deficit have resurfaced on Facebook in recent weeks.

The posts feature photos of Democratic Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, and pose the question, ""Why do Republicans claim to be fiscally conservative when these are the only two presidents to lower the deficit in the last 50 years?""

Erlene King — a user who shared a version of the post — told USA TODAY she believes it is ""100% true.""

""A Democrat is mostly elected after a Republican screw things up. Then Republican Senators become fiscally responsible, forcing the Democrat to just fix the problem and never vote for social programs,"" she wrote. ""Thus the lower deficit.""

What is the federal deficit?

Like any entity, the federal government generates revenue and racks up expenses on an annual basis.

Its revenue comes from sources like federal income taxes. Its expenses are determined by the federal budget, and include federal benefits and funding for federal agencies, per USA.gov.

If total revenue exceeds total expenses, the difference is called a ""surplus."" If total expenses exceed total revenues, the difference is called a ""deficit."" The figure is specific to each fiscal year.

The federal government typically operates at a deficit rather than a surplus. The accumulated federal budget deficits, plus other off-budget expenses, comprise the federal debt, per the Treasury Department.

Fact check: Obama, Bush and Clinton would publicly get vaccinated to boost confidence

Who lowered the federal deficit?

The claim in the viral post centers on presidents who left office with less of a deficit than when they entered the White House.

The Office of Management and Budget has tracked the federal government's revenues, expenses and surpluses/deficits from 1789 to 2025 (fiscal years beyond the current one are estimates). Let's look at the last five decades.

President Richard Nixon entered the White House in 1969. At the time, there was a $3.2 billion surplus. By the time he resigned in 1974, there was a $6.1 billion deficit.

That was the baseline for President Gerald Ford, who took over in 1974. By the time he left the White House in 1977, the deficit had grown to $53.7 billion.

That was the starting point for President Jimmy Carter when he entered the White House in 1977. By the time he left in 1981, it had grown to $78.9 billion.

That was the baseline for President Ronald Reagan when he entered the White House in 1981. By the time he exited in 1989, the deficit had doubled to $152.6 billion.

That was the starting point for President George H.W. Bush, who entered the White House in 1989. By the time he left in 1993, the deficit had grown over $100 billion to $255 billion.

That was the baseline for President Bill Clinton, who entered the White House in 1993. By the time he exited, there was a $128.2 billion surplus.

That was the starting point for President George W. Bush, who took over the White House in 2001. By the time he left in 2009, there was a $1.41 trillion deficit.

That was the baseline for President Barack Obama, who entered the White House in 2009. By the time he exited in 2017, there was a $665.4 billion deficit — about half of what it was when he entered.

That was the starting point for President Donald Trump, who came to the White House in 2017. By the time Trump leaves in 2021, there will be a $966 billion deficit, according to estimates from the Office of Management and Budget.

According to those figures, it's true that just Clinton and Obama — the only Democrats besides Carter in the last 50 years — left the Oval Office in a year with a lower deficit than the year when they arrived.

Some other presidents lowered the deficit midway through their terms, but they all exited the White House in a year with a higher deficit than the year they entered.

What's behind the deficits and surpluses?

Joann Weiner, an economics professor at George Washington University, told USA TODAY that ""it is true, in fact, that Republicans create deficits and Democrats reduce deficits, by their personal choices.""

Tax cuts, for example — a hallmark of Republican presidencies — reduce the government's revenue and make a deficit more likely.

""Presidents don't control every lever in the economy,"" she said. ""However, a lot of those specific policies do either add or subtract from the budget deficit, and in general, Democrats are better at handling the deficit than Republicans are.""

Stephen Ellis, the president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, told USA TODAY that some responsibility for the deficit also falls to Congress.

""Any President bears some responsibility for the deficit, but so does Congress, they are passing the spending bills that the President signs,"" he wrote.

Ellis noted that divided government — in which the White House and Congress are controlled by different parties — also tends to ""restrain some of the spending.""

It's worth noting that how each president grew or shrunk the budget deficit over their terms in office is distinct from how much they added to total federal debt.

""Reducing the deficit every year doesn't mean that debt is going to go away,"" Weiner explained.

The Treasury Department has been tracking accumulated debt since 1993, and it has grown under each presidential administration, per Business Insider.

Under Clinton, federal debt grew $1.49 trillion.

""The debt is the nation’s accumulated annual deficits over all the years,"" Ellis wrote. ""Even though Clinton had some surpluses, the accumulated deficits were more in excess of that.""

Under Bush, the federal debt increased $4.30 trillion. Under Obama, it grew another $8.95 trillion.

It's too soon to say the final figure for Trump. But so far, under his administration, federal debt has increased about $7 trillion, per USA TODAY.

Fact check: After endorsing him, New York Post now pushes Trump to accept Biden's victory

Our rating: Missing context

It's true that Clinton and Obama were the only presidents in the last five decades to exit the White House in a year with a lower deficit than the year when they entered. But some other presidents lowered the deficit midway through their terms. Presidents are also not solely responsible for changes in the deficit; for example, Congress plays a role. It's also worth noting that the deficit is distinct from the federal debt — which increased under both Clinton and Obama. As a result, we rate these posts MISSING CONTEXT, because without additional information they could be misleading.

lqqu0e	obama	Obama says he once broke a classmate's nose for calling him a racial slur	"Former President Obama says he once broke a schoolmate's nose after the then-friend called him a racial slur during a locker room fight.

The 44th president shared the revelation in an episode of his Spotify podcast with Bruce Springsteen, ""Renegades,"" released Monday.

""Listen, when I was in school, I had a friend. We played basketball together,"" Obama told the ""Born in the U.S.A."" singer during a wide-ranging conversation on race.

ADVERTISEMENT

""And one time we got into a fight and he called me a c---,"" Obama said about 13 minutes into the episode before quipping of his Aloha State upbringing to chuckles from Springsteen, ""Now first of all, ain’t no c---s in Hawaii, right?""

""It’s one of those things that — where he might not even known what a c--- was — what he knew was, 'I can hurt you by saying this,'"" Obama, 59, continued.

The country's first Black president added with a laugh, ""And I remember I popped him in the face and broke his nose. And we were in the locker room.""

""Well done,"" Springsteen remarked.

""I explained to him — I said, 'Don’t you ever call me something like that,'"" Obama recalled.

It is believed to the first time the former president has discussed the incident publicly.

Hurling racial slurs, he said, comes down to ""an assertion of status over the other.""

""'I may be poor. I may be ignorant. I may be mean. I may be ugly. I may not like myself. I may be unhappy. But you know what I’m not?'"" Obama said to Springsteen. ""'I’m not you.'""

""That basic psychology that then gets institutionalized is used to justify dehumanizing somebody, taking advantage of 'em, cheatin' 'em, stealin' from 'em, killin' 'em, raping 'em,"" said Obama.

""Whatever it is, at the end of the day it really comes down to that. And in some cases it’s as simple as, you know, 'I’m scared I’m insignificant and not important. And this thing is the thing that’s going to give me some importance.'""

Obama has repeatedly discussed the lingering impacts of racism on American society, both in office and since leaving it.

He evoked a racial slur in a 2015 interview to warn that America is not ""cured"" of racism. In his comments, made following a deadly shooting at a historically black church in South Carolina, Obama said, ""It's not just a matter of it not being polite to say [the N-word] in public. That's not the measure of whether racism still exists or not. It's not just a matter of overt discrimination. Societies don't, overnight, completely erase everything that happened 200 to 300 years prior."""	left

k2sl2o	obama	"Obama's ""A Promised Land"" sells more than 1.7 million copies in its first week, breaking records"	"Former President Obama's memoir, ""A Promised Land,"" has sold more than 1.7 million copies in its first week — breaking records for publisher Penguin Random House. On its first day, Mr. Obama's book sold a whopping 887,000 units in all formats and editions in the U.S. and Canada, Penguin Random House announced on Wednesday. That is the publisher's largest first-day sales total ever.

The memoir also broke the publisher's one-week sales record with a total of 1,710,443 units sold after it was released on November 17.

The hardcover edition of ""A Promised Land"" has 4.3 million copies in print in the U.S. and Canada after an initial printing of 3.4 million copies, Penguin Random House said. It is the number one bestselling book in the U.K. The book was published in 20 languages and will be printed in six more.

While Mr. Obama's book sales are quite impressive, his wife, Michelle Obama, set a high precedent with her memoir, ""Becoming,"" published in 2018. According to Bertelsmann SE, the German media and services conglomerate that has a controlling stake in Penguin Random House, ""Becoming"" surpassed 10 million copies sold in 2019 — and those stats only include the company's English, Spanish and German-language territories.

""I'm not aware, in my personal experience with Penguin Random House, that we ever sold 10 million units of a memoir,"" chief executive Markus Dohle told The Wall Street Journal at the time.

The memoir's history-making release was also followed by a sold-out tour. Penguin Random House reportedly made a more than $30 million deal with the Obamas for both of their books in 2017.

Mr. Obama's ""A Promised Land"" is the first book in a series of two, according to the publisher. The release date for the second volume has yet to be announced.

In the memoir, Mr. Obama tells ""the story of his improbable odyssey from young man searching for his identity to leader of the free world, describing in strikingly personal detail both his political education and the landmark moments of the first term of his historic presidency—a time of dramatic transformation and turmoil,"" according to Penguin Random House."	left

There are bad dreams, there are full-on nightmares, and then there’s what unfolded on Friday night in a ballroom in The Villages, a retirement community in Florida: a rally hosted by right-wing provocateurs Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL). The two joined forces to launch what they’re calling a series of America First rallies, because why make America great again when you can just make it 2016 again? And while The Villages is not in Gaetz’s district, or in Greene’s state, these two hope to win over former President Donald Trump loyalists in their ongoing battle for control of the Republican Party. “I just got to check something: I just want to make sure I’m in the right place,” Greene yelled at the mostly unmasked voters. “Tell me who is your president?” “Donald Trump!” the crowd yelled back. “That’s my president, too,” Greene responded, to the delight of those in attendance. Last year, 60% of voters living in The Villages voted for Trump, making the location a prime spot for Greene and Gaetz’s Make America 2016 Again kickoff rally. Among the cringe-worthy pair’s targets was Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), who has been firmly anti-Trump while the majority of her party grovels in front of the twice-impeached former president and reality-television host. House Republicans are set to vote on removing Cheney, who is the number-three Republican in the House, from her leadership role as early as Wednesday in response to her voting to impeach Trump and denouncing the party’s decision to perpetuate the “Big Lie” — that the 2020 election was “stolen” from Trump. (Hint: It wasn’t.) “If Liz Cheney could even find Wyoming on a map and went there, she would find a lot of very angry cowboys are not happy,” Gaetz said during the rally. “She’s sort of for every war: War in Syria — for it. War against Trump and his supporters — for it. War against the Republican conference; war against her own voters.” The audacity of conflating a civil war in Syria that, to date, has resulted in the deaths of at least 380,000 civilians to the decision to hold a president responsible for inciting a violent coup aside, Gaetz and Greene appearing onstage together is arguably one of the more disturbing recent GOP moments. Greene, who subscribes to “save the children” QAnon conspiracy theories, apparently finds no fault in rubbing shoulders with a man currently under federal investigation for trafficking underage girls across state lines. Nor does Greene seem to mind the corroborated reports that Gaetz showed other people in Congress naked pictures and videos of women he claims to have slept with. Then again, Gaetz has previously claimed to be “proud” to be in Greene’s corner, despite her having said she believes the 9/11 terrorist attacks were a hoax, the mass shooting in Parkland was staged, and that the California wildfires were started by Jewish space lasers. “Marjorie Taylor Greene and I work in Washington, but we are not of Washington, and I must honestly tell you the leaders of both parties in Washington, D.C., don’t work for America first,” Gaetz said during the rally. And while Gaetz and Greene standing side-by-side on stage, pontificating on the importance of moving the Republican Party to a Trump-first agenda, is truly the stuff of nightmares, the only thing scarier than Gaetz-Greene rallies is the idea that they will be successful in bringing more people to their side: The Villages is just their first stop. If the GOP remains full of Trump-like politicians: happy to disregard science, and willing to uphold white supremacy. Like what you see?

jfnvz9	obama	Obama delivers a blistering rebuke of Trump in his return to the campaign trail	"(CNN) Former President Barack Obama delivered an often-incredulous and blistering account of his successor's first four years in office on Wednesday in Philadelphia, making his most direct attacks on President Donald Trump to date both on substance and on a personal level.

The event is Obama's first stump speech for his former vice president, a welcome sight to Democrats who see the former president as Joe Biden's most potent character witness and a key factor in encouraging Black men, Latinos and younger voters to turn out and vote.

Obama's speech represented his most direct attacks on Trump to date, with the former Democratic leader leveling both substantive critiques -- like questioning Trump's tax policy and handling of the coronavirus pandemic -- and personal barbs, jabbing at shrinking ratings for the President's speeches and town halls. The former President wasted no time lacing into Trump, opening the remarks by mocking him for telling an audience in Erie, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday night that he wouldn't have visited the area if not for the coronavirus hurting his political fortunes.

The remarks drilled down on years of Democratic concerns about the President, with Obama arguing Trump's presidency has not only changed the way other countries view the United States but remade the way Americans feel about politics.

""I never thought Donald Trump would embrace my vision or continue my polices, but I did hope for the sake of the country, that he might show some interest in taking the job seriously,"" Obama said. ""But it hasn't happened. He hasn't showed any interest in doing the work or helping anybody but himself and his friends.""

The former President directly attacked Trump's handling of the coronavirus, the issue that is dominating the 2020 campaign.

He noted that Trump recently said that there is ""not much"" he would change about the US response to the pandemic that has killed over 220,000 people in the United States.

""Really?"" Obama asked. ""Not much? Nothing you can think of that could have helped some people keep their loved ones alive?""

As Obama spoke at the drive-in rally, standing against the backdrop of Lincoln Financial Field, people sounded air horns and car horns in approval throughout his speech. People stood at a distance, waving flags and banners against the setting sun.

""This is not a reality show -- this is reality,"" Obama added, taking particular aim at Trump on the coronavirus crisis. ""Four years ago, you'd be tailgating here instead of watching a speech from your car.""

Obama's remarks will undoubtedly anger Trump, who has continued to attack his predecessor even after almost four years removed from his last day in office.

After Obama suggested Trump uses the presidency to boost his own profile, he added, ""Even then, his TV ratings are down. So you know that upsets him.""

And when he noted that Trump inherited a booming economy from him, Obama added, but ""just like everything else he inherited, he messed it up.""

""How is that possible? A secret Chinese bank account,"" Obama asked.

Then he reflected on the way that conservative media and Trump treated him during his time in office.

""Listen, can you imagine if I had had a secret Chinese bank account when I was running for reelection?"" Obama asked. ""You think Fox News might have been a little concerned about that? They would have called me Beijing Barry.""

Obama also touted Biden and his running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, throughout the speech, saying that while he didn't know Biden well when they both served in the Senate, he ""came to admire Joe as a man who has learned early on to treat everyone that he meets with dignity and respect.""

Obama said Biden would ""never call the men and women of our military suckers and losers,"" citing a bombshell report on Trump from The Atlantic. He said Trump has ""emboldened"" racists. Obama also incredulously recounted instances of Trump retweeting conspiracy theories, indirectly mentioning the false QAnon claim that says there is a ""secret cabal running the world.""

""It just won't be so exhausting,"" Obama said of a Biden administration, adding voters are ""not going to have to think about the crazy things ... and that is worth a lot.""

Back in the game

Obama, after largely sitting out the Democratic primary, has steadily ramped up his anti-Trump rhetoric, after years of trying to hew to a longstanding tradition that former presidents avoid attacking their successors. Trump, however, changed that calculation and Obama has ramped up his critiques of the President.

""Former presidents tend not to delve too deeply into politics and certainly not the politics of their successors,"" David Axelrod, a longtime adviser to Obama, said in an interview. ""I think that was his plan, but Trump changed that plan.""

Obama started his day on the campaign trail with a round table meeting at the Hank Gathers Youth Access Center in North Philadelphia, where he urged voters -- particularly the Black men in attendance -- to vote this year not because it will dramatically and immediately change their lives, but because it will take the country in the right direction.

Obama, who ran a dozen years ago with a focus on ""Hope and Change,"" said that while he remains hopeful about the future of the United States, the country ""can't afford another four years"" under Trump.

""With my election, I think we had probably gotten over-optimistic about how much change had happened in the country. But that change was real,"" Obama said. ""There was some pushback. And that was real, too.""

Obama then added: ""We can't afford another four years of this, because what happens is you do get to a point where you go so far backward that it becomes really hard to dig yourself out of that hole.""

Obama did not mention Trump by name during the roundtable, but he did offer a blistering critique of his successors handling of the coronavirus.

""The pandemic would've been tough for any president,"" Obama said. ""But the degree of incompetence and misinformation, the number of people who might not had died had we just done the basics, the degree to which it has impacted low income communities so disproportionally, that's something that I'm not just confident that it can be fixed, there's proof.""

Obama then stepped out of the community center and returned to his roots as a community organizer, the job that launched his political career, when he grabbed a bullhorn to give Democratic organizers a pep talk.

""Folks, seeing your effort out there is going to be inspiring. Don't be discouraged,"" Obama said through the bullhorn. ""You will get some folks who say I am not going to vote, you will get some folks who will be distracted ... but for this community to see all of you making this effort, that is the kind of spirit that is ultimately going to make a difference in this election.""

As much as Obama's appearance was a cathartic release for Democrats, he also offered a dose of tough medicine for them and warned against complacency.

""We've got to turn out like never before. We cannot leave any doubt in this election,"" Obama said, recalling the final days of the 2016 campaign. ""A whole bunch of people stayed at home and got lazy and complacent. Not this time. Not in this election.""

Throughout his evening address, muffled sounds of protests could be heard in the distance. Trump supporters gathered outside the grounds of the sports complex, where the Phillies, Flyers and Eagles play.

""We cannot afford four more years of this Philadelphia,"" Obama said. ""We can vote for change.""

WASHINGTON – Former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton will join President Joe Biden at Arlington National Cemetery for a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier after Biden's swearing-in next week.

Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will lay the wreath after they take the oath of office and conduct a Pass in Review inspection of the troops at the Capitol on Jan. 20, Biden’s inaugural committee announced Monday. The ceremony will be one of Biden’s first official acts as the new commander in chief.

The announcement that three former presidents will accompany Biden follows President Donald Trump’s announcement last week that he will skip Biden’s inauguration. Trump will be the first outgoing president in 152 years to refuse to attend his successor’s inauguration. Vice President Mike Pence will attend the swearing-in ceremony.

Former first ladies Michelle Obama, Laura Bush and Hillary Rodham Clinton also will attend the ceremony at Arlington.

The theme of Biden’s inauguration will be “America United,” the inaugural committee said.

“This inauguration marks a new chapter for the American people – one of healing, of unifying, of coming together, of an America united,” said Tony Allen, the committee’s chief executive officer. “It is time to turn the page on this era of division. The inaugural activities will reflect our shared values and serve as a reminder that we are stronger together than we are apart, just as our motto ‘e pluribus unum’ reminds us – ‘out of many, one.’ ”

As part of the inaugural events, a “Field of Flags” public art exhibition will be erected on the National Mall and include 191,500 U.S. flags of varying sizes, including flags representing every state and territory and 56 pillars of light.

This exhibit, which will cover the National Mall up to 13th Street, will represent the American people who are unable to travel to Washington for the inauguration, the inaugural committee said.

Biden's inauguration will be a scaled-down event because of the health risks posed by the coronavirus pandemic. Tickets to the swearing-in ceremony will be limited. The traditional parade down Pennsylvania Avenue will be replaced by a virtual parade that will be televised.

mjcmxy	obama	Obama congratulates MLB for 'taking a stand' against Georgia election law as Trump calls for boycott	"(CNN) Former Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump have weighed in on Major League Baseball's decision to move its All-Star Game out of Atlanta in response to Georgia's new sweeping election law that imposes significant new obstacles to voting.

Obama on Saturday congratulated the league ""for taking a stand on behalf of voting rights for all citizens,"" following MLB's Friday announcement. The Democrat's tweeted support of the move struck a starkly different tone from his Republican successor's statement late Friday that called for a boycott of baseball and all of the ""woke companies that are interfering with Free and Fair Elections.""

Opponents of the new election law say the legislation, and similar measures being considered in other states, amount to voter suppression efforts that will reduce minority voting. Republicans cast the measure, dubbed The Election Integrity Act of 2021, as necessary to boost confidence in elections after the 2020 election saw Trump make repeated, unsubstantiated claims of fraud.

The legislation, signed into law last month by Georgia GOP Gov. Brian Kemp, imposes voter identification requirements for absentee ballots, allows state officials to take over local elections boards, limits the use of ballot drop boxes and makes it a crime to give or offer voters food and drink as they wait in line to vote.

Georgia was key to President Joe Biden's victory over Trump in November, and Biden has called the bill ""Jim Crow in the 21st Century"" and ""an atrocity."" On Wednesday, he told ESPN -- before the MLB made its decision -- that he would ""strongly support"" moving the game out of Atlanta.

With its Friday announcement, MLB said it still plans to honor baseball legend and Hall of Famer Hank Aaron , who played for the Atlanta Braves, at the All-Star Game.

In his Saturday tweet praising the league's move, Obama added that ""there's no better way for America's pastime to honor the great Hank Aaron, who always led by example.""

MLB's decision to move the game comes as the tourism industry, one of the hardest hit during the Covid-19 pandemic, is still struggling to rebound.

A Cobb County tourism official estimated that the ""lost economic impact"" on the state from the MLB relocating its All-Star Game would be more than $100 million

Kemp blasted the MLB's decision during a Saturday news conference as caving to ""fear and lies from liberal activists"" and putting ""the wishes"" of Biden and Stacey Abrams, a Georgia Democrat and voting rights advocate, ""ahead of the economic well-being of hard-working Georgians who were counting on the All-Star Game for a paycheck.""

Atlanta's Democratic Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield on Saturday that the MLB's decision would likely be the ""first of many boycotts of our state to come"" and urged Republican state lawmakers, who passed the measure, to repeal it or make changes.

Bottoms told CNN that while she doesn't like MLB's decision to pull the game from her city, ""I certainly understand it,"" adding that ""it is hurting our economy and it's my hope that, finally, leaders across the state will listen.""

""Just as the legislators and the governor made the decision to go forward with this bill, people are making decisions not to come to our state. And it's going to impact millions of Georgians, employment, small businesses, our corporations, and it's very unfortunate,"" she said.

The new host city for the July 13 game has yet to be announced, according to the league.

l4ugvu	obama	Four years later, much of Obama's policy has survived Trump	"As President Trump prepares to leave office, more than 25 million Americans remain covered by the Affordable Care Act, which he tried to repeal; some 650,000 immigrants get the protections from deportation that he tried to rescind, and employment continues to shrink in the coal industry, which he promised to revive.

His four years in office have had a huge impact on American life — visible in the sharp increase in distrust of the nation’s democratic institutions and the rise of radical, white nationalist groups he winked at.

Trump’s administration has reopened large swaths of the country to mining and drilling, and sharply reduced environmental, safety and health regulations. The tax cut he signed into law, which tilted heavily toward upper-income Americans, helped widen the nation’s income inequality. And the 226 federal judges he appointed, including 54 to the federal courts of appeals and three to the Supreme Court, will push the judiciary in a conservative direction for years.

But his larger ambitions to uproot key domestic policies of President Obama largely failed. And now Obama’s vice president, Joe Biden, who is scheduled to take the oath of office at noon on Wednesday, will be able to build on the foundations that remain intact, starting with a wave of executive actions he’s expected to take Wednesday.

In a prerecorded farewell address that the White House released Tuesday afternoon, Trump said he “took on the tough battles, the hardest fights, the most difficult choices — because that’s what you elected me to do.” He claimed credit for having “built the greatest economy in the history of the world”— a significant exaggeration — and for “historic peace deals in the Middle East.”

He also extended “best wishes” to his successor, although he did not mention Biden by name in the 20-minute video. “This week, we inaugurate a new administration and pray for its success in keeping America safe and prosperous,” he said.

But while Trump touted his trade battles with China, the massive tax cut he signed in 2017 and other policy steps of the last four years, he made little mention of some of the largest legislative battles of his tenure, such as healthcare.

Resistance by congressional Democrats and outside groups helped prevent the administration from achieving success on that and other priorities, and Democrats have happily claimed credit.

Trump’s agenda “was stopped in its tracks by a formidable force that Trump didn’t bother to anticipate: Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi and the united Democratic House caucus,” said Pelosi’s spokesperson, Drew Hammill. “On issue after issue — including fighting for ‘Dreamers,’ LGBTQ Americans and women in the workplace — Speaker Pelosi and Democrats have held the line.”

Trump’s habit of losing interest after announcing sweeping plans and his administration’s lack of attention to the law also undermined his goals.

“They shot the moon and went for the maximum destructive outcomes,” said Jody Freeman, who was Obama’s advisor on climate change and now directs the environmental and energy law program at Harvard. “They also did it very badly.”

“The legal theories they relied on were deeply flawed,” she said. “A lot of the moves they made were careless legally. They lost a lot in court.”

On many of the efforts to uproot Obama’s agenda, Trump also suffered from divisions within his own party. The areas in which he had the greatest success largely enacted goals that “have long been the priorities of the Republican Party” — tax cuts and conservative judges, said Princeton University historian Sean Wilentz. On those topics, Trump largely adopted the party’s agenda, rather than the other way around.

By contrast, the unsuccessful effort to repeal Obamacare highlighted Republican divisions.

The repeal effort dominated much of the administration’s first seven months, ending in one of the signature images of Trump’s tenure — Sen. John McCain

(R-Ariz.), less than a week after surgery and his announcement that he had brain cancer, walking onto the Senate floor, pausing for dramatic effect, then turning thumbs-down to defeat the repeal bill.

The lengthy congressional debate on repeal increased public support for the healthcare law, and Republican efforts to dismantle it played a major role in Democrats’ winning a majority in the House in the 2018 midterm election and restoring Pelosi (D-San Francisco) to the speaker’s job.

Opposition to the law continued to decline this year during the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, Americans by 53% to 34% view the healthcare law favorably, according to polling by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.

“Not only did the ACA remain standing, you could make the argument that it’s stronger,” said Rahm Emanuel, who was Obama’s chief of staff.

After his initial defeat on repeal, Trump largely gave up his effort, except for one provision, the requirement that Americans purchase health insurance.

That individual mandate had never been enforced, but was the law’s least popular major element. Congress repealed it as part of the tax bill, allowing Trump to claim a symbolic victory. Despite worries by healthcare experts, however, the repeal had relatively little impact on the number of people covered.

Trump took other steps to impede the law, and by 2019 the number of uninsured Americans had started to creep back up.

But while “they certainly gummed up the works, and it will take time for the Biden people to undo,” in the long run “Trump’s impact on the healthcare system is not likely to be lasting,” said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for healthcare policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation.

“It’s hard to imagine a president who had such an enormous effect on the nation’s psyche and in some ways so little effect on policy,” he added.

The one exception, Levitt noted, would be if the Supreme Court were to rule in favor of a case brought by Texas and other conservative states that seeks to overturn the law. At oral arguments in November, however, the justices, including some of Trump’s appointees, sounded deeply skeptical of the conservative-backed lawsuit, which legal experts have rated as a long shot.

Trump’s actions on other key policy areas followed the pattern he set on healthcare: an initial flurry of action, limited follow-through often undermined by officials skirting the law, ending in failure.

The president sought, for example, to use the census to identify people in the country without legal status and to exclude them from the count.

The Supreme Court struck down the administration’s plan, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. writing in June 2019 that the legal rationale for its actions “seems to have been contrived.”

Trump tried a year later to achieve the same goal using an executive directive that told the Census Bureau to come up with a way to exclude residents in the country illegally from the data used for apportioning congressional and legislative districts. That effort also failed.

The final act came over the weekend as the Census Bureau’s director gave up on the effort to come up with the numbers Trump wanted and announced he would resign Wednesday, a year before his term normally would have expired.

Monday brought another major defeat for an administration priority — this one on climate change. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the administration’s effort to replace Obama-era rules for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from power plants with a watered-down alternative favored by fossil-fuel companies.

The ruling will clear the way for the Biden team to write its own rules, without having to go through the burdensome process of unwinding Trump policies, said Freeman, who called it one of the biggest losses the administration has endured in its four-year bid to deregulate the energy sector.

“Death by hubris” defined the administration’s efforts, she said. A more careful, measured approach might have made Biden’s job harder, but “they did not do what might have been strategically smarter.”

The same holds true for much — although not all — of what Trump tried to do on immigration, said John Sandweg, who was acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement under Obama.

“A lot of what he was trying to do is going to go away very quickly, a good chunk on Day One,” he said.

“On a temporary basis, he had a lot of success in making it harder on people trying to come to this country to live and work,” Sandweg said. In the process, administration policies “created a lot of damage on things like family separation,” he added.

But as with environmental policy, many of the administration’s more ambitious policies failed because courts ruled that officials had failed to follow the law.

“DACA is a great example,” Sandweg said, referring to the Obama administration policy that provides a shield against deportation to so-called Dreamers, young immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children. “They tried to get rid of it in such a ham-handed fashion” that the Supreme Court ruled against them in June, he said.

“I don’t want to suggest he completely failed,” he added. “There was a tremendous amount of damage, and the country is not in as good shape as it could have been because really talented people who wanted to live and work in the United States had to leave.

“But it could have been worse. DACA could have been eviscerated.”

kdr8mx	obama	President Barack Obama To Appear On ‘The Daily Show With Trevor Noah’	"President Barack Obama’s late-night tour continues with an appearance on Comedy Central’s The Daily Show with Trevor Noah.

Obama sat down with Noah to conduct an in-depth interview over the weekend and it will air on Tuesday December 15.

It is Obama’s latest appearance on Noah’s show, having appeared just before he left office in 2016.

Noah joked that the former Commander-in-Chief influenced people to run for high office, including Donald Trump and Kanye West. “I don’t know if you noticed, but you have an ability to inspire people to run for the highest office in the land with the jokes that you tell about them,” said the late-night host.

Obama responded, “I should roast people I admire more. I’ll start roasting you. Although you weren’t born here… but I was able to get away with it apparently.”

Obama, promoting his book A Promised Land, also admitted that he didn’t have any withdrawals about leaving office. “There are people I know who had them when they leave public life. Michelle and I, it’s something we share, we feel good about the work we did, we don’t feel anxiety about not being the center of attention. We get frustrated like citizens when we see something unjust or unfair… the goal for us is to find new ways to have that same impact,” he added.

It is President Obama’s latest late-night appearance in recent weeks. Last night, he featured on Desus & Mero and he has appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel Live!"	left

Looking straight into the camera, Obama said, “So much is at stake in this election, from getting the pandemic under control to building a fairer economy to taking on climate change to protecting our health care. You can change our direction on every issue. That’s the power of your vote.”

The state-specific videos included instructions for voters in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin. According to a press release sent out by the Democratic National Committee, more instructional videos for other states are set to be released.

During the 2020 campaigns, Democrats have routinely accused the GOP of engaging in voter suppression, while Republicans have in turn pushed the claim that widespread voter fraud exists, despite no evidence to suggest major voter fraud occurs in the U.S.

In states such as Texas, Democrats have called for more relaxed voting rules to be adopted in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

An unprecedented number of voters are expected to turn out this year, with more than 6.6 million Americans already voting last week, more than 10 times the number who had voted at the same time during the 2016 presidential election.

Michael McDonald of the University of Florida, which runs the United States Election Project, predicts that up to 150 million people could vote this year, 65 percent of eligible voters. This would be the highest percentage of voter turnout since 1908.

In 2016, about 58 percent of eligible voters turned out to vote, similar to the rate seen in the 2012 presidential election.

jsyl4d	obama	Obama memoir confronts role his presidency played in Republican obstructionism and Trump's rise	"Washington (CNN) Barack Obama directly confronts the racist politics of President Donald Trump in the first volume of his post-presidency memoir, bluntly suggesting how he believes his historic election in 2008 opened a wave of bitter and divisive turmoil that fueled Republicans' obstructionism and ultimately changed the party, according to a copy of the book obtained by CNN.

Here are the key revelations in Obama's new memoir

Here are the key revelations in Obama's new memoir 04:15

Here are the key revelations in Obama's new memoir

""It was as if my very presence in the White House had triggered a deep-seated panic, a sense that the natural order had been disrupted,"" Obama writes. ""Which is exactly what Donald Trump understood when he started peddling assertions that I had not been born in the United States and was thus an illegitimate president. For millions of Americans spooked by a Black man in the White House, he promised an elixir for their racial anxiety."" The 768-page memoir, titled A Promised Land and due out on November 17, chronicles the future president's childhood and political rise, before diving deeply into his historic 2008 campaign and first four years in office. Obama dedicates hundreds of pages to the fights and characters that colored his tenure, from his work to pass Obamacare in 2010 to the complexities of dealing with a slate of world leaders and finally his decision to approve the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.

President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and members of the national security team receive an update on the mission against Osama bin Laden in the Situation Room of the White House May 1, 2011 in Washington, DC.

But some of his most thoughtful examination comes at the expense of the party that opposed him and how it evolved during his eight years in office, starting with the elevation of Sarah Palin to the Republican presidential ticket in 2008. ""Through Palin, it seemed as if the dark spirits that had long been lurking on the edges of the modern Republican Party -- xenophobia, anti intellectualism, paranoid conspiracy theories, an antipathy toward Black and brown folks -- were finding their way to center stage,"" Obama writes

Throughout, Obama casts his presidency as comprised of hard choices, sometimes made more difficult by internal disputes, mismanagement by the previous administration and obstructionism by Republicans, which he suggests was rooted in an attempt to appeal to anxieties about the first Black president.

Yet he also acknowledges his own shortcomings on a range of topics, like calling his failure to pass immigration reform ""a bitter pill to swallow"" and acknowledging that the economy ""stank"" as he headed into the 2010 midterms, where Republicans reclaimed the House of Representatives on the back of the Tea Party movement.

""As far as I was concerned, the election didn't prove our agenda had been wrong,"" Obama writes of 2010. ""It just proved that... I'd failed to rally the nation, as FDR had once done, behind what I knew to be right. Which to me was just as damning.""

The timeliest reflections, however, come when Obama delves into the politics of Washington, particularly the work he put into negotiations with Republicans like Republican leader Sen. Mitch McConnell and then House Speaker John Boehner. But that introspection also offers a window into how Obama saw the opposing party change from his 2008 campaign to when he handed over the White House to Trump in 2017.

Obama writes that he ""wonder(s) sometimes"" about whether 2008 Republican nominee John McCain would still have picked Palin if he had known ""her spectacular rise and her validation as a candidate would provide a template for future politicians, shifting his party's center and the country's politics overall in a direction he abhorred.""

""I'd like to think that given the chance to do it over again, he might have chosen differently,"" Obama writes. ""I believe he really did put his country first.""

During an interview with CBS' Scott Pelley that aired Sunday evening on ""60 Minutes,"" Obama said he titled the book ""A Promised Land"" because ""even though we may not get there in our lifetimes, even if -- we experience hardships and disappointments along the way -- that I at least still have faith we can create a more perfect union.""

""Not a perfect union, but a more perfect union,"" he said.

""We're better than this""

Obama's views of his successor come through clearest in his recounting of the period in 2011 when Trump was fanning the racist lie that Obama was not born in the United States.

Trump's antics were seen initially in the White House as a joke. But Obama writes he came to regard Trump's media ubiquity and characteristic shamelessness as merely an exaggerated version of the Republican Party's attempts to appeal to White Americans' anxieties about the first Black president -- a sentiment he said ""had migrated from the fringe of GOP politics to the center -- an emotional, almost visceral, reaction to my presidency, distinct from any differences in policy or ideology.

Trump, who Obama said phoned the White House in 2010 to offer his assistance helping plug an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico (he was turned down), had determined that saying or behaving in ways previously seen as distasteful or unacceptable now earned him constant media attention.

""In that sense, there wasn't much difference between Trump and Boehner or McConnell. They, too, understood that it didn't matter whether what they said was true,"" he writes, adding: ""In fact, the only difference between Trump's style of politics and theirs was Trump's lack of inhibition.""

When Obama, against the advice of his advisers, released his long-form birth certificate during an appearance in the White House briefing room, he said he told young staffers afterward: ""We're better than this.""

'I could trust him. I wouldn't be disappointed'

Obama's views on the changing Republican Party are infused into all aspects of the book. When the former president writes about his trip to India in 2010 , he links the themes of rising illiberalism in a conversation with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to the rise of the Tea Party in the United States.

Barack Obama and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh (L) toast during a banquet in New Delhi on November 8, 2010.

Domestically, too, Obama writes that the more confrontational Republican Party impacted some of the day-to-day decisions he made as president, especially when it came to dispatching then vice president Joe Biden, now the President-elect, to Capitol Hill to negotiate on his behalf.

""One of the reasons I'd chosen Joe to act as an intermediary -- in addition to his Senate experience and legislative acumen -- was my awareness that in McConnell's mind, negotiations with the vice president didn't inflame the Republican base in quite the same way that any appearance of cooperation with (Black, Muslim socialist) Obama was bound to do,"" Obama writes.

The Obama tome has been a long time coming, the length confounding even close aides who marveled as the former president wrote -- freehand -- on scores of yellow legal pads. Obama himself admits that the writing process ""didn't go exactly was planned,"" evident by the fact that the book has been separated in two volumes and that it was delayed.

This is Obama's third memoir -- the first was ""Dream from My Father"" in 1995 and his second was ""The Audacity of Hope"" in 2006. Michelle Obama released her own memoir, ""Becoming,"" in 2018, selling millions of copies in under a year.

The Obamas together were reportedly paid a $65 million advance for their memoirs by Penguin Random House.

Despite writing the book before the 2020 election, there are clear echoes between the moments Obama describes and this current moment of political upheaval, especially when the former president describes his interactions with Biden, the President-elect.

President Barack Obama speaks to the National Conference of State Legislatures as U.S. Vice President Joseph Biden looks on in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building of the White House on March 20, 2009 in Washington, DC.

Obama recalls how Biden would offer differing opinions to many of his advisers, like when he was skeptical about the United States War in Afghanistan, leading other members of the Cabinet, like Defense Secretary Robert Gates, to consider Biden a naysayer. And how Biden would raise questions about how actions at the White House could impact Democrats in Congress.

The most detailed recollections of the Obama-Biden relationship came when the former president described picking Biden as his running mate.

""I liked the fact that Joe would be more than ready to serve as president if something happened to me -- and that it might reassure those who still worried I was too young,"" Obama wrote. ""What mattered most, though, was what my gut told me -- that Joe was decent, honest, and loyal. I believed that he cared about ordinary people, and that when things got tough, I could trust him. I wouldn't be disappointed.""

The memoir also details Obama's relationship with his predecessor, former President George W. Bush, who welcomed him during the presidential transition despite the fact that Obama ran, in part, on a rejection of the Republican president during his 2008 campaign. The book's release comes as Trump is fighting the results of the 2020 election and making the transition difficult for Biden, his successor.

""Whether because of his respect for the institution, lessons from his father, bad memories of his own transition... or just basic decency, President Bush would end up doing all he could to make the 11 weeks between my election and his departure go smoothly,"" Obama wrote, including noting that the Bush daughters, Barbara and Jenna, ""rearranged their schedules to give Malia and Sasha their own tour.""

""I promised myself that when the time came, I would treat my successor the same way,"" Obama said, a nod to his transition with Trump.

Assessing Trump's behavior since CNN and other news outlets projected the presidential race for Biden, Obama told Pelley: ""Well, a president is a public servant. They are temporary occupants of the office, by design.""

""And when your time is up then it is your job to put the country first and think beyond your own ego, and your own interests, and your own disappointments,"" he said.

""My advice to President Trump is, if you want at this late stage in the game to be remembered as somebody who put country first, it's time for you to do the same thing.""

""Friends as well as lovers""

While the book spends considerable time on some of the heaviest moments of Obama's presidency, it also delves into lighter moments like Obama's childhood -- he describes himself as an ""incessant, dedicated partyer"" -- and his early love life, like how he used intellectual curiosity to impress the ""various women I was attempting to get to know.""

""As a strategy for picking up girls, my pseudo-intellectualism proved mostly worthless,"" he writes. ""I found myself in a series of affectionate but chaste friendships.""

He writes, somewhat lightheartedly, about how the stress of the White House led to his bad tendencies, like smoking, noting that he would sometimes smoke eight or nine or ten cigarettes a day and look for a ""discreet location to grab an evening smoke."" He said he quit smoking by ""ceaselessly"" chewing nicotine gum after his daughter Malia ""frowned"" after ""smelling a cigarette on my breath.""

Obama explores his marriage to Michelle Obama throughout the book, recalling when they ""became friends as well as lovers"" and describing her as an ""original.""

But there are passages throughout the book that exemplify the toll a life in politics, especially in the White House, can take on a marriage.

""And yet, despite Michelle's success and popularity, I continued to sense an undercurrent of tension in her, subtle but constant, like the faint thrum of a hidden machine,"" Obama writes about his marriage. ""It was as if, confined as we were within the walls of the White House, all her previous sources of frustration became more concentrated, more vivid, whether it was my round the clock absorption with work, or the way politics exposed our family to scrutiny and attacks, or the tendency of even friends and family members to treat her role as secondary in importance.""

Obama adds that there were nights ""lying next to Michelle in the dark, I'd think about those days when everything between us felt lighter, when her smile was more constant and our love less encumbered, and my heart would suddenly tighten at the thought that those days might not return.""

'They're scared of you'

The most personal and powerful recollections come, however, when race intersects with Obama's reflections, particularly when the former president recalls how, in high school, he would ask why ""Blacks play professional basketball but not coach it"" and what it meant when ""that girl from school mean when she said she didn't think of me as Black.""

It wasn't until his time in Chicago as a community organizer that he ""resolved the lingering questions of my racial identity,"" Obama writes, adding that the years under Harold Washington, Chicago's first black mayor, that made him ""think for the first time that I wanted to someday run for public office.""

But even in Chicago, Obama writes, questions about his race would linger. When he unsuccessfully ran against Rep. Bobby Rush in 2000, Obama notes that some asked the question, ""Is he even black?""

The most powerful self-examinations about race come during Obama's years in the White House, though.

When describing his decision to criticize the arrest of Henry Louis Gates in 2009, Obama recalls how then White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs asked if he would consider clarifying his statement. Obama writes that he told his top aide it will ""blow over,"" but he was wrong, learning later from his polling director that the incident caused a huge drop in support among white voters that he never recovered.

""The reaction to my comments on Gates surprised us all,"" Obama writes. ""It was my first indicator of how the issue of Black folks and the police was more polarizing than just about any other subject in American life.""

Those feelings just continued during the rise of Palin and the Tea Party, Obama writes, recalling how Michelle Obama ""caught a glimpse of a Tea Party rally on TV.""

""She seized the remote and turned off the set, her expression hovering somewhere between rage and resignation,"" Obama writes. ""'It's a trip, isn't it?' she said. ... 'That they're scared of you. Scared of us.'""

In recent weeks, the Trump administration has been under fire for a myriad of missteps and dangerous messaging after the death of George Floyd and the mishandling of nationwide protests against systemic racism and police brutality. After briefly addressing Floyd’s death, Trump made a spectacle of himself by tear-gassing and shooting rubber bullets into a crowd of peaceful protests for a photo op in front of a church with a Bible.

Trump’s inability to bring comfort and hope to a country clearly divided was also on display this week as he rolled back patient protections for transgender people in a set of policies designed to impact their health care, education, and employment opportunities.

It makes sense, especially now, that the world is looking for positive images that inspire hope. For many, this is the embodiment of Barack Obama.

As reported by Fox News, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Monday that Biden is in ""regular"" communication with the former head of state.

""They consult and talk about a range of issues and I would expect that continues through the course of President Biden’s presidency,"" she said."	left

""In January 2011, as the new Republican House majority was settling in and I was getting adjusted to the Speakership, I was asked about the birth certificate business by Brian Williams of NBC News. My answer was simple: 'The state of Hawaii has said that President Obama was born there. That’s good enough for me,' "" Boehner wrote in an essay adapted from his book that was published Friday by Politico Magazine.

The former speaker called his assertion at the time ""a simple statement of fact,"" but quipped ""you would have thought I’d called Ronald Reagan a communist.""

""I got all kinds of shit for it—emails, letters, phone calls. It went on for a couple weeks. I knew we would hear from some of the crazies, but I was surprised at just how many there really were,"" Boehner said in the essay. ""All of this crap swirling around was going to make it tough for me to cut any deals with Obama as the new House Speaker. Of course, it has to be said that Obama didn’t help himself much either.""

During Obama's first term in office, prominent critics on Capitol Hill and some in conservative media suggested he had not been born in America.

Boehner's essay does not mention another appearance he had at the time discussing Obama's birthplace.

During an appearance on NBC's “Meet The Press” shortly after the Brian Williams interview, Boehner was pressed on questions about Obama's citizenship.

He said that he was not going to tell voters what they should believe about where Obama was born, saying, ""It's not my job to tell the American people what to think.""

""The president says he's a Christian. I accept him at his word,"" the speaker said at the time, adding, ""I've made clear what I think the facts are.""

Boehner served as the Republican House leader during the rise of the Freedom Caucus and Tea Party and added that he thought Obama could, at times, come off as ""lecturing and haughty"" and bemoaned that at no time during his presidency did he make outreach to Republicans a priority.

""But on the other hand — how do you find common cause with people who think you are a secret Kenyan Muslim traitor to America?""

Boehner also lamented in the essay what he characterized as a radicalization of the Republican Party in the age of Trump.

""Ronald Reagan used to say something to the effect that if I get 80 or 90 percent of what I want, that’s a win,"" he wrote. ""These guys wanted 100 percent every time. In fact, I don’t think that would satisfy them, because they didn’t really want legislative victories. They wanted wedge issues and conspiracies and crusades."""	left
mdu2sg	obama	Biden agrees with Obama that the Senate filibuster is a 'Jim Crow relic' and says it's being 'abused in a gigantic way'	"President Biden said he agreed with former President Obama that the filibuster is a ""Jim Crow relic.""

Biden inched closer to endorsing efforts to abolish the rule requiring 60 votes to pass legislation.

Democrats don't have the required 50 ""yes"" votes to abolish the rule in Senate.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

President Joe Biden said he agreed with former President Barack Obama that the Senate filibuster is a ""Jim Crow relic"" and inched closer to endorsing Democratic efforts to abolish the rule requiring 60 votes to pass legislation during a Thursday press conference.

Biden said the filibuster is being ""abused in a gigantic way"" and again threw his support behind reverting to a ""talking filibuster,"" which would make it more challenging for senators to block legislation.

""I strongly support moving in that direction,"" Biden said.

Obama said during his eulogy for Rep. John Lewis in July 2020 that he supports eliminating the filibuster, if necessary, to restore the Voting Rights Act of 1964 and pass other civil rights legislation. The filibuster was often used by segregationist senators to block civil-rights legislation during and after the civil rights movement.

Biden was asked multiple questions about the filibuster during his first-ever formal press conference as president. The rule is threatening to sink some of the Biden administration and Democrats' biggest legislative efforts, including on infrastructure, immigration reform, and gun regulations, as the Senate is divided 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats.

While a majority of Democratic senators have coalesced around ending the Senate filibuster in recent months, the party doesn't have 50 ""yes"" votes to abolish the rule. Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema have both said they won't vote to end the rule.

Biden hasn't always been critical of the filibuster. While he was a senator, he argued that the rule as designed to foster bipartisanship.

""At its core, the filibuster is not about stopping a nominee or a bill, it is about compromise and moderation,"" he said during a 2005 speech. ""That is why the Founders put unlimited debate in. That is what it is about, engendering compromise and moderation."""	left
m2x17v	obama	Former Presidents Carter, Clinton, Bush and Obama and first ladies unite to urge Americans to get vaccinated	"The exclusive club of former presidents and first ladies has reunited with an important message: Get the COVID-19 vaccine. Missing from the campaign is former President Donald Trump and former first lady Melania Trump.

In the newly released ""It's Up To You"" ad campaign, former presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and former first ladies Rosalynn Carter, Hillary Clinton, Laura Bush and Michelle Obama, are emphasizing the importance of Americans getting the vaccine as soon as they are eligible.

There are two ads in the new campaign. One shows the former presidents and first ladies receiving their vaccines and sharing personal anecdotes, and another features Mr. Clinton, Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama standing together in a direct address to the American people.

""Soon they will be available to everyone,"" Mr. Bush says of the vaccine at the beginning of the first ad.

""This vaccine means hope,"" Mr. Obama says next. ""It will protect you and those you love from this dangerous and deadly disease.""

Mr. Clinton says he wants to go back to work, Mr. Obama discusses being able to hug Michelle's mother and see her on her birthday and Mr. Bush shares his excitement for attending Opening Day at Texas Rangers Stadium — at full capacity.

""I'm getting vaccinated because we want this pandemic to end as soon as possible,"" Mr. Carter says, although he does not appear on video.

The ad ends with images of the former presidents and first ladies receiving their shots, concluding with a smiling photo of Mr. Carter holding his vaccine card.

The second ad features Mr. Bush, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Obama standing together at Memorial Amphitheater at Arlington National Ceremony. The three former presidents united at Arlington on January 20 to mark President Biden's inauguration.

""The science is clear, these vaccines will protect you and those you love from this dangerous and deadly disease,"" Mr. Bush says. ""So, we urge you to get vaccinated when it is available to you.""

""They could save your life,"" Mr. Clinton adds.

""That's the first step to ending the pandemic and moving our country forward,"" Mr. Obama says. ""It's up to you.""

Mr. Trump and his wife did not participate in the campaign. Both received the coronavirus vaccine in January, but did not reveal they were vaccinated until weeks after leaving the White House.

The public service announcements come just in time for the one-year anniversary of the World Health Organization declaring COVID-19 a global pandemic.

Hesitancy to get the vaccine remains a critical issue in the U.S., as the Biden administration ramps up its efforts to vaccinate 100 million Americans in President Biden's first 100 days in office. Mr. Biden will deliver a first primetime address to the nation Thursday night, marking the pandemic's anniversary.

More than 525,000 Americans have died due to COVID-19, according to Johns Hopkins University.

More than 93.7 million vaccine doses have been administered as of Tuesday and 123.2 million shots have been delivered, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 32 million Americans are fully vaccinated, and the U.S. is now averaging more than 2 million shots administered per day.

Emergency-use authorizations have so far been approved for the two-shot Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines and the single dose Johnson & Johnson shot."	left
kr4wbg	obama	Obama warns of threats to 'fundamental principles of our democracy' after Trump Georgia call	"Former President Obama on Monday warned of threats to the “fundamental principles of our democracy,” a day after leaked audio of President Trump Donald TrumpCaitlyn Jenner says election was not 'stolen,' calls Biden 'our president' Overnight Health Care: FDA authorizes Pfizer vaccine for adolescents | Biden administration reverses limits on LGBTQ health protections Overnight Defense: US fires 30 warning shots at Iranian boats | Kabul attack heightens fears of Afghan women's fates | Democratic Party leaders push Biden on rejoining Iran deal MORE pressuring Georgia's top election official to find 11,000 votes to overturn the election in his favor.

“Tomorrow is Election Day in Georgia and the stakes could not be higher. We’re seeing how far some will go to retain power and threaten the fundamental principles of our democracy,” Obama, who has been campaigning in recent weeks to help bolster the two Democratic candidates in Tuesday's Senate runoff elections, wrote in the first of a series of tweets.

“But our democracy isn’t about any individual, even a president—it’s about you,” he wrote before urging Georgia residents to utilize their “most powerful tool” as Americans and vote on Tuesday.

Obama did not mention Trump by name.

His comments come as Trump faces criticism on both sides of the aisle for telling Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) in a call on Saturday that he should “find” the “11,780 votes” needed to reverse his defeat in Georgia.

Audio of the call, which lasts about an hour, was published by The Washington Post on Sunday after the president tweeted about a call with Raffensperger earlier in the day.

Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.), one of a number of Republicans who have criticized Trump over the call, told The Hill that he thinks it was “wrong to go to a secretary of state” and ask him to find votes.

“We work our butts off to win elections; after the election we play fair and square,” he said.

In a recent interview discussing the call, Raffensperger said the audio would not have been released if the president didn't tweet “something that was false.”

“But he’s the one that couldn’t — you know, had to put it out on Twitter. And so, if you’re going to put out stuff that we don’t believe is true, then we will respond in kind,” Raffensperger added.

Trump has repeatedly criticized Raffensperger over the election in Georgia, which went blue in a presidential race for the first time in decades.

Tuesday's runoff elections will determine control of the Senate for the next two years. Republicans need to win just one of the two races to keep their majority."	left
k5ljvt	obama	Obama: I will take Covid vaccine if Fauci says it's safe	"He continued: “I promise you that when it’s been made for people who are less at risk, I will be taking it. I may end up taking it on TV or having it filmed, just so that people know that I trust this science.”

Obama said he was cognizant of suspicion in the African American community toward the rapidly developed vaccines, particularly considering the country’s history of medical malfeasance and abuse. He cited the Tuskegee syphilis study, in which federal medical researchers observed impoverished Black men with syphilis for 40 years without notifying them of their diagnoses and withholding treatment.

But Obama urged people of color to take the vaccine if it is approved and dubbed safe, noting the higher rates of infection and death among Latino, Indigenous and Black Americans.

The global coronavirus pandemic has led to an unprecedented race to develop effective vaccines — processes that generally take years. Pfizer, whose vaccine is slated to go under consideration by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this month, is already shipping out doses to distribution sites to be available immediately should it be granted authorization.

More than 13 million Americans have been infected by the disease and over 272,000 have died."	left
jlpbaj	obama	Obama: Trump cares about his ego, Biden cares about 'keeping your family safe'	"Flint, Michigan (CNN) Barack Obama assumed the role of Joe Biden's character witness on Saturday in Michigan, contrasting his one-time vice president's ""decency and empathy"" with President Donald Trump's focus on ""feeding his ego"" amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

The two events Obama headlined in predominantly Black cities -- first in Flint, Michigan, and later in Detroit -- looked to drive home the point that Democrats can't take this election for granted after depressed turnout four years earlier doomed Hillary Clinton in the state. Obama used both events, the first time the duo has been on stage together with either one of them on a presidential ticket since 2012, to focus on Biden's character, using it to draw a stark contrast to Trump.

Obama's remarks included blistering rebukes of Trump -- including mocking his focus on crowd sizes and belittling his economic achievements -- but the events stood out from earlier Obama appearances because of the way the former President touted Biden's character.

""Joe Biden is my brother. I love Joe Biden. And he will be a great president,"" Obama said in Flint, noting that while he didn't know Biden well when he selected him to be his running mate, he learned quickly that Biden treated everyone with ""dignity and with respect.""

""That sense of decency and empathy, the belief in hard work and family and faith, the belief that everyone counts, that is who Joe is and that is who he will be as president,"" Obama said, adding that Biden ""made me a better president.""

""He has got the character and the experience to make us a better country,"" Obama added. ""And he and Kamala (Harris) are going to be in the fight, not for themselves, but for every single one of us. And we sure can't say that about the President we have got right now.""

Obama then turned his focus to Trump in both events, lambasting the President for baselessly claiming at a recent event that doctors are inflating the coronavirus death count for monetary gain.

""Now he is accusing doctors of profiting off this pandemic. Think about that,"" Obama said incredulously. ""He cannot fathom, he does not understand the notion that somebody would risk his life to save others without trying to make a buck.""

In Detroit, Obama even provided a call back to his reelection bid, citing his oft used talking point that Republicans wanted to let ""Detroit go bankrupt"" during the economic downturn in 2009.

""You remember when Republicans were saying, 'Let Detroit go bankrupt?' You remember that,"" Obama asked. ""Now they might as well just be saying, 'Let America get Covid. It is not our problem. You are exaggerating it.' That is what they are literally saying every day.""

Obama also got personal when questioning why Trump was so fixated on the size of the crowds at his events.

""Does he have nothing better to worry about? Did no one come to his birthday party when he was a kid? Was he traumatized,"" Obama asked. ""What is with crowds?""

Those mocking lines were central to Obama's argument against Trump and for Biden.

""You know when a country is going through a pandemic that's not what you're supposed to be worrying about,"" Obama said in Flint. ""And that's the difference between Joe Biden and Trump right there. Trump cares about feeding his ego. Joe cares about keeping you and your family safe. And he's less interested in feeding his ego with having big crowds than he is making sure he's not going around making more and more people sick. That's what you should expect from a president.""

The location of their first joint appearance underscored the central question looming for Democrats: Will the voters who did not turn out for Hillary Clinton cast a ballot for Biden?

Crowds of people waved signs and cheered along the roadside on a sunny Saturday afternoon as Obama and Biden arrived at their drive-in rally in Flint, which is in Genesee County. Four years ago, Hillary Clinton received 26,000 fewer votes there than Obama and Biden did in 2012.

The second rally on Saturday for Obama and Biden in Detroit is part of Wayne County, where the falloff among voters was even more dramatic. Clinton received 75,000 fewer votes there than the Democratic ticket did in 2012.

Taken together, the two counties alone represented 100,000 fewer votes in 2016 for Democrats. Trump carried Michigan by 10,704 votes.

""We can't afford to be complacent,"" Obama said. ""Not this time. Not in this election. We got a little complacent in the last election.""

Horns honked loudly in the parking lot as Obama implored Michigan voters to ""turn out here like never before."" He asked people to ""imagine if 60% of us voted, if 70% of us voted?""

The coronavirus pandemic has dramatically upended the presidential race, with Democrats turning their campaign into a virtual one. Democratic officials don't question the decision, but say they do worry whether the lack of a traditional field program could fail to turn out Biden votes in the margins that they may need.

When Biden took the stage, he nodded to the fact that just hearing the former president speak could be cathartic for Democrats.

""Kind of reminds you how good it can be listening to him, doesn't it,"" Biden quipped.

The former vice president went on to echo Obama's remarks, especially when he slammed Trump in stark terms for falsely suggesting doctors make more money when coronavirus numbers are higher.

""He suggested falsely that they're inflating the number of Covid deaths to make more money,"" Biden said. ""What in the hell is wrong with this man? Excuse my language, but think about it. It's perverted.""

Biden added, ""He may believe it because he doesn't do anything other than for money. The people of this nation have suffered and sacrificed for nine months, none more so than the doctors on the front lines and health care workers, and this president is questioning their character? Their integrity? Their commitment to their fellow Americans? It's more than offensive, it's a disgrace.""

Obama has been one of Biden's most forceful defenders on the campaign trail, using a series of events this month to lay into Trump as ill-prepared for and uninterested in the presidency. Obama has also routinely touted Biden as the right man for the presidency at this moment of crisis, when the coronavirus is continuing to spread and the economy is rattled.

Obama's most pointed critiques of Trump this month have focused on the coronavirus and that continued on Saturday in Michigan.

""What's his closing argument? That people are too focused on Covid. He said this at one of his rallies. Covid, Covid, Covid, he's complaining,"" Obama said in Florida this week. ""He's jealous of Covid's media coverage. If he had been focused on Covid from the beginning, cases wouldn't be reaching new record highs across the country this week.""

On Saturday, Obama cast the election as critical for the future of the country. The former President noted that his speech was happening during the Michigan-Michigan State Football game, a heated rivalry where the Paul Bunyan Trophy was ""on the line.""

""But this Tuesday,"" Obama said. ""Everything is on the line.""

mcb63f	obama	Obama: We can't rely on a 'once-in-a-century pandemic' to slow mass shootings	"Former President Barack Obama joined a chorus of Democratic voices Tuesday calling for reforms to the nation’s gun laws after a mass shooting in Boulder, Colo., left 10 people dead.

“It is long past time for those with the power to fight this epidemic of gun violence to do so,” Obama said in a statement. “It will take time to root out the disaffection, racism and misogyny that fuels so many of these senseless acts of violence. But we can make it harder for those with hate in their hearts to buy weapons of war. We can overcome opposition by cowardly politicians and the pressure of a gun lobby that opposes any limit on the ability of anyone to assemble an arsenal. We can, and we must.”

The massacre in Boulder came less than a week after shootings at three spas in the Atlanta area left eight people dead. They followed a documented lull in mass killings caused, in part, by pandemic lockdowns, according to a database compiled by the Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University.

“A once-in-a-century pandemic cannot be the only thing that slows mass shootings in this country,” Obama said. “We shouldn’t have to choose between one type of tragedy and another. It’s time for leaders everywhere to listen to the American people when they say enough is enough — because this is a normal we can no longer afford.”

At the White House, President Biden called on Congress to act on gun control measures — including a ban on assault weapons.

“I don't need to wait another minute — or another hour — to take common sense steps that will save lives in the future,” Biden said.

“This shouldn’t be a bipartisan issue. This is an American issue that will save lives — American lives. And we have to act.”

Obama failed to get Congress to pass meaningful gun reforms during his two terms in office, despite repeated mass shootings.

The former president has often called the day he met with the families of 26 people — including 20 children — who were killed in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 “the toughest day of my presidency.”

And he considers the failure of Congress to pass gun control legislation in the wake of the massacre one of his biggest disappointments.

“Every time I think about those kids, it makes me mad,” Obama said at a press conference in January 2016, toward the end of his presidency.

l8rcht	obama	St. Petersburg’s main library now ‘President Barack Obama’ library	"ST. PETERSBURG — Almost three years ago, during February — Black History Month — 2018, Mayor Rick Kriseman stood in front of St. Petersburg’s main library on 9th Avenue N and declared it would get a new name.

The library, which also needed renovations, would honor America’s first African American president, Barack Obama.

Friday, on the cusp of Black History Month, it happened: a sign that said “President Barack Obama Main Library” adorned with the city’s rainbow pelican arrived at the facility on a flatbed.

The installation at the library, located at 3745 9th Ave. N, was meant to again coincide with Black History Month, which begins on Monday. Kriseman spokesman Ben Kirby said an unveiling ceremony for the new sign and name will take place next month.

The new name accompanies a $6 million renovation of the 55-year-old facility funded by Penny for Pinellas sales tax revenue, which includes adding parking spaces, ADA-compliant restrooms, asbestos abatement, fire protection, HVAC improvements, an upgraded rear patio and outdoor gathering space, and reconfiguration of interior spaces with new programming areas.

The initial plan was to install the sign at the completion of the renovations, which haven’t yet begun because the Penny money wasn’t available until 2020. Instead, the sign will kick off the renovations.

“We have the sign, and rather than have the sign sit in storage until renovations are done, we decided to go ahead and install it now,” Kirby said.

k4r0u2	obama	Barack Obama stumps for Jon Ossoff in new TV ad	"(CNN) Former President Barack Obama is prominently featured in a new television ad for Georgia Democratic Senate candidate Jon Ossoff, pitching him as an injustice-fighting crusader who will pass a new Voting Rights Act and ""listen to the experts"" in combating the coronavirus pandemic.

The ad is a clear appeal to motivate Black voters, a crucial voting bloc in Georgia which dropped off in a 2008 Senate runoff race once Obama was off the ballot. The ad shows footage of Obama at a November 2 rally in Atlanta, where the former President noted that Ossoff ""learned about public service from one of my lifelong heroes,"" the late Georgia Congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis, who hired Ossoff as an intern.

""If we vote like our lives depend on it, because they do, we will elect Jon Osoff to the United States Senate,"" says Obama.

mlh3j8	obama	Obama praises programs that stopped sending police to most mental health crises	"Former President Obama tweeted his support Monday for programs that provide a non-law enforcement response to Americans experiencing mental health crises.

In a pair of tweets, the former president wrote that the programs were a ""promising development"" following 2020's summer of protests in response to the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other Black Americans killed by police.

Though Floyd's and Taylor's deaths weren't related to mental health checks, the protests inspired a wider debate about policing in American, including whether police should be the ones responding to mental health crises.

""More places are experimenting with programs that send civilian responders instead of police to help people experiencing mental health crises. It’s a promising development in law enforcement in the wake of this summer’s protests,"" Obama wrote.

Read about other developments from communities working together to reimagine policing in our recent @MBK_Alliance report. https://t.co/kLBjeG9iPQ — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) April 5, 2021

Obama linked to a USA Today story highlighting several cities that have launched or are piloting programs that send mental health counselors rather than police officers to conduct mental health checks, including Eugene, Ore.; Olympia, Wash.; and and Denver.

The story noted a 2016 study published in the American Journal of Preventative Medicine that estimated as many as half of fatal encounters with police involve someone with a mental illness. And a Washington Post database of fatal shootings by on-duty officers shows that about 25 percent of people fatally shot by police since 2015 had a mental illness.

gvdhyk	obama	Conservative: I'd take Obama over Trump in an instant, especially after the day we just had — From a conservative standpoint, Barack Obama was not an ideal president. But he was decent, honorable and patriotic. Donald Trump is none of these things.	"Conservative: I'd take Obama over Trump in an instant, especially after the day we just had Criticizing Obama was like calling fouls in a basketball game. Criticizing Trump is like calling 911 to report a crime spree. There's no comparison.

The contrast between the 44th and 45th presidents in a single day could not have been more dramatic. Barack Obama on Monday published a carefully reasoned article about police violence and mob violence, advising his fellow Americans how to restore peace and justice. Donald Trump, meanwhile, ranted at the nation’s governors by phone. He said most of them were “weak” and urged them to use the military to “dominate” the protesters.

Like other conservatives, I voted for John McCain and Mitt Romney and I criticized President Obama. But if I had to choose between him and his successor, I’d take Obama in a nanosecond.

The two presidencies are not even in the same category. Criticizing Obama was like calling fouls in a basketball game. Criticizing Trump is like calling 911 to report a crime spree.

I did fault Obama for raising expectations that he could not meet. Early in the 2008 campaign, he buttressed his support for campaign reform by pledging to stay within the public financing system for the general election. He then backtracked and instead relied on private contributions. The reversal was mildly embarrassing but totally lawful.

Trump horror show is unfolding now

By contrast, Robert Mueller’s report found that Trump’s 2016 campaign “expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.” In preparation for the 2020 campaign, Trump pressured the government of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden — the offense for which the House impeached him.

When Obama took office, his first major initiative was an economic stimulus package that would purportedly support “shovel-ready projects.” After the results fell short, he acknowledged, “there’s no such thing as shovel-ready projects.” He also promised that the Affordable Care Act would enable all Americans to keep the doctors and insurance plans that they liked. It did not work out that way.

On these issues and others, there was plenty of room for legitimate fault-finding. But Obama was hardly the first politician to over-promise and under-deliver. His policies did not amount to a revolution, but they were not a horror show, either.

The horror show is unfolding before us. Despite repeated warnings from his own administration and outside experts, Trump wasted precious time dismissing the coronavirus pandemic. “And again, when you have 15 people,” he said Feb. 26, ""and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that's a pretty good job we've done.” He said the next day: “It’s going to disappear. One day — it’s like a miracle — it will disappear.” More than 100,000 deaths later, these false assurances sound ghastly.

Keep Trump on Twitter: Each indefensible tweet is a reminder of the stakes this fall.

Critics like me enjoyed flyspecking Obama’s factual inaccuracies. In 2010, for example, I noted that he had misstated the scope of Social Security coverage in the 1930s. Such an error is a microscopic droplet in comparison with the flood of falsehoods gushing from the White House today. By one count, Trump made more than 19,000 false or misleading statements between his inauguration and late May of this year. For instance, he blamed Obama for “bad” and “broken” tests for COVID-19, even though scientists first discovered the virus nearly three years after Obama had left office.

Friendly call with Russia's Putin

Republicans went after Obama after an open microphone caught him telling a Russian official that he would have more negotiating flexibility after the 2012 election. They also expressed indignation at his acknowledgment that countries other than the United States believe that they are exceptional.

But Obama later made clear that he believed in American exceptionalism after Russian President Vladimir Putin had warned of its dangers. Trump then weighed in — on the Russian side. He said Putin's view “made him look like a great leader” and “if you're in Russia, you don't want to hear that America is exceptional.”

Coronavirus complication: Trump's science denial is un-American. Just ask Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson.

Obama, like Ronald Reagan and other presidents, was stressing that our exceptionalism stemmed from our ideals. In scorning that view, Trump rejected an essential element of our national identity — which is perhaps why Putin wanted him to win in 2016.

On Monday, the same day that he had his contentious call with American governors, Trump had a friendly call with Putin.

From a conservative standpoint, Barack Obama was not an ideal president. But he was decent, honorable and patriotic. Donald Trump is none of these things.

kedubw	obama	‘The Daily Show’: Barack Obama Expands On His “Defund The Police” Criticisms, Calls For More “Precise” Language In Social Justice Efforts	"Earlier this month, President Barack Obama caught heat for criticizing calls to defund the police. On Tuesday night, the former POTUS explained his critiques to The Daily Show host Trevor Noah.

As Black Lives Matter and anti-police brutality demonstrations sparked across the country following the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, “defund the police” became a rallying cry for protestors and activists demanding that local and federal governments reallocate funds from police departments to other divisions, such as social and public health work. However, Obama claimed that the “snappy slogan” can make those calling for justice lose “a big audience the minute you say it.”

He clarified that the problem isn’t the idea of redistributing the police resources itself, but rather the language used.

“That particular slogan I think the concern is there may be potential allies out there that you’d lose. The issue always is how do you get enough people to support your cause that you can actually institutionalize it and translate it into laws?,” he told Noah.

Obama goes on to express that slogans that hint at direct action, as opposed to something more universal like “Make America Great Again” or “Yes We Can,” need further explanation. He said that “defund the police” might make some Americans, of all races and backgrounds, worry about their safety and their comfort.

“The issue to me is not making me comfortable, but can we be precise with our language enough that people who might be persuaded by that particular issue to make a particular change that gets a particular result that we want. What’s the best way for us to describe that?,” he added.

He said that various roles in society, such as activists and politicians, require appropriate language, even if they’re pushing for the same goal and changes.

While many took Obama’s earlier criticism of the slogan as a slight against the Black Lives Matter movement and efforts to establish justice for the victims of police brutality, the former president said that isn’t the case and praised the activists.

“I have consistently believed that their courage, activisms, media savvy, strategic result far exceeds anything I could’ve done at their age and it has shifted the conversation in ways i would not have even imagined a couple of years ago,” he said.

l6d6c9	obama	"Amanda Gorman reveals what she overheard Michelle Obama telling Barack at inauguration — The 22-year-old inspired the world when she read her poem ""The Hill We Climb"" at Joe Biden's inauguration."	"When 22-year-old Amanda Gorman became the youngest poet to speak at a presidential inauguration last week, she got to rub elbows with plenty of big names in politics and pop culture, from Lady Gaga to A-Rod.

In fact, during the program, she was seated next to Jennifer Lopez and at one point overheard a conversation between Michelle and Barack Obama, which she told Ellen DeGeneres about in a recent appearance on her show.

""I was there, and I remember Michelle Obama being close, and she kind of kept yelling at Barack, 'Stop hugging people, stop getting close to people,'"" Gorman said, smiling. ""And then when I was done, she kind of pushed him out the way and gave me just the biggest, warmest Michelle Obama.""

Watch TODAY All Day! Get the best news, information and inspiration from TODAY, all day long.

DeGeneres then asked if Gorman had ever met the Obamas before, and she replied that she'd met the former first lady a few times but never the former president.

""Whenever I meet Michelle, I hope that she forgets meeting me because I just want a do-over. I just want a clean slate. I just want to do it right this time,"" she quipped. ""But she always remembers, and she's always great. And when I hug her, I'm so short my forehead is, like, in her belly button, and it's the best.""

Gorman then recalled the moment she checked her phone after reading her poem because she wondered what people were saying on social media about it.

""Just my apps, my phone (were) not functioning,"" she said. ""My phone was basically a brick, like all the apps that I typically use had crashed. I couldn't look at my photos or anything like that, and I hadn't expected that. I thought, oh, maybe I'll get a few thousand more followers. To get millions and millions of followers in under 48 hours was just — I think that was the moment when I went, wow, this has really touched people in a way that I did not predict.""

The poem that Gorman read, ""The Hill We Climb,"" resonated with so many that she’ll be reciting at the 2021 Super Bowl, as well. But it wasn't just her words that attracted attention, her general aura on Inauguration Day did, too. Gorman told Vogue her vibrant yellow coat was a nod to first lady Jill Biden, and she wore earrings gifted to her by none other than Oprah Winfrey.

Her way of speaking, though, was perhaps the most inspirational because according to an interview from 2018 with Understood, she was diagnosed with an auditory processing disorder in kindergarten and has struggled with speech articulation throughout her life. But she used reciting poetry as her own form of speech pathology, eventually becoming the United States' first National Youth Poet Laureate in 2017.

""I hear this strong, self-assured voice when I am reading this simple text, and what that told me is the power of your inner voice over that which people might hear with their ears,"" Gorman told TODAY's Jenna Bush Hager in a 2018 interview. ""The only thing that can impede me is myself."""	left
ky2b1d	obama	Obama urges Republican leaders to 'choose reality'	"Former President Barack Obama said the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday is “a moment of great dishonor and shame” for the United States, but not a surprise.

In a statement Wednesday night, Obama criticized President Donald Trump’s repeated but baseless accusations of fraud in the 2020 presidential election.”For two months now, a political party and its accompanying media ecosystem has too often been unwilling to tell their followers the truth — that this was not a particularly close election and that President-elect Biden will be inaugurated on January 20,” he said.

Obama went on to commend Republican leaders — including state and local officials — who have spoken out against the president’s rhetoric. “We need more leaders like these — right now and in the days, weeks, and months ahead as President-elect Biden works to restore a common purpose in our politics.”

Obama is one of a number of current and former public officials who have released statements in the aftermath of a violent pro-Trump mob forcing its way into the Capitol building today.

Amid the clashes between his supporters and police, Trump released a video statement doubling down on his false election fraud claims while also asking that protests remain peaceful and respect law enforcement."	left

Asked by Scott Pelley about President Donald Trump’s refusal to concede and his claims of election fraud, Obama said, “I’m more troubled by the fact that other Republican officials who clearly know better are going along with this, are humoring him in this fashion. It is one more step in delegitimizing not just the incoming Biden administration, but democracy generally. And that’s a dangerous path.”

Obama sat down with Pelley on Wednesday for an interview that will air on 60 Minutes on Sunday. The former president also spoke to Gayle King for an interview that will be shown on CBS Sunday Morning.

Obama suggested that Trump’s claims were not altogether surprising.

“They appear to be motivated– in part because– the president doesn’t like to lose and — never admits loss,” Obama said.

The excerpt of the interview was shown on Thursday on CBS Evening News with Norah O’Donnell.

Obama also has other interviews lined up, including one with Oprah Winfrey that will debut on November 17. That interview — The Oprah Conversation: President Barack Obama — will be available for free on Apple TV+."	left

jur0xg	obama	Barack Obama rules out role in Biden cabinet – 'Michelle would leave me'	"Barack Obama would not take a position in Joe Biden’s cabinet if the president-elect offered it – because if he did, he fears, Michelle Obama would leave him.

The 44th president made the remark in an interview with CBS Sunday Morning, two days ahead of publication of his memoir, A Promised Land. He was due to speak to CBS again, for 60 Minutes, on Sunday night.

Biden, Obama’s vice-president from 2009 to 2017, is preparing to become the 46th president in January, having defeated Donald Trump at the polls.

Asked how he will help Biden, Obama said: “He doesn’t need my advice, and I will help him in any ways that I can. Now, I’m not planning to suddenly work on the White House staff or something.”

Susan Rice and Michelle Flournoy are among Obama administration veterans reportedly being considered for key posts under Biden.

Asked if he would consider a cabinet position, Obama said: “There are some things I would not be doing because Michelle would leave me. She’d be like, what? You’re doing what?”

The Obamas have enough to occupy their time as it is, not least through establishing a charitable foundation and fulfilling a production deal with Netflix.

In his book, Obama considers what his meteoric rise to the US Senate and then the White House meant for his marriage to Michelle and family life with their daughters, Sasha and Malia.

“My career in politics, with its prolonged absences, had made it even tougher” for his wife to pursue her own law career, he writes. “More than once Michelle had decided not to pursue an opportunity that excited her but would have demanded too much time away from the girls.

“… With my election [as president] she’d been forced to give up a job with real impact for a role [as first lady] that – in its original design, at least – was far too small for her gifts.”

The Obamas’ literary gifts have at least paid off. A Promised Land is part of a reported $65m deal with Penguin Random House that also covered Becoming, Michelle Obama’s memoir, released in 2018, and which has sold more than 10m copies. The former president is expected to produce a second volume.

He also discussed the first with Oprah Winfrey, for Apple TV in an interview scheduled to broadcast in full on Tuesday.

In a released clip, Obama told Winfrey he and Michelle “went through our rough patches in the White House, as she’s written about, she’s talked about. But I tell you that the thing that I think we were good about was talking stuff through, never losing fundamental love and respect for each other, and prioritising our kids.”

Though Trump shows no sign of willingly giving up power, his memoirs are already the subject of speculation – and a rumoured $100m price tag.

Another passage of Obama’s CBS interview might have had resonance for the current president, had he been watching.

Obama discussed what it is like to have the luxurious trappings of office, in this instance the presidential motorcade, inevitably taken away.

“I’m driving along,” Obama said, laughing. “I’m still not driving, but [I’m] in the car. I’m in the car in the backseat and I’m looking at my iPad or something. And suddenly, we stop and I’m like, ‘What’s going on?’ There’s a red light. There’s a car right next to us. Some kids are eating a burrito or something in the backseat.

Obama has been making the rounds on behalf of his friend, who’s running against President Donald Trump, in the final days leading up to the 2020 election on Nov. 3.

[TRENDING: ‘Smell of rotting flesh’ leads to body in trunk | How to celebrate Halloween during pandemic | 98 ‘murder hornets’ removed]

The drive-in rally was held outside Camping World Stadium Tuesday with the former president taking the stage at noon.

Ad

Obama energized the crowd by drawing parallels, listing things Trump has done during the past four years and explaining what Biden and his running mate Sen. Kamala Harris would do instead.

“Florida has the highest enrollment under the Affordable Care Act of any state in America. Last week Trump went out and said he hopes the Supreme Court takes your health insurance away. Don’t boo, vote,” Obama said. “And last night he installed the Supreme Court justice he hopes will help him do it.”

He said Americans will see improvements to their health care if Biden and Harris are elected.

“This is serious and Joe and Kamala will protect your health care, they will expand Medicare, they’ll make insurance more affordable for everybody because Joe knows that a president’s first job is to keep us safe from all threats: foreign, domestic and microscopic,” Obama said.

The coronavirus pandemic was anther major talking point Tuesday with Obama saying that Biden would find a way to make testing free and widely available, distribute a vaccine and ensure that workers receive paid sick leave should they become infected.

Ad

In terms of non policy-related issues, Obama also questioned Trump’s behavior when it comes to social media and the way he talks about some of his political opponents.

“I mean, we’ve gotten so numb to what is bizarre behavior. We have a president right now who lies multiple times a day and this is not my claim -- even Fox News sometimes says, ‘Well, what he says isn’t really true. He didn’t mean it.’ It’s not normal behavior... Even Florida man wouldn’t be doing some of this stuff,” Obama said.

Ultimately Obama’s message to attendees was to make sure their voices are heard because it could be a tight race and every vote counts, especially in swing states like Florida.

“We can’t just dream for a better future, we’ve got to fight for a better future. We’ve got to out hustle the other side. We’ve got to vote like never before,” Obama said. “So make a plan. Vote as early as you can, grab your friends and your family, get them to vote all the way up and down the ticket. And if we pour all our efforts into this final week, if we vote like never before, then we will elect Joe Biden as president of the United States. We will elect Kamala Harris as vice president of the United States.”

Both candidates have been spending a lot of time in Florida ahead of the presidential election. The Sunshine State, in particular the I-4 corridor from Orlando to Tampa, is critical to winning the election. Trump visited The Villages, Ocala and Sanford last week and voted in West Palm Beach on Saturday.

Meanwhile, the Biden campaign is using celebrity power to encourage people to vote.

Rapper and activist Common performed Saturday in Orlando at Florida Rights Restoration Coalition’s #FreeTheVote event and took part in a roundtable discussion with union workers, representing thousands of workers in the service industry.

On Sunday, actress America Ferrera was in Orlando and Tampa for Biden events on a “Get out the Vote” bus tour.

Obama started his campaign rounds in Philadelphia and made another stop in Miami on Saturday.

Obama already had hosted virtual events geared to younger voters and lent his name to texts and emails encouraging supporters to register to vote and donate money to the campaign. He has also been a big money draw for the campaign. One virtual fundraiser he headlined with Biden in June brought in $7.6 million, and he’s raised money and appeared in ads for down-ballot Democrats.

Obama himself has already cast his 2020 ballot and no surprise, he voted for his friend Joe. Obama said he voted by mail like millions of Americans will this year."	left

Last night’s numbers were also impacted by NFL overrun, which likely will influence the final numbers.

NBC’s Sunday Night Football (3.7, 12.86M) saw a significant stumble from last week as the New England Patriots beat the Baltimore Ravens; last week’s New Orleans-Tampa Bay game earned a 4.1 in the demo. Because it is a live sporting event, these numbers are also likely to be adjusted in the finals.

Fox’s primetime lineup also kicked off with some NFL fare, which was good The Simpsons (1.2, 3.40M). The iconic animated series doubled its numbers from last week while seeing a surge in audience amid the overrun. From there, Fox’s Sunday night animation block saw a tick up across the board in early numbers with Bless the Harts (0.6, 1.76M), Bob’s Burgers (0.7, 1.71M) and Family Guy (0.7, 1.68M).

After slipping week to week, ABC’s revival of Supermarket Sweep (0.8, 3.26M) climbed a tenth in the demo from last week. Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (0.5, 2.95M) also ticked up, while America’s Funniest Home Videos (0.7, 5.03M) and Card Sharks (0.3, 1.97M) were steady.

After 60 Minutes, CBS’ night included NCIS: Los Angeles (1.0, 8.45M), which ticked up from last week’s season premiere, and NCIS: New Orleans (0.5, 5.05M), which dipped a tenth."	left

The claim: Barack Obama never mentioned Juneteenth while in office

During this month's celebration of Juneteenth, a holiday commemorating the end of slavery, a Facebook post made the claim that former President Barack Obama never mentioned the holiday during his entire eight years in office.

The claim came a few days after President Donald Trump told the Wall Street Journal, on June 17, that before his rally ""nobody had ever heard of"" Juneteenth. PolitiFact published a fact-check the following day that rated Trump's claim as ""pants on fire"" false.

The Facebook post asks readers, ""how come black Obama in 8 years never mentioned Juneteenth?"" However, it provides no evidence to support the claim.

The user could not be reached for comments or clarification.

Obama's history with Juneteenth

The former president of the United States has a long history with the holiday, dating back to his days as an Illinois state senator.

In 2003, he was one of many co-sponsors of SB1028, a bill that made Juneteenth a state-recognized holiday in Illinois.

According to White House archives, during his time in the Oval Office, Obama made an official White House statement regarding Juneteenth on seven separate occasions, beginning during his first year in office in 2009, with the exception of 2013, based on our research. That year, he was in Berlin on Juneteenth.

Several tweets from the White House's official account also coincided with the statements from past years.

""On this day in 1865, more than two years after President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, those who found themselves still enslaved in Galveston, Texas had their hopes realized and their prayers answered,"" Obama's 2009 statement read. ""Contrary to what others had told them, the rumors they had heard were indeed true. The Civil War had ended, and they were now free.""

Obama has also continued to advocate for the holiday even after leaving the Oval Office. In recent weeks, Obama commemorated Juneteenth by sharing a New York Times opinion column, along with a comment of his own.

""Juneteenth has never been a celebration of victory or an acceptance of the way things are. It's a celebration of progress. It's an affirmation that despite the most painful parts of our history, change is possible — and there is still so much work to do,"" Obama tweeted.

USA TODAY has reached out to the former president's team for comment.

What is Juneteenth?

According to the Congressional Research Service, Juneteenth ""marks the date that Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, and announced the end of both the Civil War and slavery."" The announcement was delivered on June 19, 1865.

Although the Emancipation Proclamation came two-and-a-half years prior in 1863, many slave owners continued to hold slaves because of the lack of communication channels. Thus, this date is largely symbolic of African-American freedom.

According to the Texas State Historical Association, Texans began celebrating Juneteenth, recreationally, as early as 1866. These events included ""public entertainment, picnics, and family reunions"" often featuring ""dramatic readings, pageants, parades, barbecues, and ball games.""

A year later, under the direction of the Freedmen's Bureau, Juneteenth was first celebrated at the Texas state capital. By the 1870s, some cities had even purchased specific land tracts for celebrations, most notably Emancipation Park in Houston, Texas.

According to the Texas State Library, migration to the neighboring states of Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma saw cultural celebrations like Juneteenth slowly become adopted. Other states included Alabama, Florida, and California.

According to Juneteenth.com, the holiday continued to gain strong support up until WWII, when a mix of social issues led to the celebration of Juneteenth significantly declining. It was not until the civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s that a resurgence in Juneteenth would be sparked.

According to the Library of Congress, Texas became the first state to proclaim Juneteenth an official state holiday in 1980. Since then, all but three states have officially recognized Juneteenth as a state holiday: Hawaii, North Dakota and South Dakota.

Our rating: False

We rate the claim that former President Barack Obama did not mention Juneteenth while in office as FALSE because it is not supported by our research. During his time in the Oval Office, the former president released many official White House statements commemorating the date. The White House, and president, have also tweeted out Juneteenth content on multiple occasions recognizing the holiday during the Obama administration.

m4ckai	obama	Former President Barack Obama on How He Managed His Mental Health While In Office [routine: morning exercise, dinner with family]	"It takes work to manage mental health, even—or especially—for presidents. And former president Barack Obama gave a few new details about the things that helped him while in office in a recent interview with TheSkimm as part of its Minute to Skimm It digital series.

“In jobs of great stress, like the presidency, mental health has to be a priority,” Obama told TheSkimm. He said he's “fortunate to have a naturally pretty calm and steady temperament,” but noted that some activities really helped him manage his mental health.

“The two things that were most important for me was exercise in the morning, hitting the gym. And the second thing was family; having a block of time with my girls and with Michelle that was inviolate unless there was a genuine immediate crisis,” he explained. “I was at dinner at 6:30 every night. And you know, listening to my daughters talk about their days and stupid boys and strange teachers and gossip and weird questions, that always put my mind right.”

Courtesy of theSkimm.

The value of having routines like these—especially in the mornings and evenings to help transition to and from work hours—is something many of us are realizing more than ever during the COVID-19 pandemic. For both the former president and former first lady, those workouts generally included (and still include) circuit training “with weights, with kettlebells, with bands and tubes and TRXs to keep the body guessing,” their longtime trainer Cornell McClellan told People previously. The two are also fans of boxing, McClellan said. “For people with high-stress jobs, boxing really works for them. To be able to punch some things.”

Former first lady Michelle Obama has also been particularly open about her experience with “low-grade depression” during the pandemic and recent protests against police brutality. “I’m waking up in the middle of the night because I’m worrying about something or there’s a heaviness,” she said previously. But both keeping up a routine (involving regular workouts, spending time outside, and family mealtimes) and allowing herself some room to take breaks as necessary have been helpful for her.

More recently the former first lady said in an interview with People that “depression is understandable during these times. I needed to acknowledge what I was going through, because a lot of times we feel like we have to cover that part of ourselves up, that we always have to rise above and look as if we're not paddling hard underneath the water.""

lh0trj	obama	Bill would place historical markers at 9 sites on Oahu to honor Barack Obama	"Mahalo for supporting Honolulu Star-Advertiser. Enjoy this free story!

State Sen. Stanley Chang is seeking once again to honor significant sites in the life of Hawaii-born President Barack Obama with historical markers. Read more

State Sen. Stanley Chang is seeking once again to honor significant sites in the life of Hawaii-born President Barack Obama with historical markers.

Chang (D, Diamond Head-Kahala-Hawaii Kai) introduced Senate Bill 44, requiring the state Department of Land and Natural Resources’ State Historic Preservation Division to place nine markers around Hawaii identifying the sites, including Kapiolani Medical Center for Women &Children, Baskin-Robbins on King Street, Punahou Circle Apartments, Punahou School and Sandy Beach, among others.

“President Barack Obama has become a historical figure in our nation’s history and much of his success is credited to his upbringing here in Hawaii,” said Chang in a news release. “Placing these historical markers at significant sites special to President Obama is one way that we can honor his contributions and recognize him as a true son of Hawaii.”

The effort to commemorate Obama has been in the works for several years now, according to Chang, who said he has introduced similar bills in the past. As a Honolulu city councilman in 2014, Chang introduced a resolution to rename Sandy Beach after Obama but did not succeed.

“This is a continuation of our efforts,” said Chang. “I believe Hawaii should commemorate the historic life and upbringing of our very own President Barack Obama.”

Chang said the nine markers are just a conversation starter and that he’s willing to consider numerous other sites of significance. Among the ones listed in the bill are places that Obama has mentioned publicly as well as written about in his memoirs.

The bill appropriates funds to DLNR for the historical markers, but no specified amount is listed on the bill yet. If private businesses do not agree to the marker, then it shall be placed on public property nearest to the site, according to the bill.

“I don’t anticipate it would cost very much,” Chang told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. “We’re not talking about monuments. The cost would be modest.”

Chang pointed out that more than a dozen states have named schools after Obama, while others have named highways or roads after him, but not in Hawaii.

“I’m not aware of anything in the state of Hawaii named for him, and I think that’s a sad oversight on our part,” said Chang. “This is our local boy. This is a president born here, raised here, who truly understands our values and represented the whole country with distinction during his office.”

Obama, the 44th U.S. president, attended Punahou School while living at Punahou Circle Apartments in Makiki with his grandparents, and worked at Baskin-Robbins as a teen. As a Democratic presidential candidate, he was famously photographed bodysurfing at Sandy’s in 2008.

During his presidency from 2009 to 2017, he vacationed several times on Oahu, regularly got shave ice with his family at Island Snow in Kailua and hiked Koko Crater Trail at Koko Head District Park in Hawaii Kai.

The full list of sites proposed in the bill:

>> 6085 Kalanianaole Highway

>> Baskin-Robbins on King Street

>> Island Snow Hawaii

>> Kapiolani Medical Center for Women &Children

>> Koko Crater Trail

>> Noelani Elementary School

>> Punahou Circle Apartments

laa4ll	obama	Barack Obama lauded Hank Aaron for persevering through virulent racism. Old letters show how much the baseball legend endured.	"Barack Obama penned a beautiful tribute to Hank Aaron after the baseball legend died Friday at 86 years old.

The former president lauded Aaron for both his talent on the diamond and his tenacity to endure racism off of it.

Letters circulating on social media depict the degree of virulent hatred Aaron faced while chasing Babe Ruth's famous home run record.

Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.

In a letter released shortly after Hank Aaron's death Friday morning, Barack Obama lauded the baseball legend not only for his talent on the diamond but also for his tenacity off of it.

The 44th president of the United States penned a brilliant tribute to the one-time home run king, referring to Aaron as ""one of the best baseball players we've ever seen and one of the strongest people I've ever met.""

""Today, Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to the Aaron family,"" Obama wrote. ""And everyone who was inspired by this unassuming man and his towering example.""

Obama then detailed the arduous conditions through which Aaron rose to baseball's greatest heights. After growing up in the Jim Crow South, Aaron ""quit high school to join the Negro League"" for a measly $200 per month paycheck. Eventually, he made his way to Major League Baseball, where the ""humble and hardworking"" outfielder quietly became one of the foremost sluggers of the league.

That is, ""until he started chasing Babe Ruth's home run record.""

At that point, Obama noted, Aaron ""began receiving death threats and racist letters"" from bigots who did not want to see a Black man overtake one of baseball's most sacred records. Copies of those letters circulated on social media Friday after Aaron's passing. They bluntly depict the virulent intolerance one of the greatest to ever play the game faced en route to his crowning achievement.

—Niles Edward Francis (@NilesGApol) January 22, 2021

Obama noted that Aaron did not allow prejudice to stand in his way. ""Hammerin' Hank"" broke Ruth's longtime record and went on to ascend the ranks of MLB, becoming ""one of the first Black Americans to hold a senior management position"" in the sport. Even after achieving such successes, Aaron would reread those hateful letters ""decades later to remind himself 'not to be surprised or hurt'"" by racism's continued hold on many.

As someone who faced considerable vitriol throughout his career, Obama surely looked up to Aaron's example. He and Michelle had a relationship with Aaron and his wife, Billye, and Obama noted that spending time with the couple served as an important reminder that they ""stood on the shoulders of a previous generation of trailblazers.""

mwg0f0	obama	"Obama urges Black Americans to ""keep marching, keep speaking up, keep voting"""	"Washington — Former President Barack Obama encouraged Black Americans to ""keep marching, keep speaking up, keep voting"" to usher in progress throughout the nation after a year that was marred by the coronavirus pandemic and the deaths of unarmed Black men by law enforcement.

In an interview with BET.com published Thursday, Mr. Obama noted the challenges of 2020 ""can make you wonder if things will ever get better,"" but said that for policies to be changed, ""we cannot let up during these next four"" years.

""The people who benefit from keeping things the way they are — they are counting on your cynicism,"" the former president told BET.com when asked for his message to Black Americans. ""They know they can't win you over with their policies. So they're hoping to convince you that your vote, and your voice, doesn't matter. That's how they win. And that's why we need to keep marching, keep speaking up, keep voting.""

2020 brought unprecedented challenges before the nation, as Americans grappled with a pandemic that has killed more than 569,000 in the U.S., a bruising presidential election and the deaths of unarmed Black men at the hands of law enforcement, including George Floyd in May.

Caught on camera by Darnella Frazier, Floyd's killing sent shockwaves throughout the country and sparked nationwide protests against police brutality, as Americans watched Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin kneel on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes while he lay prone, struggling to breath. A Hennepin County, Minnesota, jury convicted Chauvin of murder on Tuesday.

Amid the demonstrations last summer, House Democrats put forth a sweeping police reform measure that came to be named for Floyd, while local and state officials ordered changes to policing tactics to curtail police violence.

Reflecting on the social movement sparked by Floyd's death to call attention to systemic racism and police brutality, Mr. Obama said it's important for those who want to change the status quo to continue ""making your voice heard."" Protesting, he added, has ""often been the only way to get people's attention.""

""But eventually, movements have to be translated into laws and policies — and in a democracy, that only happens when we elect government officials who are responsive to our demands,"" he said. ""In this case, we need to elect state and local officials who will make fighting systemic racism and guaranteeing equal justice a priority. We need to pass ballot initiatives and other measures that will do the same. And we also need to bring community groups, elected officials, and police departments together to make real change.

""In other words,"" Mr. Obama continued, ""I think anyone who believes in change should reject the false choice between participating in protests or politics. We need both.""

While Floyd's death led lawmakers on Capitol Hill to roll out legislation that aims to hold law enforcement accountable, it has only passed the Democratic-led House and faces an uphill battle in the Senate. There, Republicans take issue with a provision that would reform qualified immunity, the legal doctrine that protects police from lawsuits for constitutional violations, and warn the overhaul could hurt law enforcement officers acting in good faith.

But the guilty verdict in the case against Chauvin has given the bill, which also bans chokeholds and no-knock warrants in drug cases, new momentum, with a bipartisan group of lawmakers in discussions over police reforms. President Biden has urged lawmakers to send the measure to his desk, and the White House said he plans to elevate the issue during his joint address to Congress next week.

While Mr. Obama encouraged Americans to continue fighting, he lamented the country's deep political, cultural, ideological and geographic divisions, which the former president said ""seem to be deeper than just differences in policy.""

""Until we can agree on a common set of facts, until we can distinguish between what's true and what's false, then the marketplace of ideas won't work. Our democracy won't work,"" he said. ""So, as citizens, we need to push our institutions in the direction of addressing these challenges.""

But Mr. Obama stressed the importance of Americans remaining consistently engaged, beyond presidential election years and in the wake of tragedy.

""I know it can be exhausting,"" he said. ""But for this democracy to endure, we need active citizenship and sustained focus on the issues — not just in an election season, but all the days in between."""	left

Barack and Michelle Obama are paying tribute to the late Cicely Tyson.

Not long after it was announced that the iconic actress died at age 96 on Thursday evening, Barack, 59, and Michelle, 57, each shared heartwarming messages on their respective Instagram accounts to honor Tyson and her incomparable legacy.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

First posting a photograph of himself standing beside his wife and Tyson, Barack also shared a shot of himself awarding the late actress with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016.

Describing Tyson as having ""a heart unlike any other ,"" he wrote, ""When Cicely Tyson was born, doctors predicted she wouldn't make it three months because of a murmur in her heart. What they didn't know, what they couldn't know, was that Cicely had a heart unlike any other.""

Barack continued his lengthy statement, adding, ""The kind that would not only beat for 96 more years but leave a mark on the world that few could match.""

Then, acknowledging Tyson's ""extraordinary career,"" her upbringing, and her need to ""speak her truth,"" the former president detailed more about her illustrious Hollywood life and her dedication to her craft.

""At a time when parts for actors who looked like her weren't easy to come by, she refused to take on roles that reduced Black women to their gender or their race. Sometimes, that meant she would go years without work,"" he said. ""But she took pride in knowing that whenever her face was on camera, she would be playing a character who was a human being — flawed but resilient; perfect not despite but because of their imperfections.""

Reflecting on the Medal of Freedom ceremony, Barack said that he and Michelle ""were honored"" when Tyson came to the White House to receive the honor, because, as he added, Tyson knew ""she was one of the many giants upon whose shoulders we stood — a trailblazer whose legacy couldn't be measured by her Emmys and Tony and Oscar alone, but by the barriers she broke and the dreams she made possible.""

Closing out his statement, Barack said, ""We are sending our thoughts and prayers to every member of Cicely's family and to all of those who loved her. And while we are saddened that her heart finally came to a rest today, there is comfort in knowing that she will always live on in ours.""

In her own reflective statement, Michelle similarly paid tribute to Tyson, posting two photographs of herself with the Tony Award-winning star, describing how she admired Tyson for her ""humanity.""

""What struck me every time I spent time with Cicely Tyson was not necessarily her star power—though that was evident enough—it was her humanity,"" Michelle captioned her post on Thursday. ""Just by walking into a room, she had this way of elevating everyone around her.""

Michelle continued, ""She was the personification of beauty, grace, wisdom, and strength, carrying forward a flame that not only guided her for 96 pathbreaking years but lit the way for so many of us.""

Closing out her tribute by noting that she would ""miss her dearly,"" Michelle added, ""I smile knowing how many people she inspired, just like me, to walk a little taller, speak a little more freely, and live a little bit more like God intended.""

Tyson's manager, Larry Thompson, previously announced the news of his client's death in a statement given on Thursday.

""I have managed Miss Tyson's career for over 40 years, and each year was a privilege and blessing,"" Thompson said, before referencing her recently released memoir — Just As I Am — as he continued his statement. ""Cicely thought of her new memoir as a Christmas tree decorated with all the ornaments of her personal and professional life. Today she placed the last ornament, a Star, on top of the tree."""	left

America's first Black president sits down with White House correspondent April Ryan to discuss his new memoir 'A Promised Land'

Loading the player...

Former President Barack Obama had a virtual sit-down with White House correspondent April Ryan to discuss his new book, A Promised Land, which is close to two million copies sold so far, as reported by theGrio. The first of a two-part memoir discusses Obama’s groundbreaking and tumultuous tenure as the nation’s first Black President.

Ryan addressed a passage in the book about how President Obama became depressed after losing support from many white citizens over race relations. He recalled speaking about how esteemed Harvard professor and TV host Dr. Henry Louis Gates was arrested in 2009 for trying to get back into his own house after his door was jammed, as reported by The New York Times.

“I made a very mild comment about the fact that, well, you know, I think that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody in their own home, a 60-year-old, you know, man who posed no threat. And this became a big controversy,” said President Obama.

Obama contended that he lost favor with many white constituents because it appeared that he was condemning law enforcement as a whole.

“But just the fact that I was seen questioning the police, even in a fairly balanced, modest way, you know, it really upset a bunch of folks,” he said. “And I think it indicated the degree to which the issue of police relations with minority communities, and the Black community, in particular, is always a hot topic. It is something that unearths or, you know, escalates fears.”

Ryan asked President Obama if he believed that the white people who lost favor with him eventually became supporters of his successor, President Donald Trump. While Obama did not say definitively whether or not that was the case, he did state that those aforementioned fears of whites were used as ammunition for Trump to rally them to the polls in 2016.

“What is also true is there’s no doubt that my successor, Donald Trump, tried to fan those fears rather than fairly address them,” he said.

Now that Obama’s former Vice President Joe Biden will become the next commander-in-chief, he recognizes that millions of people see the president-elect as a new hope following the divisive Trump administration. However, he isn’t naïve. He knows that healing will take time.

“I don’t think Joe Biden is going to fix racism in America any more than I was going to fix racism in America. But I have great confidence that Joe will do and the people who surround Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the White House can do is to set a tone of inclusiveness, to send a message that racism is not acceptable,” said Obama.

One way to help ensure the Biden administration will have any success is having a Senate without a Republican majority. While the former president is still uncertain if he’ll physically travel to Georgia to help campaign for Democratic candidates Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock in the state’s Senate run-offs in January, he says he’ll be “active” in his support, as it will affect Biden’s ability to bring forth important changes for disenfranchised communities.

Calling the Georgia run-offs “ground zero” in terms of being a crucial event to ensure Biden’s ability to get legislation passed that aids Black Americans, President Obama wants to see voters educating themselves on the issues and maintaining their enthusiasm to vote in the run-off.

“I hope you guys are even more activated now than you were in November because the control of the Senate will be determined in Georgia,” President Obama said.

“If Democrats are able to tie up the Senate where it’s 50/50 and the vice president is the tiebreaker, that could make the difference in terms of can we, you know, have a significant, you know, recovery, economic recovery bill that helps, you know, African-American businesses and small businesses that are hurting and helps frontline workers who are about to see relief, you know, support run out.”

President Trump has often referred to numerous news outlets and reporters as “fake news” over the years, with Ryan often being a personal target of Trump’s condemnation. She asked President Obama if he felt that with Trump gone, will a Biden administration restore the respect and trust between the White House and the press.

“I think you’ll see some return to the norms that had been followed not just by me, but by Republicans and Democrats prior to me,” President Obama stated. “I do think we’re still going to have challenges with respect to the splintering of the press and major news outlets and emerging news outlets, as well as social media sites that do not follow the basic standards and tenets of the press that you learned your craft, you know, coming up, observing.”

President Obama feels that select news publications and stations have been biased for the Trump administration and that’s been more harmful than Trump’s scathing rhetoric against outlets like CNN and MSNBC.

“You look at companies like a Newsmax that just are mimicking the wild accusations, unfounded accusations made by Donald Trump about this election without regard to any support or evidence of these claims, and lots of people are soaking that in. A lot of people are believing that,” he said.

He added that “some thought pressure and conversation” from the public is a method to hold such outlets accountable for the type of news coverage that reaches and influences the masses.

“All of us are going to have to figure out how do we get back to the point where the truth means something and that you can’t just make stuff up and suddenly half the country believes it, and that’s something that will take effort beyond the White House in order for us to get back to that point.”

With Vice President-elect Kamala Harris being the first woman vice president as well as the first Black vice president, President Obama recognized that his administration opened doors for such an appointment.

“We broke that barrier and I say we because it was a collective effort, it wasn’t just me, it was all people who voted for me, all the staff and volunteers who worked on my behalf.”

When Ryan asked if this meant that the nation was ready for another Black president in the near future, President Obama said the gates are now open for various minorities to reach the Oval Office.

“I think we are getting now to the point where women can aspire and become president, people of color, not just Black, but Latino and Asian American and, you know. Other backgrounds can become president.”

However, he also believes that whoever that may be, they need to be ready for extra observations from the press and potential opponents.

“What I think we all have to acknowledge is that there are going to be some additional burdens for some time to come, for those who don’t look like most of the other presidents, you’re going to be under some different scrutiny.”

mmdco2	obama	President Barack Obama's Favorite Apple Pie — It was developed by former White House Executive Pastry Chef, Bill Yosses and it was President Obama's favorite dessert.	"When it comes to quintessential American desserts, it doesn't get much more patriotic than this apple pie recipe. It was developed by former White House Executive Pastry Chef, Bill Yosses and it was President Obama's favorite dessert.

This pie is stuffed to the gills with apples—a mixture of Granny Smith and Honey Crisp to be exact—and topped with a buttery crust fit for a president, prime minister or whoever else might stop in at the White House. To keep that crust perfectly crisp and avoid a soggy bottom, Chef Yosses insists that is important to par-bake your bottom crust before adding you apple filling.

We love this pie on it's own but if you really feel a need to top it off we recommend some fresh whipped cream or, if you're up for a challenge, homemade vanilla ice cream. Any way you serve it, this pie will be welcome with open arms onto any dessert table.

Carlos Gil/GettyROME—Last week, Salvatore Martello, the mayor of the Sicilian island of Lampedusa, which is just 8 square miles in area, bragged that his island was nearly COVID-free after all of its residents would soon be fully vaccinated.Now, islanders are panicking after more than 2,000 migrants and refugees from all over unvaccinated Africa started arriving in smugglers’ boats on Saturday. By Sunday, 20 boats in all had arrived, carrying some 2,000 desperate souls who had somehow skirted the Libyan Coast Guard and made it all the way across the calm sea.Migrants Rescued at Sea Between Death and HopeLocal business owners voiced concerns that the arrival of migrants en masse has already scared off many people planning their holidays. The owner of the Hotel Baja Turchese said he had received several cancellations by people who were coming because they thought the island would be COVID-free.“The migrants change the dynamic, because even if they have to quarantine and get tested, they have already potentially brought the virus back to the island,” he told The Daily Beast.But many of the asylum-seekers escaping to the island had no choice but to flee the poverty, violence, and persecution they faced in their home countries.On Monday, most of the migrants had been processed and, based on their interviews, were primarily from sub-Saharan Africa, including countries like Eritrea and Somalia that have not yet received a single dose of anti-COVID vaccines. Others were migrant workers who had been laboring in the oil fields of conflict-ridden Libya, where they suffered through consistent wage theft, discrimination and waves of violent civil strife.Because the tiny reception center on the island is not conducive to social distancing, most were made to sleep on the hot pavement under the scorching sun in the dock area to avoid potentially infecting islanders. Until Sunday, the migrant center had been empty for nearly two years.“The situation on Lampedusa is literally explosive,” Domenico Pianese, a police official, said in a statement to local media. “If we have another day like yesterday, with an incessant succession of disembarking, it won’t be possible to manage public and health safety.”The island, which is closer to North Africa than Europe, has long been a magnet for migrants who have crashed their rickety blue fishing boats onto its rocky shores. The island hit a near breaking point in 2011, when thousands of people escaping Arab Spring violence in North Africa arrived.Libya’s Migrant ‘Holding Areas’ Have Become Death CampsBut in 2014, when NGO rescue boats started patrolling the seas after Italy’s government-sponsored Mare Nostrum rescue mission ended, boats carrying migrants were often intercepted and rarely made it to Lampedusa, allowing the island to beef up its tourism industry. This summer, they were hoping for a windfall with stir-crazy Europeans looking for remote beaches and guaranteed sun.It is unclear if Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s recent trip to Libya in any way changed the Libyan Coast Guard’s response to the latest exodus. Italy has trained and funded the Libyan coastguards and supplied them with boats, even as they have been accused of—and caught on video committing—horrific human rights abuses, including shooting at and leaving migrants to drown.When they are intercepted by Libyan coastguards, the migrants are usually taken to squalid detention centers until smugglers, working with complicit guards, try to get them across the sea again. On Monday, the Libyan coastguards stopped some 600 migrants on several smuggler ships from departing, according to UNHCR.The migrants and refugees that arrived will all have to quarantine and be tested, Martello says, and many will isolate on ferries docked off the island or be shuttled to the considerably larger land mass of Sicily. A massive ship is on its way to the island to offer additional accommodation. The bulk of the tests should be done by the end of the week. No COVID test results have yet been released.So far this year, some 12,000 migrants have made it across the sea to Italy—four times the number that made it last year in the same time frame. They have come either on their own in fishing boats or were rescued by one of just a couple of NGO boats allowed to deliver them to land. Late Monday, the NGO group Alarm Phone, which tries to alert authorities to boats in trouble, reported that around 400 people were languishing on boats between Malta and Lampedusa. By nightfall, no one had rescued them.In April, Italy was criticized by humanitarian groups after ignoring distress calls from a boat off Libya, which eventually capsized. At least 130 people were thought to have drowned in that accident. So far this year, around 500 migrants are known to have died at sea trying to reach safety. And they won’t be the last, especially if the group on Lampedusa are viewed only as COVID threats.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

jjcho0	obama	Barack Obama and LeBron James are joining forces in a late push to increase Black voter turnout.	"Former President Barack Obama will continue his efforts to increase Black voter turnout ahead of the election, including an interview with the basketball star LeBron James set to be published this week.

Mr. Obama joined Mr. James for the interview as a part of the athlete’s More Than A Vote initiative, according to sources familiar with the event. More Than A Vote, the collective of athletes led by Mr. James, has focused its political efforts on issues like limiting misinformation among Black voters and increasing poll workers in Black communities.

In a recent interview with The New York Times, Mr. James said he cared more about seeing Black turnout increase than President Trump’s removal.

“You can see it every time. Who didn’t vote? What counties didn’t vote? What communities didn’t vote? And a lot of that has had to do with our Black people,” Mr. James said. “So, hopefully, we can get them out and educated and let them understand how important this moment is.”"	left
krtqgs	obama	No more delays: Time to break ground on the Obama Presidential Center | Editorial	"Construction likely will start this year on the long-delayed $500 million Obama Presidential Center, a development we’ll be glad to see, at last.

The Obama Foundation made a big splash in 2016 when it announced plans to build the center in Jackson Park, a 500-acre green spot, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, that once hosted the famed 1893 World’s Fair.

But a planned 2018 groundbreaking has yet to happen due to civil suits from parks advocates, and because of a lengthy state and federal governmental review assessing the impact of putting the center in the historic park.

The review process ends this month with the state’s Advisory Committee on Historic Preservation signing off on a memorandum of agreement outlining the mitigation steps the Obama Foundation must take for the privilege of building the center in Jackson Park. The Federal Highway Administration and the Illinois State Historic Preservation Office signed the agreement last month.

Editorials

A federal review under the National Environmental Policy Act remains. Officials believe the study could be finished by February. We hope the result is a thumbs-up in favor of the center.

After that, we say let’s get it on.

A needed economic and cultural boost

As a construction project with a four-year build-out, the Obama Center could be an economic boost that provides jobs and opportunities for South Side lakefront communities such as Woodlawn and South Shore that are just beginning to recover from decades of disinvestment.

The center could be a leading Chicago tourism center that boosts the South Side’s arts and culture scene as it joins the Museum of Science and Industry, the DuSable Museum of African American History and the University of Chicago’s Smart Museum.

And the plan promises — on renderings at least — generously-sized plazas and green spaces that would be set aside for outdoor activities.

If programmed correctly, activities there could compliment a host of annual warm weather events in Hyde Park, South Shore and Woodlawn, including the Silver Room’s massive yearly summer block party at 53rd Street and Harper Avenue, and the Chosen Few annual picnic, which draws tens of thousands to Jackson Park just south of the presidential center site.

We’re hoping the Obama Center sparks even more economic and cultural activity, as we’ve seen the Clinton Center do in Arkansas. Since its completion in 2004, the William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park has had a $3.3 billion economic impact in Little Rock, including $2.46 billion in new investment to the city’s downtown, according to a study prepared for the museum’s 10th anniversary.

Those are numbers the South Side and the whole City of Chicago could use.

Questions remain, however

We’re strong supporters of the Obama Presidential Center, first endorsing a proposal to put it in Jackson Park in 2016. Still, we continue to have concerns about its design and some associated public costs.

The center and its grounds are to occupy 20 acres bounded by the Midway Plaisance, Stony Island Avenue, Cornell Drive and 63rd Street. Cornell Drive, a main roadway through the park, would be closed and converted to park space, but the plan calls for widening both Lake Shore Drive and Stony Island Avenue — two thoroughfares that are already approaching highway-grade width as it is. This has to be reexamined.

And so does the cost of altering the roads. The city in 2018 put itself on the hook for $175 million in roadway improvements. Given the tight budget squeeze the city and state will face for years to come as a result of the pandemic, this appropriation requires a relook.

Even if the city wrangles the money out of the federal government, the wisdom of spending that much money in one place — and for one purpose — deserves to be questioned.

We also take issue with the 235-foot height of the Obama Museum, a building the president’s foundation’s website calls “a new landmark for the South Side.”

But it’s a big new landmark. Especially for a park. The building would be almost 40 feet taller than downtown’s Monadnock Building at Jackson and Dearborn streets.

Or consider the 140-foot U.S. Bank Tower, which sticks out like the tallest tree in the forest at 111th Street and the Bishop Ford Expressway. The Obama Museum would be 95 feet taller than that.

We’re hoping the tower’s height — or even its presence at all — can be changed. But there is no doubting that the Obama Center would be a powerful new addition to the Chicago landscape.

We’re ready for the South Side — and Chicago — to benefit from this new institution.

k41k2k	obama	I captured Obama's favorite photo of the 2008 election. It's a reminder of what we've lost.	"I captured Obama's favorite photo of the 2008 election. It's a reminder of what we've lost. The Lincoln Memorial was the obvious place to go on the night America elected its first Black president. There, I found quiet contemplation.

Twelve years ago, in the wee hours of election night 2008, I took a photograph that probably ranks among the least exciting pictures I’ve made in my 35-year career. It shows a group of 26 people standing in a steady drizzle on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, all gathered in the dark around a single transistor radio.

And yet the moment I pressed my shutter, I knew I had captured something special. In a longish exposure because of the dark, it felt as if I had recorded a tiny sliver of our republic for posterity, like one of of those slightly blurry portraits of Abraham Lincoln himself. You just stare through the grain and blur, waiting for some wisdom or guidance to emerge.

In the years since, the quietness of that election night photo — it’s pretty much the polar opposite of what we expect from a victory celebration — has always seemed to resonate with people. Now, in his new memoir, former President Barack Obama singled it out.

“My favorite photograph from that night isn’t of Grant Park at all,” Obama writes. “Rather it’s one I received many years later as a gift, a photograph of the Lincoln Memorial, taken as I was giving my speech in Chicago. It shows a small gathering of people on the stairs, their faces obscured by the darkness, and behind them the giant figure shining brightly, his marble face craggy, his eyes slightly downcast. They’re listening to the radio, I am told, quietly contemplating who we are as a people — and the arc of this thing we call democracy.”

It's not every day that a former president cites your work, and certainly not in one of the most anticipated books in recent memory. Even more, Obama had one of the most celebrated personal photographers ever, Pete Souza. What drew him to my static little image?

Capturing history

Having had a few days to process the thousands of emails I’ve received from excited friends and colleagues (50 calls from my mother alone), I think I might know. And the reason goes straight to the heart of what has transpired in our country since that night, and what has been lost.

First, some logistics. The genesis of the image was, silly enough, my sofa. For two decades as a photojournalist — including nine years at this newspaper — I covered historic events: Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shaking hands, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s swearing-in ceremony, earthquakes in California. But on this night, I was sitting on the couch watching CNN, having traded in my photojournalist credentials for wedding photography. Looking back, I screwed up: I really missed journalism.

Biden's top unification task: Expose Trump team wrongdoing, restore trust in government

At 11 p.m., as CNN anchors gushed about the throngs at Grant Park and the White House, I couldn’t take it anymore. I jumped up and said to my wife, Maya, “I gotta go.”

“Where?"" she asked in disbelief.

“I don’t know! I gotta go and make a picture of something.”

The Lincoln Memorial seemed like the obvious place to go on the night America elected its first Black president: Lincoln himself, Marian Anderson, Martin Luther King Jr.'s “I Have a Dream” speech. And as I approached, I expected to find a crowd of thousands.

I found two dozen.

A TV cameraman leaving the scene shook his head at me. Nothing to see here, he said.

The first thing that struck me was the radio, decidedly more 1958 than 2008. Then, the quiet. No one was speaking. Not more than a mile away, tens of thousands of people were screaming their lungs out. But here, just a voice coming through a little radio.

The arc of history

One of the emails I've received was from Anne Junod, who’s frozen in a bit of blur on the steps just beneath the Lincoln statue. Anne was just out of college when she and two friends jumped in a car.

“When the election was called for Obama,” she wrote me, “we knew we had to get down to the Lincoln Memorial. We were sure there would be thousands of people rushing to the place where MLK Jr. gave his 'I Have a Dream' speech. We wanted to take in the history and sanctity of this night in the place of greatest significance, where MLK Jr. cast his vision for a moment such as this.”

Harry S. Truman's grandson: The messy, impolite history of presidential transitions

“We didn't go to the White House because Obama wasn't there yet,"" Anne explained. ""This moment wasn't about Obama in the White House. It was about the historic struggle that got him there, the work for which is not complete.”

Anne and her friends wanted to honor our nation’s progress. I wanted to be a journalist again. We went to the Lincoln that night because that’s its purpose: We all make a pilgrimage there at some point to “quietly contemplate” our democracy, Republican and Democrat alike, as Obama wrote.

Looking at the picture today, it’s not just the radio that feels a bit ancient. People react to my photograph because it represents a time that feels lost amid the current divisiveness and screaming and shoving. We long for quiet, we long for contemplation, we worry for our democracy.

When people see this photo, it reminds them of those things.

hxxaj8	obama	PolitiFact - No, Obama did not sign a law allowing protesters to be snatched off the streets	"Federal agents can detain law-breaking protesters, but they don’t have authority to snatch them off the streets for merely protesting.

The reference appears to be a law Obama signed regarding the military detention of terrorist suspects, not law-abiding domestic protesters.

As President Donald Trump threatened to deploy federal agents beyond Portland, Ore., to other Democratic-led cities where crime has spiked amid protests, an image shared on Facebook claimed the controversial policy is actually a Democrat’s doing.

Above a photograph of a smiling Barack Obama, text in the image declares:

""When everyone just blames Trump but forgets who actually signed the law authorizing federal agents to snatch protestors off the streets in Portland.""

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

The reference appears to be a law Obama signed regarding the military detention of suspected terrorists, not law-abiding domestic protesters. It doesn’t apply to the current situation.

Federal agents can detain law-breaking protesters, but they don’t have authority to merely snatch them off the streets.

In recent days, federal agents have cracked down on protesters in Portland, where some demonstrations have turned violent. The fact that many federal agents there are not wearing identifiable law enforcement gear and not driving law enforcement vehicles has raised legal questions about the agents’ presence.

Commenters on the Facebook post cited another image. It claims that Obama signed the National Defense Authorization Act, and that Section 1021 allows the president to detain anyone indefinitely for any reason.

Law professor Stephen Vladeck, an expert in constitutional and national security law at the University of Texas, told PolitiFact he has seen the same reference, but it’s erroneous.

Vladeck said the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act signed by Obama includes controversial provisions concerning military detention of terrorism suspects — but it has nothing to do with what’s happening in Portland.

He said a provision known as Section 1315 — which is what the federal Department of Homeland Security says allows agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection to enforce federal laws in Portland — was enacted as part of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. That was signed into law by President George W. Bush. It is that provision that is cited by the Trump White House as the legal basis for the federal agents’ actions.

Federal agents can only enforce federal law, unless they are specifically authorized to enforce state law by the state, said Vanderbilt University law professor Christopher Slobogin, whose specialties include criminal law.

""So, federal agents cannot snatch any protester off the street, only those threatening federal property or personnel, or who are also committing some other federal crime such as drug trafficking or national security laws,"" he said.

Put another way, said Kermit Roosevelt, a professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania who focuses on constitutional law, federal agents have authority to arrest people attacking a federal courthouse, but no government official has the authority to arrest peaceful protestors.

n3c04v	obama	'It’s safe. It’s effective. It’s free': Obama encourages youth vaccinations with TikTok PSA	"Now that all Americans older than 16 are eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine, former President Barack Obama wants to make sure they get them.

Obama, who’s been a leading voice against vaccine hesitancy, teamed with Yahoo News for a public service announcement posted to the outlet’s TikTok account on Friday.

In it, Obama touts the safety and efficacy of vaccines by explaining he and his wife Michelle have already been vaccinated.

""It’s safe. It’s effective. It’s free. I got one. Michelle got one. And you can get one too,"" Obama said on Tik Tok, a social media platform that’s popular with Generation Z. ""It’s the only way we’re going to get back to all the things we love — from safely spending time with grandparents, to going to concerts and watching live sports.""

Obama had previously teamed up with former presidents Clinton, Bush and Carter for a PSA showing them receiving their vaccines. But as vaccine eligibility expanded in April, Obama shifted his message to meet the next wave of recipients on their platform of choice.

RELATED: Former presidents, first ladies urge Americans to get COVID-19 vaccine

According to the Associated Press, Obama is credited with being among the first politicians to harness the influence social media provides. Using it for a PSA is a move familiar to those who witnessed his social media presence propel him from the U.S. Senate to the White House in 2008.

As of May 1, more than 101 million Americans have been fully vaccinated, according to data collected by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That’s roughly a third of the population.

More than 37 million of the inoculated are older than 65, which has been crucial to America’s pandemic recovery. Elderly patients were far more vulnerable to severe illness, hospitalizations and death.

But now studies have shown COVID variants put younger people at higher risk of severe illnesses and hospitalizations.

RELATED: UK variant a 'brand new ballgame,' infecting children in US 'very readily,' epidemiologist warns

A STAT-Harris Poll conducted in March found that more than half (52%) of Americans between 18 and 24 years old have either already gotten a vaccine or plan to do so when it’s available.

But the remaining 47% presented a troubling trend in America’s race to herd immunity.

Fifteen percent said they would not accept a vaccine, 9% said they’d get one when they get around to it and 23% said they’d wait a while and see.

The claim: Former President Barack Obama jokingly tweeted about President Donald Trump's Twitter ban

President Donald Trump's permanent suspension from Twitter sent shock waves through the internet, bringing forth a mix of reactions from lawmakers, celebrities and beyond.

While former President Barack Obama has not publicly commented on Trump's ban from the social media platform, one Facebook post claims to show his reaction.

""Man do I love having this Twitter account, the ability to connect to so many millions of people, to express my feelings and views, to know that all major media outlets and world leaders are reading these words, that they are recorded for posterity. How awesome is that?"" reads a purported screenshot of a tweet from Obama.

The screenshot, which has over 1,000 shares, was shared by the Facebook page Boycott All Things Trump with the caption, ""#ForeverPresident Barack Obama trolls the orange user not to be found.""

The post claims the tweet was shared on Jan. 9 at 6:52 a.m., with 2,000 likes and 250 retweets. The tweet appears to have a blue checkmark and the profile image matches the one seen on Obama's official Twitter profile. However, there is no evidence that the tweet is authentic.

The Facebook page does not have a way to be contacted.

The claim: Obama was confused while introducing Biden at a campaign event

While fans watched former President Barack Obama land a 3-pointer, critics tried to draw attention to another video from the campaign trail.

“A confused Barack Obama yells Joe Biden’s name several times,” according to a video posted Oct. 31 on Instagram by The Gateway Pundit, a conservative outlet.

In the video, Obama shouts, “Joe Biden” three times as he looks offstage and crickets chirp in the background. Distant cheering and music can be heard in choppy moments between Obama’s words and the crickets.

“Barack Obama introduced Joe Biden to the nonexistent crowd and it didn’t go well,” The Gateway Pundit captioned the video.

These choppy moments reveal the video’s audio has been altered to make Obama appear puzzled. This came in the campaign's 11th hour after Biden's Republican opponents spent months pushing the narrative that he is ""sleepy"" and ""senile.""

The Gateway Pundit did not respond to USA TODAY’s request for comment. The video received more than 5,00 likes and dozens of comments.

C-SPAN footage of the drive-in campaign event Oct. 31 in Flint, Michigan, shows the video was altered to give the impression that Obama was confused while waiting for Biden to take the stage.

“We will elect a man who loves this country and who cares about you and who will fight for every single one of us and look out, not just for folks who support him but even the folks who don’t,” Obama said. ""My friend, the next president of the United States of America, Joe Biden! Joe Biden!”

At the 45:38 timestamp of the clip, Stevie Wonder’s “Sir Duke” begins to play, and Biden emerges out of the building behind the stage and jogs to the stage. Obama called, “Joe Biden! Honk if you’re fired up! Honk if you are ready to go! Joe Biden!”

He put the mic down and exited the stage as Biden stepped up to the podium and removed his mask.

“Hello, Flint!” Biden said. “Mr. President, thank you, thank you, thank you! Kind of reminds you of how good it can be listening to him, doesn’t it?”

As “Sir Duke” fades, honks and cheers are audible behind Biden’s speech.

According to USA TODAY, 179 cars attended the drive-in event at Flint Northwestern High School.

Associated Press images of the event show the crowd was socially distanced rather than “nonexistent,” as The Gateway Pundit claims.

USA TODAY has debunked several claims about Biden's small crowds. Despite President Donald Trump’s repeated claims otherwise, USA TODAY found Biden’s small campaign events reflected his campaign’s adherence to social distancing guidelines rather than a lack of popularity.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., arguing that both men understood that activism in the streets needed to be paired with even incremental progress in the political realm.

“If we’re gonna translate our aspirations into laws and practices, we’ve gotta engage in both,” Obama said, referencing a conversation he’d had with Lewis before the congressman’s death this summer.

The former president’s plea comes as Democrats are pulling out all the stops to turn out Black men in Tuesday’s election, part of a key voting bloc that voted in lower numbers in key states that Hillary Clinton lost in 2016.

And the location of Obama’s appeal — in the traditionally red state of Georgia — is one in which Democrats believe they have a real chance to flip from red to blue at both the presidential and Senate levels, and where Black voters are expected to make up a significant chunk of the electorate.

Black voters there were already turning out in record numbers as early voting drew to a close, but President Donald Trump has sought to make inroads with Black men across the country, trying to improve his standing with them even marginally while siphoning away key votes from his opponent, Joe Biden.

“When John Lewis started marching across that bridge, it didn’t eliminate racism and bigotry in America, but it started something that got the Voting Rights Act passed. And it made things better,” Obama said, referring to the infamous 1965 civil rights march in Selma, Ala. Likewise, he added, “I didn’t get everything done that I wanted to get done as president — but I could say when I looked back at the end of eight years, ‘You know what, the country is better off now than it was when I took office.’”

Obama acknowledged that government is “not perfect” and “doesn’t solve every problem,” and admitted that even today he finds himself frustrated with the lack of racial and gender equity or with Trump’s refusal to condemn white supremacist groups.

“I get it,” he said. “But you know what, when I get into one of those moods, I just remind myself that when we work together, when we put in a little bit of effort, things may not get perfect but they do get better.”

Obama made a similar plea earlier this summer when the country was convulsing with unrest following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. He disputed the notion that “voting and participation in electoral politics is a waste of time” and asserted that “real change” on racial injustice starts in the voting booth.

But with the election less than 24 hours away Obama reprised that message in Atlanta.

“The fact that we don’t get 100 percent of what we want is not good enough reason not to vote,” he contended.

Lewis, he argued, “ran for office all those years and kept protesting even while he was in office because he understood they’re two sides of the same coin. It’s us acting on behalf of our highest aspirations even though we know we won’t get there.”

Obama continued, saying that voting is not about “making things perfect, but making things better. Laying that path, brick by brick, to a better future.”"	left
m0nxsy	obama	Obama’s 2015 Selma speech excerpts to be chisled on Obama Presidential Center facade	"WASHINGTON — The words to be chiseled on two sides of the museum tower in the Obama Presidential Center will be from the speech ex-President Barack Obama delivered in Selma to mark the 50th anniversary of civil rights marchers crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge, the foundation announced Sunday.

Obama, the nation’s first Black president, delivered the remarks on March 7, 2015. The foundation chose to unveil a significant and defining architectural detail at the top of the high-rise structure, on the 56th anniversary of what has become known as “Bloody Sunday,” a turning point in civil rights history.

The Selma marchers, including the late Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., who died in July, were beaten on the bridge by state troopers, with the protests eventually leading to the passage of the Voting Rights Act.

In the rendering provided by the foundation, the words appear to be ornamental, floating in a decorative filigree. A foundation official said the words will not be fully readable given the height of the tower.

The foundation posted what will be on the façade:

“You are America. Unconstrained by habit and convention. Unencumbered by what is, ready to seize what ought to be. For everywhere in this country, there are first steps to be taken, there is new ground to cover, there are more bridges to be crossed. America is not the project of any one person. The single most powerful word in our democracy is the word ‘We.’ ‘We The People.’ ‘We Shall Overcome.’ ‘Yes We Can.’ That word is owned by no one. It belongs to everyone. Oh, what a glorious task we are given to continually try to improve this great nation of ours.”

The Chicago Sun-Times compared the excerpt provided by the foundation with the actual speech; the excerpt combines two separate portions of Obama’s remarks.

During Obama’s primary battle with Hillary Clinton, the two rivals were in Selma on March 4, 2007, the 42nd anniversary of the march. Speaking in a church, Obama talked about how he stood on the shoulders of the “Joshua Generation” before him.

In a video released Sunday, Obama reflected on the role Selma played in the voting and civil rights movement and why, of all the speeches he made during his two terms, he and Michelle Obama wanted to highlight his Selma speech in perpetuity.

“Part of the reason why we thought that this excerpt was appropriate to be etched in the building itself is because it speaks to the priorities of the foundation. Our goal is not to just create a monument to my presidency, but rather to describe for anybody who visits how Michelle and I and so many others stood on the shoulders of those who had fought the good fight before us,” he said.

“And hopefully, that then will inspire a new generation of activists. We want them to go through the exhibits and the stories and the images of my presidency and say, “Oh, this is a part of me. This belongs to me.”

Obama museum director Louis Bernard, in a statement on the foundation website, said the letters “will be carved into the structure in such a way that visitors will be able to look out through the words onto the South and West sides of Chicago,” a reference, perhaps, to the Black neighborhoods in the city.

The façade material has not yet been selected.

A foundation official told the Sun-Times, “Given the height of the building and the fact that the screen wraps the western and southern sides at the top of the building, the words/sentences are not intended to be fully “readable,” although certain words or phrases may stand out.

“The full excerpt of the text will be available for all to access at the Center, digitally, and presented in the historical context of Selma to Montgomery and the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday as told in the Museum’s core exhibits.”

Preserving and expanding voting rights is a priority of Democrats, and on Sunday, President Joe Biden, Obama’s vice president, also marking the Selma anniversary, signed an executive order instructing all federal agencies to increase access to voter registration.

Groundbreaking for the complex in Jackson Park will be sometime this year, the foundation earlier announced."	left
lcn6o8	obama	Obama Presidential Center to Break Ground This Summer After Long-Awaited City Approval	"Former President Barack Obama, along with Chicago city officials, announced official plans to break ground on the Obama Presidential Center this summer after a long-awaited approval.

The Barack Obama Foundation is expected to start construction with preliminary work of the center in the second half of 2021, with physical construction likely to begin in August, a release said.

The announcement comes as Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot revealed a years-long review process for city plans supporting the center had been completed.

""With this final step in the review, Chicago is now officially the home of the presidential center for our country’s first Black president,"" Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said. ""The Obama Presidential Center and nearby capital improvement projects will undoubtedly distinguish our city's historic South Side as a world-class economic and cultural hub.""

Obama posted a video to Twitter Wednesday saying their ""hope is that the center will breathe new life into historic Jackson Park while delivering jobs, growth and much more to the South Side.""

I’m proud to announce that the Obama Presidential Center will officially break ground in 2021. Our hope is that the center will breathe new life into historic Jackson Park while delivering jobs, growth, and much more to the South Side.



Let’s get to work. pic.twitter.com/cOqoPmaLkf — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) February 3, 2021

In the social media video, Obama explained why he and Michelle chose to build the center in Chicago, naming his connections to the city.

""From the beginning, Michelle and I knew there was only one place for the Obama Presidential Center: the South Side of Chicago,"" Obama said in the video. ""It's where I met Michelle. Just a couple of miles from where she grew up.""

Obama added that after the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on Chicago's South and West Sides, he said the center will bring jobs and economic opportunity.

The presidential center will put walking trails, playgrounds and bike paths in Chicago's Jackson Park neighborhood, Obama said.

""We know that by working together, we can unlock the South Side's fullest potential and help set up our city, our country and our world for even better years still to come,"" Obama said in the video.

The Chicago Department of Transportation announced a series of transportation adjustments as the center is being built to account for increased ""green space,"" ensure pedestrian safety and improve traffic.

The following roadway segments will be converted into parkland:

Cornell Drive between North Midway Plaisance and Hayes Drive

South Midway Plaisance between Stony Island Avenue and Cornell Drive

Marquette Drive between Stony Island Avenue and Richards Drive

Northbound Cornell Drive from 68th Street to where Cornell Drive becomes two-way

CDOT plans to add several other renovations, such as extra lanes, additional underpasses and more traffic signals, a release said. However, city officials added that traffic around the park will remain generally unchanged even with the adjustments.

The Obama Foundation donated up to $3.5 million to the Chicago Park District for the construction of an artificial turf field, according to a release. The track and field are set to open this summer."	left
khml6a	obama	Barack Obama Reveals ‘The Boys’, ‘The Good Place’ Among Titles In His TV Watchlist	"President Barack Obama shared his television watchlist, which included some of the year’s buzziest and award-winning shows.

In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, where the former POTUS also spoke about the writing process for his latest memoir A Promised Land, Obama revealed that among his favorite shows of the moment are The Boys, The Good Place, Better Call Saul and HBO’s Emmy-winning Watchmen.

“Better Call Saul, because of its great characters and examination of the dark side of the American dream. The Good Place — it’s a wise and sweet combination of goofy comedy and big philosophical questions. And Watchmen and The Boys, for how they turn superhero conventions on their heads to lay bare issues of race, capitalism, and the distorting effects of corporate power and mass media,” Obama said, when asked about the television titles that help him relax. “Oh, and the NBA playoffs — because it’s hoops!”

Not too long after Obama revealed his watch list, cast members and showrunners of the former president’s favorite shows reacted to the praise.

“Ummm. You guys? HOLY. SHIT,” said The Boys showrunner and creator Eric Kripke on Twitter. “Thanks for watching, @BarackObama. If you ever wanna hang out, hit me up in my DM’s. (But seriously this is amazing, THANKS for the shout out)”

The Boys lead actor Jack Quaid also expressed excitement and pride in President Obama’s picks. Antony Starr joined his fellow The Boys team members in celebrating the shout out.

“If the boys is good enough for Obama…it’s good enough,” Starr tweeted.

The Good Place star D’Arcy Carden also shared her reaction to the NBC series being one of the political figure’s favorite titles of the moment, nothing that “The first time I heard @BarackObama liked @nbcthegoodplace I fell to the floor. For real.”

Better Call Saul’s Bob Odenkirk only shared one word to articulate his feelings on social media: “Neat”

Obama's comments were posted on social media following the guilty verdict of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd.

While justice may be done, Obama adds ""we know that true justice is about much more than a single verdict in a single trial. True justice requires that we come to terms with the fact that Black Americans are treated differently, every day. It requires us to recognize that millions of our friends, family, and fellow citizens live in fear that their next encounter with law enforcement could be their last.""

The former president called on Americans to continue to fight for justice.

""We cannot rest. We will need to follow through with the concrete reforms that will reduce and ultimately eliminate racial bias in our criminal justice system,"" his statement said."	left

What he's saying: ""Even as we've battled the pandemic, we've continued to neglect the longer-lasting epidemic of gun violence in America,"" Obama said in a series of Twitter posts.

""Although the shooter’s motive is not yet clear, the identity of the victims underscores an alarming rise in anti-Asian violence that must end,"" he continued, in reference to the fact that six of the eight victims killed in the spa shootings were Asian.

""Yesterday's shootings are another tragic reminder that we have far more work to do to put in place commonsense gun safety laws and root out the pervasive patterns of hatred and violence in our society.""

For the record: Obama has called the failure to pass gun control measures the ""greatest frustration of my presidency."""	left

Here’s Obama’s statement in full:

Our hearts are heavy over yet another shooting of a Black man, Daunte Wright, at the hands of police. The fact that this could happen even as the city of Minneapolis is going through the trial of Derek Chauvin and reliving the heart-wrenching murder of George Floyd indicates not just how important it is to conduct a full and transparent investigation, but also just how badly we need to reimagine policing and public safety in this country.

Michelle and I grieve alongside the Wright family for their loss. We empathize with the pain that Black mothers, fathers, and children are feeling after yet another senseless tragedy. And we will continue to work with all fair-minded Americans to confront historical inequities and bring about nationwide changes that are so long overdue. If you want to help, you can learn about the issues, connect with local and national organizations, find resources on trauma and mental health, and take action here.

Wright, a 20-year-old Black man, was fatally shot by a Brooklyn Center police officer during a traffic stop on Sunday. The city’s police chief said the officer, identified as Kim Potter, meant to use her Taser on Wright but accidentally shot him.

Show Caption Hide Caption Petition calls on White House to label this far-left group terrorists ""Antifa"" is commonly considered to be part of the far-left, a group Trump said was partially responsible for violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. Video provided by Newsy Newslook

The claim: Obama and George Soros created antifa

Does anti-fascist movement antifa have ties to the federal government? A Facebook post referencing an alleged Justice Department investigation makes this claim.

The Feb. 4 post is a screenshot of an apparent article or blog entry titled ""ANTIFA Leads Directly To Barack Obama.""

Former Attorney General William Barr launched an investigation into antifa at the request of former President Donald Trump, according to the claim. Antifa – short for ""anti-fascist"" – is a political protest group without central leadership. Its members engage in counter-demonstrations at far-right wing events and protests, according to the Anti-Defamation League.

""ANTIFA is the creation of Barack Obama and George Soros,"" the claim states. ""And it is even partially funded with taxpayer money, something that will be coming to a swift end.""

USA TODAY reached out to the poster for comment.

Related fact checks:

Barr started an anti-government extremist task force

The Task Force on Violent Anti-Government Extremists was created to investigate perpetrators of violent acts amid peaceful protests in the wake of George Floyd's death, USA TODAY reported in June.

A memo about the task force released June 26 named the far-right wing ""boogaloo"" movement and antifa. At the time, members of antifa were not identified among the suspects, USA TODAY reported. The task force was referenced in a Sept. 4 press release about the arrest of two ""Boogaloo Bois"" for attempting to provide support to a foreign terrorist organization.

USA TODAY reached out to the Justice Department for an update on the task force.

Despite Barr's initiative, there is no evidence suggesting the Justice Department discovered an illicit connection between former President Barack Obama and philanthropist George Soros.

Claim has origins in satire

The screenshot in the Facebook post is of the headline and first paragraph of an article from Obamawatcher.com. The blog is a parody site that hosts satirical content, according to an ""About us"" page.

Obamawatcher's ""Kraven Moorehead"" wrote that Barr's lead investigator, Joseph Barron, found Soros recruited Obama to help create antifa in exchange for funding the former president's senatorial and presidential campaigns. Soros, a Hungarian businessman and investor, is a prolific donor to the Democratic Party, according to the BBC.

The writer admitted the story was a satirical fabrication at the end of the article.

""Billions of dollars were flowing into the coffers of ANTIFA, the 'grassroots' movement of liberals and leftists. The completely made-up scenario from the president and his supporters was finally coming together,"" he wrote. ""While Trump hid out in the bunker, Barron concluded that the entire thing was much ado about nothing. It was just… Obama’s fault. That’s what he would tell him.""

The Facebook claim's satirical origins were not noted on the screenshot or in the post caption.

Our rating: False

We rate this claim FALSE, based on our research. A Facebook post suggesting anti-fascist group antifa was created by former President Barack Obama and Democratic donor George Soros is derived from a work of satire. The article referenced in the claim is clearly labeled satire on its website of origin, but not in the Facebook post.

jz0hx4	obama	Barack Obama: ‘Donald Trump and I tell very different stories about America’	"If you’re a former US president, there’s one guaranteed way to be remembered fondly – make sure you’re followed by a truly awful successor. It certainly worked for Barack Obama: you only had to mention his name these last four years to send millions of Americans (and others) into a reverie of nostalgic longing. The gulf in calibre between Donald Trump and his predecessor was so wide that each day Trump sat in the Oval Office, Obama’s reputation shone a little brighter.

Not that he needed the comparison. Even before Trump took office, Obama left the White House with unusually high approval ratings: 59% of Americans thought well of him, according to Gallup – and that figure has held ever since. Outside the US, Obama recently displaced Bill Gates as the world’s most admired man, according to YouGov, which is handy as Obama is married to the world’s most admired woman.

If you had to construct the unTrump, Barack Obama is what you’d come up with: cerebral and well-read; deliberative; self-critical to the point of self-doubt; a faithful husband and conspicuously devoted father. He was a chief executive whose team was so functional that, over the course of eight years, there was scarcely a leak; not a single person was forced to resign in disgrace, let alone face legal proceedings. The closest the Obama White House got to scandal was when he wore a pale “tan” suit in 2014, a look some considered unpresidential. Not for nothing did they call him “no drama Obama”.

If you had to construct the unTrump, Obama is what you’d come up with: cerebral, well-read and self-critical

There is much to criticise in his record, whether it be a covert drone war that saw 10 times the number of strikes as were authorised under George W Bush, resulting in the loss of as many as 800 civilian lives in Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen – or a failure to enforce his supposed “red line” on the use of chemical weapons in Syria, a failure that Bashar al-Assad seemed to read as a licence to keep killing his own people. You can criticise Obama for failing to do enough for small-town and postindustrial America, so that people who had voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012 voted for Trump in 2016. Still, and even taking all that into account, from the vantage point of 2020 the Obama presidency looks like a calm, flat sea before the roiling tempest of Trump.

The outgoing president features only a little in Obama’s 751-page memoir, A Promised Land, which covers the period from the author’s entry into politics – winning a seat in the state senate of Illinois in 1995 – until the moment that may have ensured his re-election: the killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011. A second volume will address the rest. The book is written in the same voice that made Dreams From My Father a bestseller, letting the reader in on the author’s inner monologue – as Obama observes his own life as it plays out, questioning his motivations, noticing his hypocrisies.

Trump’s cameo role is that of villain, the lead proponent of “birtherism”, spreading the racist smear that Obama was not really born in the US, “a conspiracy theory he almost certainly knew to be false,” Obama writes. Trump also makes an appearance as the butt of Obama’s jokes on the fateful night in 2011 when, delivering the traditional comic turn at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, the president mocked Trump as a man whose idea of an important decision was choosing between the boys’ and girls’ teams on Celebrity Apprentice. Was it that humiliation that stung Trump into seeking the presidency, just to get even?

Had this month’s election gone the other way, the publication of Obama’s book would have been tinged with melancholy, even futility. He would have been celebrating a legacy that was halfway to being dismantled. For if the Trump presidency had a defining theme, it was its obsessive desire to destroy the record of Barack Obama. Trump pulled out of the Paris climate accords and Iran nuclear deal, both brokered by Obama; he itched to destroy the Obamacare reforms to health provision. Doubtless, he will try to get more of that work of erasure done in his remaining weeks in office, between now and January 20. But armed with a second term, Trump would have had four years to finish the job.

Now Joe Biden will undo that undoing. He’s promised to reverse some of Trump’s reverses the day he takes office: rejoining the Paris accords and the World Health Organization, for example. Biden-Harris may not amount to a third term of Obama-Biden, but it will ensure the first two are not erased.

Thanks to the pandemic, there was to be no face-to-face interview with the Guardian, not even by Zoom. Instead, as befits a writer – especially one who likes to keep control – the former president opted for an exchange on the page: written questions, written answers. Of course there are a thousand things anyone would want to ask him. Is the book called A Promised Land because he feels he never quite got there? Did he waste the power he had when he had it, by trying to compromise with Republicans who never had any interest in meeting him halfway – but instead wanted to hobble him from the start? Did he let the bankers culpable for the crash of 2008 off too lightly?

Obama chose which questions to answer, opting perhaps for those designed not to catch him out but to encourage him to open up. That would fit: if Trump relishes the combative shoutiness of Twitter, Obama has always been a bit more Instagram – curated and personable. The 44th US president doesn’t much like talking about the 45th, but Trump is present all the same, between the lines. Obama suggests that he and Trump were telling duelling stories about America. Now, at the very moment Trump’s story has been rejected and cut short, Obama has a new chance to tell his.

From fake news to the climate crisis: the view from the Oval Office

Are you a writer who became a politician, rather than a politician who’s done some writing?

Great question. Because the truth is, in a lot of ways, the job of a writer and the job of a politician overlap. Both are trying to tell a story that connects with folks. I mean, Donald Trump and I ran on very different stories about what America is all about, but you can’t say either of us didn’t tell a story.

As a writer, you are also better able to avoid some of the pitfalls that politicians encounter. For example, there’s a temptation, in politics, to talk about voters in broad categories: white voters and Black voters, Democrats and Republicans, hockey moms and soccer moms. Those categories can give us some understanding of people’s lives, but they don’t show us what’s happening inside – their complexities and contradictions. When you’re a writer, your job is all about figuring out how to show your readers that interior life. I think that’s a perspective we could use more of in our politics.

You write that for your aides, David Plouffe, David Axelrod and Robert Gibbs, “the immediate formula for racial progress was simple – we needed to win” in 2008. Given all that we saw this summer, were they – were we – naive in thinking that the act of electing the first Black president might ease America’s racial pain?

Obviously, we have a long way to go on race in this country. You won’t find a quote from me, or my aides, saying that my election would somehow usher in a post-racial society. But I also don’t want to undersell the fact that there is a generation of kids out there who would turn on the TV and see a president who looked like them – with a cabinet and a staff by his side that reflected the fuller palette of our country’s diversity. And, by the way, that didn’t just have an impact on African American kids. It had an impact on white kids, too, who will enter the world knowing it’s not unusual for a person of color to be in a leadership position.

This makes me feel old to say, but the reality is that those kids – kids from every background who grew up when I was president – have already done so much to move our country forward. They’re the ones who took to the streets this summer to lead the fight for racial justice. And now, our roles are reversed: they’re the ones on my television set, inspiring me.

In the book, you describe repeatedly being on the end of campaigns of deliberate disinformation – whether about your birth certificate or healthcare plan. Now that conspiracy theories have become mainstream, how vulnerable is truth, and what can it do to fight back?

Well, the truth is the truth. Some people just think it’s in their interest to lie about it. Sometimes it works, especially on social media where you’ll trust something you hear from a friend or an uncle or an outlet that tells you what you want to hear, but you’ll shut out a fact-checker from a publication you’ve been told is slanted against you. The term “information bubbles” sometimes belies the danger: without a baseline of broadly shared facts, democracy is going to be in constant crisis.

‘As a president, you learn what you can’t do on your own.’ Photograph: Pari Dukovic

There’s no one solution here. It’s a complicated knot that’s going to take a while to get untangled. These conspiracy theories can take on a life of their own online, and platforms haven’t quite figured out how to grapple with them. They’re always playing catch-up – trying to stamp out the lie after it’s out in the ether. And when people and media companies who should know better don’t disavow or distance themselves from these obvious conspiracy theories, folks don’t know what to think. So all of us have a role to play in bringing us back toward a common set of facts – elected leaders, tech companies, the media, our education system and all of us as citizens.

You played golf as well as some basketball with your aides – but were there times when even you could not unwind? How do you recharge?

Golf was a big help. The truth is, when you’re president, it’s one of the only ways you can consistently get fresh air.

I also made sure to recharge every evening at 6.30pm when I would have dinner with Michelle, Sasha and Malia. We’d eat some good meals and catch up on our days. That was one of the best parts of living above the store, as I liked to call it. I could spend quality time with my family every night, even if that meant that I needed to go back to work after dinner.

The reality is, for better or worse, I’m a pretty steady guy. And over the course of my time in politics, whether I was dealing with losing New Hampshire during the primary or the bottom was falling out of the economy, I found that I was often my most level-headed when things were going to hell.

You close your book with a meditation on a question that nagged at you after the success of the operation to catch Osama bin Laden: was it only possible to muster that “unity of effort” when the goal involved killing a terrorist? You go on to say that there has not been a similar focus on the climate crisis. You made a breakthrough in Paris – but in terms of the climate, what didn’t you achieve and why? Is it the case that even someone in the most powerful job in the world can only do so much?

You know, when I was writing that passage, I wasn’t just lamenting politics as it is. I was imagining politics as it could be. What would happen, I wondered, if we could rally that kind of energy and unity to educate our children or eliminate homelessness? What might the country feel like if we could stir enough passion to eliminate greenhouse gases or reduce poverty?

I joke in the book that my staff would have laughed at this idea for being too utopian – and look, I recognize it’s a far cry from the politics we have today. But the reality is, an issue like climate change isn’t going to be solved by only one party – or even by only one country.

That’s one of the lessons you learn as president, over and over again: you learn what you can’t do on your own. Whether you’re trying to make a difference domestically or internationally, you need to build coalitions, invest in relationships, find ways to work together. That’s how we rallied the world to confront Ebola before it became a pandemic like we’re seeing now.

And it’s why Paris was such a big deal. With that agreement, pretty much the entire world recognized climate change as a problem and committed to being a part of the solution. And that’s why I am so heartened Joe Biden will be rejoining the agreement as president.

Now, do I think rejoining Paris is all we need to do to combat climate change? Of course not. We need to make massive investments in clean energy, clean transportation and resilient agriculture. We need to ramp up research and development into new technologies that will create jobs and reduce our dependence on carbon. I can go on and on. But at the end of the day, this challenge will only be solved when leaders from across oceans and the political spectrum step up to the plate."	left
mf67c9	obama	Why former President Barack Obama picked Joe Biden as his VP in 2008: 'We couldn't have been more different'	"When you're choosing a key employee, a partner in an important project, or even a potential boss, what traits should you seek out?

Former U.S. President Barack Obama has some great insights on this question. In his memoir, ""A Promised Land,"" he details the qualities that led him to choose current President Joe Biden as his running mate in his 2008 campaign.

They were both Democratic senators, but other than that, Obama writes, ""we couldn't have been more different."" Obama was born in Hawaii and had lived in Indonesia. Biden was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania and spent most of his life in Delaware.

Obama was cerebral and reserved, later nicknamed ""No-Drama Obama."" Biden was ""all warmth"" and talkative. Obama was running as a newcomer to politics; Biden had been in the Senate for 35 years. Obama is supremely disciplined in all his public communications, whereas Biden, Obama observes, is a ""man without inhibitions, happy to share whatever popped into his head.""

Perhaps most significant of all, there was another potential candidate in the mix, Virginia senator Tim Kaine, who later became Hillary Clinton's running mate. Obama and Kaine were good friends, had similar resumes, and, Obama writes, similar temperaments. Kaine had also been an early key supporter of Obama's campaign and worked hard for him, while Biden had run against him. There were so many good reasons to choose Kaine.

Why pick Biden instead?

The decision was, in part, a political calculation. Obama and his advisors thought people who were uncomfortable voting for a relative newcomer would be reassured by the presence of such a senior senator on the ticket.

But there was a lot more to it than that. As he got to know Biden, Obama discovered qualities he knew made Biden the right choice — and they are qualities that everyone should consider when choosing someone to be on your team:"	left
lrklv4	obama	Bruce Springsteen and Barack Obama Talk Racism, Clarence Clemons, Protest Songs and ‘Get Out’ for Spotify Podcast	"Bruce Springsteen and Barack Obama talk extensively about issues of race in the first two episodes of their joint Spotify podcast, “Renegades: Born in the USA,” both released this week. The two discuss the racism the former president experienced growing up in Hawaii, Springsteen’s on- and off-stage relationships with Clarence Clemons, and how little has changed since the rocker released the song “41 Shots (American Skin)” two decades ago… along with nods to the films “Do the Right Thing” and “Get Out.”

Early in episode 2, “American Skin: Race in the United States,” Obama brings up the subject of the E Street Band being racially integrated — although he didn’t know just how diverse the lineup was in the early days, with three white members and three Black ones, before the group got streamlined to the point that Clemons became the sole Black face in the band.

“I didn’t know that, you know, you got a half Black, half white band,” says Obama. “I didn’t know that because look, I hate to date you, brother, but ‘Born to Run,’ I was still…”

“You were a child,” laughs Springsteen.

Not quite; he was in high school. But, Obama points out, ” I knew the Average White Band was all white… Those are some Scottish guys. And those guys can jam, by the way.” (“Yes, they could,” Springsteen agrees of the “Cut the Cake” crew.)

A considerable amount of time is devoted to Clemons, with Obama noting that the moments Springsteen shared on the road each night with his late, celebrated sax player were “like a buddy movie on stage.” The ex-prez wonders how intentional their interracial charisma was designed to be.

“It both happened naturally and we contrived (it) together at some point, you know, Clarence and I,” Springsteen says. “There was a moment when I say, ‘Hey C, you know, tomorrow night when I go to the front of the stage and I play this, come on up with me and play it next to me.’ And we took those steps the next night.”

Looking at the broader picture, the rocker says, “There was an idealism in our partnership where I always felt our audience looked at us and saw the America that they wanted… wanted to see and wanted to believe in. And this became the biggest story I ever told. I’ve never written a song that told a bigger story than Clarence and I standing next to each other on any of the 1,001 nights that we played. He lent his power to my story, like I said, the story that we told together, which… was about the distance between the American Dream and the American reality.”

Picking up on Springsteen’s aside that Clemons was about eight years older than he was, Obama says, “Look, here’s an older Black man that’s been hustling out there for a long time… He’s gotta hook up with a young white teen…”

“A little skinny white kid, you know?” agrees Springsteen.

“Who is less experienced than him. Now, it works out beautifully for the both of you… But there’s also complications, right, to that whole relationship? And I don’t know if you guys ever talked about it.”

“He had to give a little more than I had to give in the sense that once our keyboardist and drummer left… he was the only Black man in the room a lot of the time. He had to swim in white culture for most of his work life.” Springsteen goes on to reminisce about how, on the Amnesty International tour in the late 1980s, they did a gig on the Ivory Coast and played to an all-Black crowd, at which point Clemons came over and whispered on stage, “Well, now you know how it feels.”

In talking about the aftermath of the George Floyd killing, Springsteen quotes James Baldwin, which leads Obama to finally quote Jordan Peele.

The former president says that latent racism, “depending on the community you’re in, how far near the surface it is, is not always clear. And I think a lot of Black folks always talk about how what’s hardest is not dealing with a Klansman. That you know. ​That you can figure out. You are prepared and you are geared up. What cuts is people who you know aren’t bad people, and the fact that that card is still in their pocket and that at some unexpected moment it might be played is heartbreaking. Because that’s where you realize, ‘Oh, this is a deep, big piece of business’ and it’s not a matter or not using racial epitaphs and it’s not just a matter of, you know, voting for Barack Obama. That’s why that movie… Did you see the movie ​’Get Out’?”

“I did,” says Springsteen, laughing at what he knows is coming.

“So when the father who turns out to be crazy starts saying, ‘Man, I’d vote for Obama a third time!’ — I mean that’s part of the point that that line is making,” says the man who figured into that punchline.

The two figures speak about activism, and how it can be all right if it goes beyond their own expectations of decorum in politics.

Obama says that “as long as protests and activism doesn’t veer into violence, my general latitude is, I want and expect young people to push those boundaries and to to test and try the patience of their parents and their grandparents… I remind young activists that I meet with, I said, ‘Look, if you want my advice about how you can get a law passed or get enough votes to put in power people, I can give you some practical advice. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that that should be your goal. Sometimes your goal may just be to…”

“Stir shit up,” Springsteen suggests with a laugh.

“Stir shit up,” Obama agrees. “And open up new possibilities… Even though I was convinced that reparations was a non-starter during my presidency. I understand the argument of people I respect, like Ta-Nehisi Coates, yhat we should talk about it anyway. if for no other reason to educate the country about a past that too often isn’t taught… and let’s face it, we’d rather forget.”

They address the protests on the far other end of the scale — as Springsteen puts it, “the marching with the polo shirts with your tiki torches. I thought that that was kind of over, you know?”

“Yeah, you thought we weren’t debating Nazism anymore?” laughs Obama. “You thought that was settled back in ‘45.”

Obama introduces a “lightning round” in the conversation: protest songs. Springsteen first brings up “Fight the Power” by Public Enemy, followed by the Sex Pistols’ “Anarchy in the UK” and “God Save the Queen.” Obama’s picks are Bob Dylan’s “Maggie’s Farm,” Sam Cookie’s “A Change is Gonna Come,” Billie Holiday’s “Strange Fruit” (“Boom. To the top of the list,” agrees Springsteen) and, “although people don’t think of it as a protest song,” Aretha Franklin’s “Respect.”

And then there is one of Springsteen’s own: “41 Shots,” about the shooting of African immigrant Amadou Diallo, cut down by 19 hits to the body from 41 shots fired for reaching for his wallet. “This incident occurs and I start to think about it and I go, ‘OK, skin. Skin is destiny.’ It’s like, what a privilege it is to forget that you live in a particular body.”

“Did you get any kind of reaction after you wrote that?” Obama asks.

“There was some booing,” Springsteen admits. “We took a lot of heat from the police… for several years after that. There were some police officers giving us the New Jersey state bird, which I always felt was a result of not listening to it, really. You know?… If you listen to it, it never felt fundamentally controversial. It wasn’t a diatribe. It wasn’t a finger-pointing song particularly, you know? It just tried to tally up the human cost in what we all pay for in blood of those kinds of killings and murders that go on day after day. I mean this song is 20 years old. This song is 20 years old.”

Rob DeMartin

Back on the subject of Clemons, Springsteen tells a story of hanging out with Clemons in the neighborhood, pre-stardom, and seeing some of the sax player’s supposed friends call him the N-word to his face, which the musician admits he was too flummoxed to respond to at the time.

Obama relates a similar story, recounted in his first memoir, about having one of his basketball playing friends direct the C-word racial epithet at him.

“Now first of all, ain’t no c—s in Hawaii, right?” laughs Obama. “It’s one of those things that where he might not even known what a coon was. What he knew was, “I can hurt you by saying this.’ … And I remember I popped him in the face and broke his nose and we were in the locker room.” (“Well done,” interjects Springsteen.) “And suddenly blood is pouring down. And it was just reactive… And he said, ‘Why’d you do that?’ And I explained to him – I said, ‘Don’t you ever call me something like that… But the point is that what it comes down to is… an assertion of status over the other. right?

“The claim is made that ‘No matter what I am… I may be poor. I may be ignorant. I may be mean. I may be ugly. I may not like myself. I may be unhappy. But you know what I’m not? I’m not you.‘ And that basic psychology that then gets institutionalized is used to justify dehumanizing somebody, taking advantage of ‘em, cheating ‘em, stealing from ‘em, killing ‘em, raping ‘em… And in some cases it’s as simple as, you know, ‘I’m scared I’m insignificant and not important. And this thing is the thing that’s going to give me some importance.'”

Says Springsteen, addressing Obama, “When I first saw you, you spoke to a broad sense of American hopefulness. And there was something in Clarence’s presence of that quality, and it’s what made our band so powerful when we came to your town at night. We addressed all these issues. We didn’t speak necessarily directly about them… But that partnership was just real, you know? I was at (Clemons’) bedside when he took his last breath and… he was such a strong figure for me.”

“You miss him. You loved him,” says Obama.

“It was 45 years of your life you don’t… it’s never something that comes again. You know? Forty-five years. And the only thing we never kidded ourselves about was that race didn’t matter. We lived together. We traveled throughout the United States, and we were probably as close as two people could be. Yet at the same time, I always had to recognize there was a part of Clarence that I wasn’t ever really going to exactly know… It was a relationship unlike any other that I’ve ever had in my life.”

In episode 1, the two discuss the commonalities in their personalities despite their disparate career paths — and the difficulty sometimes in distinguishing altruism from ego.

“The same issues that you struggle with have been issues I’ve struggled with,” says the former president. “The same joys and doubts. You know, it turns out there’s a lot of overlap… In the same way that a musician is looking for a way to channel and work through pain, demons, personal question, you know, that was certainly true for me in terms of getting into public life.”

“But you’ve gotta have two things going, which is very difficult,” says Springsteen. “One, you’ve got to have the egotism to believe that…”

“The megalomania,” corrects Obama.

“The megalomania,” agrees Springsteen, “OK, to believe that you have a voice, and a point of view that is worth being heard by the whole world… On one hand you need that type of megalomania, and yet on the other hand… for it to be true… for it to have the kind of impact that you’ve had… you’ve got to have the tremendous empathy for other people.”

“It’s a hard trick to pull off.,” says Obama. “You start off with ego, but then at some point you empty out and become a vessel for the hopes and dreams and stories…”

“At your best, yeah,” Springsteen says.

lpuhe4	obama	Spotify Launches Barack Obama, Bruce Springsteen Podcast	"Barack Obama sat down with Bruce Springsteen for a series of wide-ranging conversations that will hit Spotify as an exclusive original podcast — the newest entry in the company’s expanding slate of audio programming.

“Renegades: Born in the USA” is an eight-episode podcast featuring the former president and The Boss, who have been friends for over a decade, “in deep and revealing conversation,” according to Spotify. In the show, the duo discuss topics spanning race, fatherhood, marriage, and the state of America.

Starting Monday (Feb. 22), the first two episodes of “Renegades” will be available exclusively on Spotify worldwide. More info on the series is available on Higher Ground’s hub on Spotify at this link.

The Obama/Springsteen “Renegades” series is the second original podcast for Spotify under the company’s exclusive deal with Barack and Michelle Obama’s Higher Ground. “The Michelle Obama Podcast” hit the streaming service last summer, and according to Spotify had the biggest debut of any original to date. The premiere episode featured Barack as Michelle’s first guest.

According to Higher Ground, Barack Obama and Springsteen first met on the campaign trail in 2008 and have “formed a deep friendship since.” On the “Renegades” podcast, they talk about their hometowns and role models, modern manhood, and the divided state of America today and how we can all move forward together.

“On the surface, Bruce and I don’t have a lot in common,” Barack Obama says in the intro to the first episode. “But over the years, what we’ve found is that we’ve got a shared sensibility — about work, about family and about America.”

He continues, “In our own ways, Bruce and I have been on parallel journeys trying to understand this country that’s given us both so much. Trying to chronicle the stories of its people. Looking for a way to connect our own individual searches for meaning and truth and community with the larger story of America.”

In addition to its multiyear pact with Spotify, Higher Ground has an exclusive production agreement with Netflix for scripted films, TV series, children’s programs and documentaries. The company’s first release, “American Factory” won the 2019 Academy Award for documentary feature.

Separately, Springsteen earlier this month was involved in a controversy over a report that he was arrested for DUI in November, which prompted Jeep to pull its recent Super Bowl ad featuring the singer from YouTube.

Spotify announced the Barack Obama-Springsteen podcast at its Stream On event Monday. Other podcast-related news from the event:

Spotify announced a multiyear deal with Anthony and Joe Russo’s AGBO production company for exclusive podcast content from the creators behind films including “Avengers: Infinity War” and “Avengers: End Game.”

Spotify will launch a podcast from Ava DuVernay focused on social change and cases of police brutality, based on ARRAY’s Law Enforcement Accountability Project, which launched after the murder of George Floyd.

The company is bringing out a second season of Higher Ground’s “Tell Them, I Am,” a collection of narratives from Muslim voices hosted by Pakistani-American podcaster Misha Euceph. A new episode will premiere every weekday during Ramadan, looking at the lives of 22 people from all over the world.

The Warner Bros./DC deal for original podcasts for Spotify will include stories about characters including Superman, Lois Lane, Wonder Woman, Joker, Catwoman, Katana, The Riddler, Batgirl and Harley Quinn, according to Jim Lee, DC’s chief creative officer. The first podcast under the companies’ pact, “Batman Unburied,” from executive producer David S. Goyer, will be released on Spotify later this year.

The company sketched out plans for the Spotify Audience Network, which will let marketers buy advertising inventory across Spotify originals and exclusives; podcasts via Megaphone and Anchor; and ad-supported music.

Spotify said it will begin testing the ability for podcasters to earn revenue through paid subscriptions for fan-only content on the platform.

mpkalc	obama	Analysis: Biden strengthens Obama's legacy while seeking his own	"(CNN) With sweeping economic recovery plans, President Joe Biden seeks his own legacy like the New Deal or Great Society. But he's also bolstering Barack Obama's.

In multiple ways, Biden has used his first 100 days to reinforce the battered foundations of Obamacare. He exercised executive authority to invite more of the uninsured to buy Affordable Care Act coverage , expanded marketing to encourage them and provided larger premium subsidies as part of his $1.9 trillion Covid relief legislation.

For its original architects, who spent the last four years watching then-President Donald Trump and fellow Republicans try to wither and wipe out Obama's signature program, it represents a deeply satisfying revival.

""It does need to be shored up and strengthened,"" observed Nancy-Ann DeParle, a principal health adviser to Obama as the ACA was created. ""President Biden and Vice President Harris said they were going to do it, and they're doing it.""

For obvious reasons, Biden holds a strong stake in the program's success. As vice president, he too was present at the program's creation, famously whispering in Obama's ear that fulfilling the Democratic Party's decades-old wish for a national health plan represented a ""big f------ deal.""

In the 2020 campaign, Biden resisted calls from primary rivals and the Democratic left to embrace a ""Medicare for All"" single-payer system to replace the ACA. But his health care agenda extended beyond simply reinforcing Obama's existing structure.

He proposed to make Medicare available to a large new swath of Americans by dropping the age of eligibility to 60 from 65. And he called for a new Medicare-style ""public option,"" available even to those offered health insurance coverage by their employers.

Both those proposals face stiff political headwinds in Congress, especially with the White House making massive economic recovery spending on physical infrastructure and other priorities the focus of its current legislative push. Meanwhile, Biden used the Covid relief bill to make a big health-policy down payment.

The steps it included could help extend coverage to more than one-third of the 29 million Americans currently without health insurance, according to Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation. In addition to expanding the breadth and depth of subsidies for the purchase of Obamacare policies, the Covid relief bill extended huge new financial incentives for states to expand their Medicaid programs under provisions of the ACA.

Expansion under Obamacare extends Medicaid coverage to those with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty level. Twelve states -- 10 of which Trump carried in both his presidential campaigns -- have resisted doing so since the ACA was enacted in 2010.

If all 12 accepted Biden's new incentives to expand, roughly 4 million people could gain insurance under Medicaid. None has accepted so far. In Missouri, the Republican-controlled legislature is blocking implementation of Medicaid expansion even after state voters passed a ballot measure expanding Medicaid last year

But Biden and his outside allies haven't given up. The liberal advocacy group Protect Our Care has launched a public campaign to pressure ""GOP Medicaid Deniers,"" while health policy experts close to the administration explore alternatives if the holdouts persist.

""We've got to find a way to get this group covered,"" said Sharon Parrott, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

And DeParle predicted the Biden administration ""will be very creative"" about overcoming lingering resistance.

Later this month, the second part of Biden's economic recovery agenda -- an ""American Families Plan"" to help struggling families climb the economic ladder -- may sketch out an approach. One possibility under discussion: a limited-purpose public insurance option for those stuck in the holdout states' ""Medicaid coverage gap.""

The expanded premium subsidies in the Covid relief bill last only two years. The White House wants to make them permanent, but that requires additional legislation.

Nor has Biden yet eliminated an existential legal threat to Obamacare. The Supreme Court, reshaped by three Trump-appointed justices, has not yet ruled on a lawsuit by Republican-led states that seeks to declare the ACA unconstitutional.

But many legal experts expect the court to once again uphold the law. Chief Justice John Roberts and Trump appointee Brett Kavanaugh suggested as much during oral arguments last November.

Public support for the law has actually risen during its extended legal and political trial by fire. After Trump and the Republican-led Congress nearly repealed it in 2017, voters handed Democrats the House in 2018 and then full control of Congress and the White House in 2020.

Under Biden's protection now, Obama's legacy achievement appears likely to remain a durable feature of the American landscape. Invoking an earlier generation's television commercial for a watch, DeParle concluded: ""Takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin'."""	left
m8lwae	obama	Barack Obama on Talking With Malia and Sasha About Toxic Masculinity	"As the former president of the United States, Barack Obama has a pretty clear idea of what America expects from men in our culture. Our often narrow views of masculinity not only influence the celebrities we idolize, but also permeate the policies we champion and the political representation we see.

Now, in the upcoming episode of Obama and Bruce Springsteen's Spotify podcast ""Renegades: Born in the USA,"" the two sit down to dissect their own views of manhood, including influences from their fathers and the world at-large.

In an exclusive episode clip provided to ELLE.com, Obama reveals the conversations he's had with his daughters, Sasha and Malia, about toxic masculinity. ""I talk to my daughters' friends about boys growing up, and so much of popular culture tells them that the only clear, defining thing about being a man, being masculine, is you excel in sports and sexual conquest,"" he said. ""And violence, right? Those are the three things, and violence, if it’s healthy at least, is subsumed into sports. Later, you add to that definition, making money, right? How much money can you make?""

Obama told Springsteen that there are some qualities of a ""traditional American man"" that are worthy of praise and emulation: a sense of responsibility and being willing to make sacrifices for your family and future generations. ""But there is a bunch of stuff in there that we did not reckon with,"" he continued. ""And now you’re seeing with Me Too, part of what we’re dealing with in terms of women still seeking equal pay, part of what we’re still dealing with in terms of domestic abuse and violence. There was never a full reckoning of ... who our dads were, what they had in them, how we have to understand that and talk about that, what lessons we should learn from it. All that kind of got buried.""

m74yca	obama	Obama Calls For End To Anti-Asian Violence After Shootings At Massage Spas	"Police arrested 21-year-old Robert Aaron Long of Woodstock, Georgia, in connection with the shootings on Tuesday night.

He was arrested as he began driving toward Florida, where investigators say he may have been planning to carry out more attacks.

“This could have been significantly worse,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said Wednesday morning at a news conference. “It is very likely that there would have been more victims.”

Long told police he had “sexual addiction” issues and targeted the spas to “take out that temptation,” said Capt. Jay Baker, spokesman for the Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office.

Although investigators stopped short of declaring the attacks a hate crime, violence against Asian Americans has been on the rise since the COVID-19 pandemic began.

“Yesterday’s shooting are another tragic reminder that we have far more work to do to put in place commonsense gun safety laws and root out the pervasive patterns or hatred and violence in our society,” Obama said in his statement. “Michelle and I pray for the victims, their families, everyone grieving these needless and devastating killings―and we urge meaningful action that will save lives.”"	left

The conversation will be made available for free and debut on Tuesday, Nov. 17 on Apple TV+, the same day as the memoir's long-awaited release.

""This book was worth the wait,"" Winfrey said in a statement. ""Everybody who reads it is going to be on this journey from the grueling and monotonous grind of the campaign, to taking us inside the Oval Office and the Cabinet Room and the Situation Room and sometimes, even the bedroom. This book has both the intimacy and the grandeur coming through in this memoir, and I have so been looking forward to speaking with him about all of it.""

""There's no feeling like finishing a book, and I'm proud of this one,"" Obama wrote in a September tweet. ""In 'A Promised Land,' I try to provide an honest accounting of my presidency, the forces we grapple with as a nation, and how we can heal our divisions and make democracy work for everybody.""

Obama recently revealed, however, that her vast culinary knowledge doesn't quite extend to her husband, former president Barack Obama.

In a new interview with E!'s Daily Pop, the former First Lady shared that her husband has three core meals he makes for their family, but that cooking isn't a part of the president's daily repertoire.

""He came cooking,"" Mrs. Obama told E! of when she first met her husband, ""but he had like, sort of, his three recipes.""

According to Obama, her husband's signature dishes include ""a mean chili, a good stir-fry, and great omelets. So, he had kind of his … wheelhouse. He stayed in that lane, you know? But he could cook.""

Mrs. Obama's love of food did manage to transfer to her two daughters, Malia, 22, and Sasha, 19, however. The former First Lady revealed to People earlier this month that her girls have become ""midnight bakers"" amid quarantining with their parents.

""They were baking way too much at the beginning of quarantine, too many delicious pies. They were good at it! Good pie crust, good fillings,"" revealed Obama. ""So at 1 in the morning, you'd smell cinnamon buns baking. I had to tell them to stop because we can't have all those sweets.""

“After a year that has tested us in unimaginable ways, we've seen how people from all walks of life have stepped up to create change to make things better,” the former Democratic president wrote.

Obama then shared an article published by The Washington Post Friday describing how a group of prison inmates pooled money together to help a high school student pay for his tuition at the private Catholic school he attended.

k0ydfm	obama	Obama: Republicans portraying white men as 'victims' helped Trump win votes	"Barack Obama said part of the reason 73 million Americans voted to re-elect Donald Trump in the election was because of messaging from Republicans that the country, particularly white men, are under attack.

In an interview with the radio show the Breakfast Club on Wednesday to promote his new memoir A Promised Land, Obama said Trump’s administration, which he did not name directly, “objectively has failed, miserably, in handling just basic looking after the American people and keeping them safe”, and yet he still secured millions of votes.

“What’s always interesting to me is the degree to which you’ve seen created in Republican politics the sense that white males are victims,” Obama said. “They are the ones who are under attack – which obviously doesn’t jive with both history and data and economics. But that’s a sincere belief, that’s been internalized, that’s a story that’s being told and how you unwind that is going to be not something that is done right away.”

Later, one of the show’s hosts, DJ Envy, asked Obama how he responds to criticism from Black people and other communities of color who don’t believe he did enough for them as president.

“I understand it because when I was elected there was so much excitement and hope, and I also think we generally view the presidency as almost like a monarchy in the sense of once the president’s there, he can just do whatever needs to get done and if he’s not doing it, it must be because he didn’t want to do it,” Obama said.

Envy challenged Obama, making the case that Trump has behaved in exactly that way.

“Because he breaks laws or disregards the constitution,” Obama said. “The good news for me was I was very confident in what I had done for Black folks because I have the statistics to prove it.”

Obama continued to highlight how his policies saw Black people’s incomes rise, poverty drop and access to healthcare increase.

“The issue is sometimes we just didn’t go around advertising that because again the goal here is to build coalitions where everybody is getting something so they all feel like they have a stake in it,” Obama said. “But a lot of my policies were targeted towards people most in need. Those folks are disproportionately African American.”

Obama also spoke about the role of the public and Congress in making change. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, blocked much of the Obama administration’s efforts in the Republican-controlled Senate in the final years of his presidency.

A similar fate could be awaiting President-elect Joe Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris, Obama warned. It is unknown which party will control the Senate until the results are in from two runoff elections in Georgia scheduled for 5 January.

“If the Republicans win those two seats, then Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will not be able to get any law passed that Mitch McConnell and the other Republicans aren’t going to go along with,” Obama said.

That was one of the only mentions Obama made of the incoming president, who sparked controversy on social media in May after an interview with the Breakfast Club where he said: “If you have a problem figuring out if you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.”

Later that day, Biden apologized: “No one, no one, should have to vote for any party based on their race, their religion, their background.”"	left

i9zqkw	obama	Obama rips Trump administration for 'suppressing the vote' amid pandemic, urges early voting	"Former President Barack Obama slammed President Donald Trump on Friday, accusing his administration of undermining the U.S. Postal Service and attempting to suppress votes during the coronavirus pandemic.

""Everyone depends on the USPS. Seniors for their Social Security, veterans for their prescriptions, small businesses trying to keep their doors open,"" Obama said on Twitter in a series of posts.

""They can't be collateral damage for an administration more concerned with suppressing the vote than suppressing a virus.""

Trump's Democratic predecessor urged eligible voters in states with early voting options to ""do that now.""

""The more votes in early, the less likely you're going to see a last minute crunch, both at polling places and in states where mail-in ballots are permitted. Then tell everyone you know,"" Obama said.

Obama Tweet 1

Obama Tweet 2/3

The tweets marked the latest broadside against the Trump administration from Obama, who in the runup to the 2020 election has grown more open in his criticism of the White House.

During his eulogy late last month at the funeral of former Rep. John Lewis, Obama had called out the efforts by ""those in power"" who are ""doing their darnedest to discourage people from voting — by closing polling locations, and targeting minorities and students with restrictive ID laws, and attacking our voting rights with surgical precision, even undermining the Postal Service in the run-up to an election that is going to be dependent on mailed-in ballots so people don't get sick.""

The USPS has come under intense scrutiny in recent months. Lawmakers of both parties have voiced concerns about drastic operational changes made by new Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a major donor to Republicans and Trump-supporting committees, which have led to reports of widespread mail delays.

Democrats in particular fear that the changes could impact the 2020 presidential election between Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, where more voters than ever before are expected to cast their ballots by mail."	left

On Wednesday, former President Barack Obama revealed on Instagram that his wife of 28 years had surprised him with a ""drawing of the 12th hole at Augusta National"" by the ""terrific"" artist Valentino Dixon.

""It's an incredible piece, but the story behind it is even better,"" said President Obama, 59, going on to explain that the Buffalo, New York-based Black artist ""was wrongfully convicted for a crime he didn't commit and sentenced to a minimum of 38 ½ years in prison"" when he was 21 years old.

""For more than two decades behind bars, he maintained his innocence,"" he continued of Dixon. ""Eventually, he renewed his passion for art, thanks to the advice of his uncle, who told him, 'If you reclaim your talent, you can reclaim your life.' ""

""Despite never visiting a golf course, he went on to use photos from magazines to draw golf courses like the one in this photo,"" President Obama wrote.

Dixon's ""art and his story gained national attention in 2012 through his family's tireless advocacy and a couple of profiles in golf publications,"" the author of A Promised Land shared. ""Then, in 2018, three undergraduate students from Georgetown's Innocence Project uncovered evidence that proved the innocence Valentino had maintained all along. And after 27 years, he was free.""

""Today, Valentino travels extensively to share his story and promote the need for criminal justice reform. And thankfully, for me and for so many others, he continues to draw,"" President Obama added, concluding, ""I'm so proud to have one of his works to display.""

Dixon shared a video of the commissioned artwork to his Instagram feed, explaining that he originally created the hand-drawn piece with colored pencils while in prison but was ""always going back and touching it up ... because a piece of artwork is never complete.""

""Michelle Obama reaching out to buy a golf drawing for Barack Obama for Christmas was an honor and a privilege,"" he wrote in the caption. ""This drawing took more than 400 hours and I believe is the largest golf drawing in the world, measuring 60 [inches] x 90 [inches].""

""Perfect anology [sic] for the deterioration at the White House: 5 years ago the real Bruno Mars performed at the White House,"" one user wrote on Twitter while retweeting the video of Trump's celebration.

In the footage, the military personnel could be heard singing Mars and Mark Ronson's 2014 song ""Uptown Funk."" Many critics also pointed out the relatively empty seats at Trump's event, which was largely criticized for still taking place amid the coronavirus pandemic.

A user said, ""To make matters worse no group that ever made a hit record wants the trump campaign to use their song, so this is what they get. A service man singing Bruno Mars. @realDonaldTrump is so pathetic, you’re embarrassing yourself.""

The Trump administration held its annual Fourth of July celebration on Saturday, despite local officials' concerns about the spread of COVID-19.

At the celebration, dubbed “Salute to America,"" the president gave an inflammatory speech making a number of claims that did not reflect the reality of the dramatic surge in cases around the country. “We’ve made a lot of progress, our strategy is moving along well,” said the president, who did not wear a face mask. “It goes out in one area and rears back its ugly face in another area, but we’ve learned a lot. We’ve learned how to put out the flame.”

Despite Trump’s claims, a number of states — including Florida, California, Arizona and Texas — have become hotspots for new coronavirus cases. Saturday also marked the third consecutive day of the country reporting new daily cases of over 50,000, hitting a new 24-hour high of 57,497 on Saturday, according to MarketWatch.

He also claimed that testing has shown that 99 percent of coronavirus cases “are totally harmless” — although Johns Hopkins University has estimated the fatality rate in the United States is 4.6 percent, according to CNN.

Just last month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, expressed cautious optimism that one of the several ongoing COVID-19 vaccine trials will be a success and can be mass-produced for Americans to get next year.

Trump delivered a similarly divisive speech the night before in South Dakota at another Independence Day celebration in front of Mount Rushmore.

Meanwhile, Obama told Americans to “be safe and smart” during the Fourth of July weekend.

“This holiday weekend, let’s be safe and smart,” he wrote on Twitter Saturday. “It’s going to take all of us to beat this virus. So wear a mask. Wash your hands. And listen to the experts, not the folks trying to divide us. That's the only way we’ll do this—together.”"	left

A source tells PEOPLE the former First Family is partaking in a decades-long family tradition of celebrating Christmas in the place where the former president spent most of his boyhood.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

Hawaii, where Obama was born, has been a regular retreat for the family over the years. (On past trips they've enjoyed everything from the Honolulu Zoo to area animal parks to dips in the ocean and basketball games and plenty of shaved ice and rounds of golf.)

Former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama were photographed Tuesday on a kayaking trip in the Aloha state.

This year's break comes after a turbulent year for the country, as Mrs. Obama explained in an Instagram post this week.

""For me, the holidays have always been a chance to slow down and reflect. We’ve endured so much this past year, from the devastation of the pandemic to the ups and downs of a hard-won election,"" she wrote on Tuesday. ""But what has perhaps stayed with me most is the passionate message of justice and empathy that has defined the Black Lives Matter protests around the world.""

Mrs. Obama, 56, lauded Patrick Hutchinson, who was photographed this summer in London carrying an injured white man during a protest.

""The truth is the millions around the world who showed up with their homemade signs were marching with the same kind of compassion that Mr. Hutchinson shows here,"" the former first lady wrote on Instagram. ""They’re folks who face discrimination on a daily basis because of the color of their skin. And they’re just asking to be shown the same level of humanity that our consciences demand we show anyone else in need.""

""I hope more people can find it in their hearts to meet these cries for decency not with mistrust, but with love and a willingness to listen,"" Mrs. Obama continued. ""Because as the COVID-19 crisis has made clear, our fates are inextricably bound. If the least of us struggles, we all in some way feel that pain. And, unless we keep speaking out and marching for equality, none of us will ever truly be free.""

She ended with this:

""I pray that in 2021, more of us will reach out to understand the experiences of those who don’t look, or vote, or think like we do. I pray that we learn to pause when we're tempted to react in anger or suspicion. And I pray that we choose generosity and kindness over our worst impulses. That isn’t always easy. But it’s a place to start. And we have so many terrific examples in all of the folks who marched for what’s right this year.

""Thanks to you all. I’m so proud of you.""

The year — of widespread social changes and upheaval and a historic presidential election and a deadly pandemic — brought new changes to the former first family as well: President Obama released the first of his two-volume White House memoir, A Promised Land; meanwhile daughters Malia, 22, and 19-year-old Sasha returned home like so many other college students in the spring to continue their college classes virtually.

Last week, 59-year-old Obama gave his social media followers the chance to ask him questions about his Renegades: Born In The USA podcast with Bruce Springsteen. On Friday, Complex posted a video of him answering their specific question, which was an inquiry about whether he has one rap verse he can recite by heart. Obama is a well-known rap fan, citing his love for artists like Kendrick Lamar and JAY-Z.

""First of all, Complex, you do not want to hear me rap,"" he joked. ""When I have tried to rap, my daughters have rolled their eyes, covered their ears. They think it's painful. They even think my dancing is better than my rapping.""

That being said, Obama did mention a specific song that he loves, one that was played frequently on his iPod while he was running for president: ""My 1st Song,"" by JAY-Z.

""It talks about the struggle of just trying to make it,"" he explained. ""And sometimes you have to resort to false bravado, and hustle, and tamping down your insecurities. And when I was running for president obviously, you know at that point, I didn't know whether I was gonna make it. So somehow that inspired me.""

He went on to recite a line from the song that still inspires him today.

""There was a line in there, 'Treat my first is my last and my last as my first, and my thirst is the same as when I came,'"" he shared. ""And, I actually kept on listening to that song during the presidency because it was a reminder that even when you do make it, you know, having a little bit of that sense of still being hungry, still having to work hard, still having to prove something, that that's what keeps propelling you forward. But, I'm still not gonna rap it.""

ET recently spoke to Obama's wife, beloved former first lady Michelle Obama, where she talked about life at home with her husband and their two kids amid the coronavirus pandemic.

""We have our health and we are together as a family,"" she said. ""And we're not getting on each other's nerves, so we count our blessings. We try to eat dinner together as a family every night. That's a pretty important ritual, so we usually have dinner at about 6:30, that's pretty regularly, and we have different kinds of foods.""

lgal5j	obama	President Obama’s Custom-Made Nike Hyperdunks Are Going Up for Auction	"Sneakerheads are always on the lookout for a pair of rare kicks. And they don’t come much more exclusive than a pair made for former President Barack Obama.

On Friday, a pair of Nike Hyperdunk basketball shoes custom made for No. 44 in 2009 are going up for sale on Sotheby’s Buy Now platform, just in time for President’s Day. But you don’t need to read the documentation to know that were meant for the erstwhile Commander-in-Chief, as they feature a number of design flourishes that make it abundantly clear who they belonged to.

If you’ve ever wondered what kind of basketball sneaker Obama favors, the answer is a classic high-top with plenty of ankle support. This specific pair, size 12.5, is based on the “United We Rise” Hyperdunks that the Team USA wore at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. They feature a white leather upper, visible Flywire technology and dark blue accents, including Nike’s iconic swoosh. The shoes also feature a number of Presidential details, including a red and blue “44” embroidered on the medial side of both toes, an insole with patriotic imagery and the date “1776.” On both tongues, you’ll find the official Seal of the President of the United States.

While being president comes with all manner of perks, it should come as no surprise that Nike made a pair of basketball sneakers specifically for Obama. The former president, who helped lead his high school to the Hawaii state championship in 1979 when he was a senior, has never hidden his passion for the game. In fact, during his time in office, he had the White House’s tennis court converted into a full-sized basketball court. And on his 49th birthday, greats of the game both past and present, like Magic Johnson, LeBron James and Chris Paul, were invited to play in what might be history’s most star-studded pickup game.

Obama’s custom-made Hyperdunks will drop at 4:44 pm EST on Friday, February 12 (the time honors his place as the 44th president). The pair is only one of two known to exist and thus carries an appropriately high $25,000 price tag to match."	left

""I want you to have hope. I want you to know you are not alone. I want you to know that Michelle and I will do anything you want me to do,"" Obama reportedly said during the 25-minute call.

The call shows how powerful Obama's role remains in American public life as a relatively young former president at 58-years-old.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Former President Barack Obama made a call to George Floyd's family that brought an emotional effect unparalleled by other leaders, according to Rev. Al Sharpton's telling in a New York Times feature.

""That was the first time, I think, that the Floyd family really experienced solace since he died,"" Sharpton said.

Former Vice President Joe Biden called the family and was well received, according to Floyd's brother, Philonese, while President Donald Trump ""didn't give me the opportunity to even speak.""

Yet Obama's call on June 4, according to Times reporters Elaina Plott and Glenn Thrush, had a real impact just about an hour before George's memorial service.

""I want you to have hope. I want you to know you are not alone. I want you to know that Michelle and I will do anything you want me to do,"" Obama said during the call, according to Sharpton and two others who were able to confirm the account.

The conversation was ""emotional,"" lasting 25 minutes in ""a reprise of the calls he made to grieving families over his eight years in office,"" according to the Times.

The call underscored the precarious and somewhat unprecedented role the 58-year-old former president is navigating out of office.

Obama is familiar with taking on the role of griever-in-chief.

Poignant moments remain from his presidency, such as his emotional speech after the Sandy Hook shooting and his rendition of ""Amazing Grace"" following a mass shooting at a historic Black church in Charleston, South Carolina."	left

In ""Kensington Palace: An Intimate Memoir from Queen Mary to Meghan Markle,"" a former palace employee said the Queen has even requested for Obama to return to the UK for another visit.

Barack and Michelle Obama visited the royal family three times between 2009 and 2016, however, they have not returned since leaving office.

Buckingham Palace declined to comment when contacted by Insider.

Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.

Queen Elizabeth has reportedly had a ""soft spot for Americans"" ever since meeting former President Barack Obama in 2009.

A former employee told royal author Tom Quinn that Her Majesty has even requested Obama to come back to the UK for a visit, even though he is no longer president.

""The Queen has a soft spot for Americans after meeting Barack Obama who she completely fell in love with – so much so that she has frequently asked her courtiers if they could arrange for him to come to Britain now he is no longer president,"" the former employee said in the new book, ""Kensington Palace: An Intimate Memoir from Queen Mary to Meghan Markle.""

The Queen usually hosts world leaders and presidents for official state visits to the UK, however, it would be unusual for Her Majesty to host a former president no longer in office.

The monarch first met Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama during the couple's visit to Buckingham Palace in 2009. The couple returned in 2011, and were also introduced to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, before returning for a final time in 2016.

The Queen also appeared to have established a close relationship with Michelle Obama through the years.

The women were photographed with their arms around one another during a visit in 2009 — a move which caused major backlash among the press, who claimed that the First Lady had broken protocol.

However, years later, the Queen's dressmaker Angela Kelly said this wasn't the case at all.

""Much has been made about the meeting between Michelle and Her Majesty, when an instant and mutual warmth was shared between these two remarkable women, and protocol was seemingly 'abandoned' as they stood closely with their arms around each other's backs,"" Kelly wrote in the 2009 book, ""The Other Side of the Coin: The Queen, The Dresser, and The Wardrobe.""

""In reality, it was a natural instinct for the Queen to show affection and respect for another great woman, and really there is no protocol that must be adhered to.

""When fondness is felt or the host of a state visit goes to guide Her Majesty up some steps, it truly is about human kindness, and this is something the Queen will always welcome warmly,"" she added.

Buckingham Palace declined to comment when contacted by Insider.

l5k6ww	obama	For Black pioneers Harris and Obama, different times mean different approaches on race	"Barack Obama campaigned for president in 2008 with explicit advice from his inner circle to downplay “any topic that might be labeled racial grievance” or to “do anything that would box me in as ‘the Black candidate,’” he wrote in his recent memoir.

Just over a dozen years later, Vice President Kamala Harris was ushered into the White House by the drumline of historically Black Howard University, her alma mater, to be the second in command of an administration that has made closing the racial wealth gap one of four policy “pillars.”

Distinctions in tone, emphasis and perception between the nation’s first Black president and its first Black vice president are not easy to draw. Obama spoke personally and poignantly about the nation’s troubled racial history — including in a 2008 Philadelphia speech sparked by controversy over his pastor — and Harris similarly has been able to interpret her personal encounters with the country’s racial divide for non-Black audiences.

Yet many see Harris as willing to lean harder into her public identity as a Black woman and to place societal racial gaps higher on her agenda. That is widely interpreted as an important marker in the country’s movement, spurred by a Trump presidency that placed white racial grievance at its center, by a summer of nationwide protests over the abuse of Black people in the criminal justice system and by a Capitol siege this month in which Trump supporters waving Confederate flags sought to overturn Joe Biden’s election.

“Both of them are candidates that act as translators on race,” said Arisha Hatch, vice president and chief of campaigns at Color of Change, a progressive political group that focuses on civil rights. “We’re just in a different place as a country.”

In the wake of police shootings of Black people caught on video, Americans of all races increasingly cite racial equity as a top issue in opinion polls. The Democratic Party has recognized that it would not have won the presidency, or the pair of crucial Senate run-offs in Georgia this month that gave it control of Congress, were it not for high turnout among Black voters, Black women in particular.

“Politicians, or leaders, tend to follow the voters,” said Cornell Belcher, a pollster for Obama and author of “A Black Man in the White House: Barack Obama and the Triggering of America’s Racial-Aversion Crisis.”

“In 2008, we didn’t have hundreds of thousands of our young people on the street protesting racism and the sort of systemic racial issues that you see with the criminal justice system,” he said. Those issues were propelled to the “front and center,” polls showed, among voters who chose Biden and Harris.

The two Democrats have a friendship that began when Harris was district attorney of San Francisco and a prominent Obama supporter early on, when his presidential bid was seen as unlikely. She traveled to Springfield, Ill., in February 2007 for his campaign launch. Obama drew criticism in 2013 for joking at an event that Harris “happens to be, by far, the best-looking attorney general in the country.” The controversy, though mild, pointed to the different set of challenges Harris faces as a woman in politics.

They spoke several times during the 2020 Democratic primary and general election campaigns, according to advisors, including when Harris was still a presidential candidate, and Obama, while neutral, was widely believed to favor Biden. An Obama aide said the former president has never explicitly advised Harris on how to address race on the political stage.

Obama did not shy from addressing the country’s history of racism. But he presented himself as a bridge-builder and emphasized that he was raised by white grandparents in an America that had begun the process of overcoming its fraught history on race. He persuaded doubters during the 2008 Democratic nomination contest, including Black voters, that he could win a general election. He coolly dismissed overtly racist lies promoted by Trump that he was not American and stereotypical slurs from others that his wife Michelle was an “angry” Black woman.

“The feeling that we had then was that the historical nature of his candidacy was obvious, that we did not want [him] to get pigeonholed as a candidate who was running to be the first Black president,” said David Axelrod, his chief political advisor. “We wanted him to be a candidate who was running for president who was Black, which was different.”

While recognizing the importance of Rep. Shirley Chisholm’s 1972 campaign as the first Black and woman seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, and of civil-rights leader Jesse Jackson’s runs in 1984 and 1988, the members of the Obama team did not want their candidate to be viewed as “making a statement” in a way that lowered expectations that he could win, Axelrod said.

Valerie Jarrett, a close advisor and friend throughout Obama’s political career, said, “We never used the words ‘racial grievance.’” She went on, “I would describe it as sensitivity that, in order to get elected ... to govern effectively, the country needs to see that you will govern for the entire country.”

Obama spoke out about racism on many occasions during his presidency, though mainly when events all but demanded that the first Black president do so. He invoked his young self and his young daughters when an unarmed teenager, Trayvon Martin, was shot dead in 2012 in Florida by a self-styled neighborhood watchman and delivered a stirring eulogy in 2015 for the nine people killed in a Black church in Charleston, S.C., by a white supremacist. His Justice Department made efforts to change policing practices, including establishing a task force that wrote a guidebook for police departments — initiatives that were abandoned by the Trump administration.

Advisors were cautious about drawing Obama into too many such discussions. They expressed frustration in 2009 when his remarks promoting his signature healthcare plan, the Affordable Care Act, were ignored in the controversy over his comment that police acted “stupidly” in arresting a Black Harvard professor, Henry Louis Gates Jr., as he tried to enter his home.

Jarrett said she not only worried that Obama would lose momentum for the bill but was annoyed that a single sentence at the end of a news conference appeared to hurt his standing among white voters in polls.

“I assure you, if Vice President Biden had said the same thing, the reaction would be very different,” she said.

But Jarrett said she also believes Obama’s tenure helped erode the double standard she saw and gave both Biden and Harris unprecedented opportunity to discuss race more frankly.

“In the current climate, people would not be surprised by either a President Biden or a Vice President Harris making a similar comment,” Jarrett said. “We are now talking about that in a way people were not a decade ago. ... In a sense, it’s progress.”

Donna Brazile — who was the first Black woman to lead a major party’s presidential campaign, when she managed former Vice President Al Gore’s bid in 2000 — said it’s too much to expect any politician to fix systemic problems that permeate the culture, the economy and the criminal justice system. Asking Black Americans to fix racism, she said, is like telling them to solve global warming, just because the floods hit the low-lying areas first.

“We have to dispense with the notion that Black people can uproot systemic racism in the United States of America,” she said. “We don’t have the power to do that. We don’t control the institutions. We’re not in charge.”

Harris, whose Black father emigrated from Jamaica, wrote in her memoir that her Indian-born mother, who had custody of Harris and her sister, Maya, when the parents separated, “understood very well that she was raising two black daughters.” She wanted to make sure “we would grow into confident, proud black women.”

Harris came of age at Howard University, the preeminent historically Black university, and cites her membership in Alpha Kappa Alpha, a Black sorority, as formative. Though she spent much of her adult life in San Francisco and entered politics there as the district attorney, she launched her presidential campaign in Oakland, with a jazz-funk band playing 1970s protest music, and based it in Baltimore, two cities known as Black cultural and political centers.

Harris had a mixed record on police reform during her years as a prosecutor and attorney general, and as a presidential candidate, she was forced on the defensive for her tough-on-crime stands. For example, she’d rejected demands for investigations into a pair of police shootings of Black men in 2014 and 2015.

She has since positioned herself as a leader in rooting out racial bias in policing and opposing cash-bail laws. She spoke out forcefully after the videotaped death of George Floyd during an arrest last May jump-started a summer of nationwide protests for racial justice.

She and Biden remain under pressure, however, to push harder on such issues — and certainly more forcefully than prior Democratic administrations, including Obama’s. Many young activists who have moved to the forefront of civil rights advocacy over the last decade, while frustrated that Obama did not make more strides, recognize that even many Black voters were reluctant to pressure him because of the obstacles he faced as the first Black president.

“It was actually harder as an accountability organization to demand things,” said Hatch, the activist at Color of Change. “The Biden-Harris administration doesn’t actually have that sort of veil of immunity from the Black community, and I think we expect to see promises fulfilled.”

Alicia Garza, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter who now leads the advocacy groups Black Futures Lab and Black to the Future Action Fund, said Harris uses the language of the movement to talk about racism as a structural problem. Obama and Biden, she said, were more likely to describe racial divisions as an issue of individuals failing to understand each other.

For example, Obama held a “beer summit” with Harvard’s Gates and the white police officer who mistakenly arrested him, attempting to bridge that gap in understanding. Biden, as a presidential candidate, told a story of his reconciliation as a young man with a Black antagonist nicknamed “Corn Pop.”

Harris, Garza said, understands racism as a problem that “permeates every aspect of our lives” and is not the result of a few white nationalists and “fanatics.” But she worries that the Biden administration may lose its resolve to tackle systemic racism as other crises take precedence.

“I think the question is not so much what her perspective on the question will be,” Garza said. It is, she went on, “What power does she have to address it?”"	left
kjkzga	obama	Michelle Obama buys Valentino Dixon's artwork as Christmas gift to Former President Obama	"BUFFALO, N.Y. (WKBW) — Valentino Dixon has drawn artwork for famous golfers, celebrities, and business tycoons.

But there might never be a commission request that tops the one this Buffalo-based artist received about three weeks ago, from former First Lady Michelle Obama.

""It doesn't get any better,"" said Dixon. “[Michelle Obama] saw my story on HBO and [her team] reached out to buy a golf drawing for Barack Obama for Christmas,” said Dixon.

Dixon was released from prison in September 2018 after serving 27 years for a 1991 murder he did not commit. A judge vacated Dixon's conviction after the then-prisoner received international attention for his lifelike drawings of golf courses.

Since his release, Dixon's life trajectory has been nothing short of remarkable. Notably, in spring 2019 Dixon was a guest at The Masters, where he met Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus. He has exhibited his work in art galleries in Buffalo and New York City, and more recently he launched his own YouTube series. His memoir is set to be released in March.

Now, Dixon can add drawing for the former President and First Lady to his resume. He calls this a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

""It’s not how you start, it’s how you finish. My story is one of faith and redemption,"" said Dixon, who hopes his story can serve as inspiration for people who are facing adversity.

Dixon tells 7 Eyewitness News that the piece of art Mrs. Obama commissioned is a 20"" x 30"" drawing of the 12th hole of Augusta National Golf Club. Coincidentally, Augusta is the very first golf course Dixon drew when he was in prison. The Attica superintendent asked him to draw a picture of the course, his favorite, as a favor. That drawing was the first of hundreds he would ultimately create inside his prison cell.

""We’re all going to be tested with something in this lifetime, and we don’t get to choose what test it’s going to be. We've just got to hang in there and stay strong. I’m an example to people that you can overcome everything.”

Along with the artwork, Dixon is also sending a short video to showcase his story and thank the Obamas for serving as an inspiration to him while he was incarcerated.

Mrs. Obama's team did not immediately respond to 7 Eyewitness News' request for comment.

Barack Obama Recites Eminem's 'Lose Yourself' as He Talks New Instagram Series About His Presidency

In an effort to reach younger audiences with his new book, President Barack Obama is bringing portions of it to Instagram with a new series.

Obama, 59, and the production company ATTN: announced Friday they are teaming up to launch a five-part video series that highlights some of the biggest themes from the 44th president’s new memoir, A Promised Land.

”In my new book, A Promised Land, I share the story of what inspired me to pursue public service and the ups and downs in my first few years of my presidency, but I wanted to share some of the most important moments with you,” Obama said in a Friday morning video launching the series.

“That's why I'm teaming up with ATTN: for a new series talking about some of the biggest moments that defined those years for me,” Obama said.

He will also be releasing Instagram Reels to pair with the series. In the first, posted Friday, Obama recites lyrics from Eminem’s 2002 hit “Lose Yourself” — which, Obama writes in his memoir, helped pump him up on the 2008 campaign trail.

“When I needed inspiration on the presidential campaign, I often turned to music,” Obama said, reading a passage from his book. ""It was that got my head in the right place."" Not just Eminem but JAY-Z's ""My 1st Song.""

The former president's Instagram series is intended for a new audience. ATTN: co-founder Matthew Segal said in a press release that “A Promised Land will undoubtedly be one of the biggest presidential books in history, and we want to make sure that the stories and themes make their way to younger audiences.”

“We hope that these new interviews and creative Reels that ATTN: has made will bring the policies and lessons of the Obama presidency to the next generation,” Segal said.

Obama released the first of a planned two-volume presidential memoir last month (and it was recently named one of PEOPLE’s top 10 books of 2020).

The first volume spans Obama’s initial years in the White House, opening up about key decisions he made while he was commander in chief and how the spotlight of the presidency strained his marriage to former First Lady Michelle Obama.

""I think we came out of it whole,"" President Obama recently told PEOPLE. ""There were great joys in the White House. There was never a time where we didn't recognize what an extraordinary privilege it was to be there. Most importantly, our children emerged intact and they are wonderful, kind, thoughtful, creative — and not entitled — young women. So that's a big sigh of relief.""

The former first lady, 56, similarly teamed up with ATTN: earlier this year to release her own IGTV series about the hurdles first-time college students face while living away from home for the first time.

ATTN: says their latest Obama series, with the former president, will total five episodes and will be released over the next two weeks. It's the company's fifth project with the Obamas, including three previous get-out-the-vote efforts in the 2020 general and 2018 midterm elections.

The company adds that President Obama will share additional ""insights and backstories"" from his two terms in office via Instagram Reels."	left

Former President Barack Obama spoke with the former NBA stars Shaquille O'Neal and Charles Barkley in a bid to address vaccine hesitancy among Black people.

They spoke on an NBC special released Sunday night, with Obama noting the demand for COVID-19 vaccines among the richest, most powerful people in the US. ""If the wealthy and powerful in our society are all lining up to get shots, that means everybody should know it's a good thing to get,"" he said.

Barkley, who is from Alabama, also said to ""forget what happened back in the day,"" a reference to the Tuskegee experiment in which scientists studied hundreds of Black men with syphilis from the 1930s into the 1970s without treating them.

U.S. District Judge John Robert Blakey did not agree and dismissed the lawsuit in the summer of 2019, declaring, “There should be no delay in construction.” In August, the 7th Circuit for the U.S. Court of Appeals effectively affirmed Blakey’s ruling.	left
kd2udh	obama	Barack Obama Tells Stephen Colbert The Satisfaction Of Being President	"More than four years since his time in the White House, former president Barack Obama says there are aspects of the job he misses.

Obama sat down for another set of interviews for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to promote his new memoir A Promised Land. The book, which has sold more than 1.5 million copies, takes readers on a deep dive into the president’s rise in politics and his eight years in office.

While 44 maximized his stay in the White House as commander-in-chief, he told Colbert about how he could’ve possibly extended tenure.

“I used to say if I can make an arrangement where I had a stand-in or front-man or front-woman and they had an earpiece in and I was just in my basement in my sweats looking through the stuff and I could sort of deliver the lines while someone was doing all the talking and ceremony, I’d be fine with that because I found the work fascinating,” Obama quipped.

While the hypothetical plan wouldn’t be the most constitutional or legal way to stay in office, Obama explained that it would be one way to achieve the level of satisfaction and excitement he experienced while in charge.

“Even on my worst days, I found puzzling out these big complicated, difficult issues, especially if you were working with some great people, to be especially professionally, really satisfying,” he said.

During the interview, Colbert and Obama discussed the transition of power and the current administration, with both subject and interviewer keeping Donald Trump’s name out of the conversation. The two joked that Obama had learned there was so much he could have not done while in office after witnessing the current president’s work style.

“I think there’s a lot, follow the Constitution,” Obama laughed.

While he expressed some discontent with the current White House administration, Obama shared admiration and excitement for the new generations of change-makers, saying that GenX-ers should “get out of the way.”

“They’re smarter than we were, they’re more sophisticated, they’re kinder, they’re environmentally more conscious,” he said. “They believe in stuff that maybe we gave lip service to but didn’t always want to live out because it required some sacrifice. You see them living out their commitments in really powerful ways.”

The claim: Former President Barack Obama arrested

In the tumultuous time following the U.S. presidential election, misinformation and conspiracy theories thrived on social media, entangling prominent politicians in outlandish claims.

In a Jan. 17 video posted to Facebook, the host of the conservative ""America Divided Podcast"" shared a video of former President Barack Obama in a jail cell, saying he was ""getting to know the place.""

Noting that thousands of National Guard troops had been deployed to D.C. following the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, host Gage Nelson said, ""The rumor on the street is that, on Jan. 20, many people are going to jail ... and well, now there's video of Barack Obama in a jail cell, which kind of blows my mind.""

While Nelson acknowledges in the video that Obama hasn't actually been arrested, the title and caption of the post fail to clearly do so.

""BARACK OBAMA ARRESTED... 75 days after election day in America and, a NEW video surfaced of former President Barack Obama in a JAIL CELL leaving many to question... Was OBAMA ARRESTED?...,"" the caption reads.

The ""America Divided Podcast"" page responded to a request for comment with a statement from Nelson, mentioning that the page had received backlash for click-baiting viewers.

""The point of that video was to dispute the claims that Obama had been detained,"" the statement reads. ""Our goal was only to reach as many people as possible so that they didn't fall for the FAKE rumors. America Divided isn't monetized in any way meaning we didn't earn a dime from that video.""

Obama visited prison on Robben Island

The video of Obama in the jail cell is from 2013, when the Obamas took a trip to Robben Island, in South Africa, which is known for holding future South African President Nelson Mandela prisoner for 18 years.

The Guardian posted the clip of Obama in Mandela's cell to its YouTube channel in 2013.

Nelson acknowledges this in the ""America Divided"" video, saying, ""However, unfortunately, as much as I would love to say this video is 100% real ... Barack Obama has not been arrested, however, he very well could be.""

Our rating: False

The claim in the post is FALSE. While Nelson acknowledges that his primary claim of Obama being arrested isn't actually true a few minutes into the video, the caption and title of the post remain inaccurate and misleading. The clip of Obama in a jail cell is from a 2013 trip to Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela was a prisoner for 18 years.

hwq2ya	obama	Joe Biden And Barack Obama Debut New Video Where They Chide Donald Trump For Taking “No Responsibility”	"UPDATED, with comment from Trump campaign: Joe Biden’s campaign debuted a new video with Barack Obama, meant as a teaser of a longer conversation between the two on Thursday, as well as to show a contrast with Donald Trump’s presidency.

The full conversation will be shown on their social media platforms. The Biden campaign also announced another fundraiser with Obama for next week.

“Can you imagine when you are president, standing up and saying, ‘It’s not my responsibility, I take no responsibility?'” Biden says in the video.

“Those words didn’t come out of our mouths while we were in office,” Obama responds.

“I don’t understand his inability to get a sense of what people are going through,” Biden says. “He just can’t relate in any way.”

Obama says, “It all starts with being able to relate…If you can sit down with a family and see your own family in them, and the struggles that you have gone through or your parents went through or your kids are going through, if you can connect those struggles to somebody else’s struggle, then you are going to work hard for them. And that’s always what has motivated you to get into public service.”

Biden and Obama will appear together again on Tuesday at a virtual fundraiser for the Biden Victory Fund, a joint committee of the Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee, according to an invite obtained by Recode. A Biden-Obama event in June brought in $11 million to the campaign.

The Biden campaign released additional footage later on Wednesday.

Barack Obama is ""unembarrassed"" about singing — and the former president proves it on the latest episode of his podcast with Bruce Springsteen.



Obama, 59, and Springsteen, 71, have an hour-long discussion about the power of music on the third episode of Renegades, including how it influenced the former's two terms in the White House.



But before talking, the duo — who first bonded during Obama's campaign — get down to singing.



Springsteen fiddles through a version of the Bobby ""Blue"" Bland classic ""Further On Up the Road,"" while Obama sings along — even giving the 20-time Grammy winner some pointers.



""Wait, we gotta get in the right key,"" he tells Springsteen, who laughs and immediately switches the key to match Obama's voice.



""Further on up the road, you've been laughing, pretty baby, someday you're gonna be crying,"" Obama hums along, laughing when he quickly starts to forget the words.

""Further on up the road, you— I forget that last line,"" he jokes, giving a few ""uhs"" here and there, getting into Springsteen's playing. ""Sounds alright, though!""

The duo debuted their eight-part Renegades series last week, in which the former president and famed rocker share ""in deep and revealing conversation with each other, exploring a wide array of topics including race, fatherhood, marriage, and the state of America,"" according to Spotify.



In their third episode, focused on music's effect on their lives and careers, Obama tells Springsteen about the artists he listened to in his early teens.



""The first album I bought with my own money was Talking Book by Stevie Wonder,"" Obama tells Springsteen.



""I would sit with a banged up, little old turntable,"" he recalls, adding, ""I would sing along to every Stevie Wonder song for hours.""

""I sing in the shower, I sing outside of the shower. I am unembarrassed about singing,"" Obama says, laughing. ""My daughters and my wife sometimes roll their eyes. I have been known to have been scolded by my staff for doing some air guitar stuff on Air Force One.""

Springsteen tells Obama about how he was also ""a creature of Top 40"" as a child, sharing how he learned the blues from his mother having the radio on in the mornings.



Later, he got into more ""fatalistic"" folk-country artists like Woody Guthrie in his late 20s and early 30s and that helped rejuvenate his career, he says.

As for Obama, the former president gives his podcasting partner a few examples of how music played a vital role during his eight years in the White House.



He says he and First Lady Michelle Obama made an effort to have music nights at the White House, from motown to country.

The live music series at the White House featured musicians playing from different genres, such as a country singer playing an R&B song, President Obama says, in order ""to emphasize and underscore how all these traditions in fact do blend together.""



Obama also shares an archived clip of himself singing Al Green's ""I'm Still In Love With You"" during a speech at Harlem's Apollo Theater in New York City, while sharing a deeply emotional tale about how he came to the decision to famously sing ""Amazing Grace"" during his eulogy after the 2015 Charleston, South Carolina, church massacre of black parishioners.



""It was a moment where you just say, 'Will words be enough?' "" Obama remembers, noting how ""it seemed like every three months"" there was another mass shooting during his presidency.



Thinking back to that poignant moment during his second term, Obama says he relied on music because it has an ability to capture a ""unifying element in America."""	left
kqf1qe	obama	Georgians blitzed by runoff-election ads, as Democrats deploy Barack Obama and Republicans counter with Herschel Walker	"Georgians are being inundated with political advertising ahead of the state’s crucial U.S. Senate runoff elections on Tuesday, as estimates put total media spending at around $500 million so far.

Former President Barack Obama narrates the latest TV ad for Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff, who’s facing incumbent Republican Sen. David Perdue, who said Thursday he was entering quarantine after exposure to a person who tested positive for COVID-19.

“You can send Jon Ossoff to the Senate to beat this virus and rebuild our economy,” Obama says.

See: Pence to make eleventh-hour ‘faith community’ appeal on behalf of Georgia Republicans Loeffler and Perdue

Meanwhile, former football star Herschel Walker, who played at the University of Georgia before signing with the Donald Trump–owned New Jersey Generals of the USFL, appears in a spot for Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, whose Democratic challenger is Rev. Raphael Warnock. The three pass a football around while explaining the election’s importance to viewers.

“Too much is at stake. Vote Kelly and David. Help Georgia win this for America,” says Walker.

Mailers, digital ads, radio ads and ever-present TV commercials look set to keep coming through Tuesday.

Is it all worth it? “The simplest answer is that, no, at this point the ads, etc., are not motivating voters in one direction or another,” said Robert M. Howard, a professor of political science at Georgia State University. “There is a significant diminishing return to the money spent in this particular cycle.”

But Howard added: “Do not get me wrong — money is important. You want to get your message out, and you do not want to be solely defined by your opponent.”

The two Georgia runoffs are crucial because Democratic victories in both races would give that party control of the chamber. There would be a 50-50 split, but a Democratic vice president, Kamala Harris, would cast tie-breaking votes. Republicans can remain the majority party by winning just one of the two Georgia races, and they then would provide a check on policies backed by President-elect Joe Biden and the Democratic-run House of Representatives.

Recordings from Trump in support of Loeffler and Perdue and by Biden — the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry the state in decades — for Ossoff and Warnock have also buffeted voter ears. Thousands of pounds of paper campaign flyers, too, have found their way into Georgia’s mailboxes in the two months since the Nov. 3 election.

The spending on advertising says a lot about the impact of the results from this election and the popularity of the candidates involved, according to John Link, vice president of sales at AdImpact, an ad-tracking company that previously was known as Advertising Analytics.

“Spend levels are clearly attributable to the successes of fundraising efforts,” Link said. “As long as donors remain as active as we have seen recently, you should expect spending levels to remain historically high.”

The principal campaign committee for Ossoff, a documentary filmmaker, has disclosed raising $107 million from Oct. 15 through Dec. 16, above the $68 million figure for Perdue, the former CEO of Dollar General DG, -1.65% . Warnock, pastor at Atlanta’s storied Ebenezer Baptist Church, brought in $103 million during the same period vs. $64 million for Loeffler, a former financial-services executive whose husband heads the New York Stock Exchange’s parent company ICE, -0.95% .

Alongside the candidates’ campaigns, political action committees and super PACs have been busy attempting to reach voters with ads. Republican PACs like American Crossroads, Senate Leadership Fund and Peachtree PAC have been major players, along with Democratic PACs such as the Georgia Way, New South Super PAC, Priorities USA and the New Power PAC. Some analysts have predicted that the overall cash outlay by campaign committees and other groups could reach $1 billion.

“Both sides have so much money and so much media attention, that both sides — Republican incumbents and the Democratic opponents — have had no trouble getting their message out,” said Howard, the Georgia State professor.

More than 3 million Georgians, or 39% of the state’s registered voters, had cast ballots early in the Senate runoffs as of Monday, according to U.S. Elections Project data. Georgia law required the runoffs when no candidate received more than 50% of the vote in either Senate race in November.

About 118,000 runoff early voters had not voted in November, according to figures compiled by Georgia Votes. The advertisements dominating TV in Georgia could have had something to do with engaging these voters, even if the overall effect is unclear.

“At some point, voters just tune out all the ads and commercials, and mailed flyers and emails,” Howard said. “Probably the best use of money now is for it to be used on get-out-the-vote efforts, and that seems to be happening for both sides.”

Barack Obama Remembers Thinking ‘You Can Do Anything’ During His First Trip to U.S. Mainland as a Child

Barack Obama remembers thinking ""you can do anything and be anybody"" you want during his first trip to the mainland U.S. as a child.

The former president was raised in Hawaii for most of his childhood before moving to Los Angeles after high school, later finishing his studies at Columbia University in New York City and then Harvard University in Boston.

But when he was about 11 years old, Obama flew to the U.S. with his mother, grandmother and 2-year-old sister, Maya, for a road trip across the country.

Obama, now 59, recalls the trip on the latest episode of his new Renegades podcast with friend Bruce Springsteen.

""I remember looking out a Greyhound buses and looking out of trains and looking out of car windows,"" Obama tells the 71-year-old Springsteen. ""Just miles of corn or miles of desert, or miles of forest, or miles of mountains.""



Staring out of the bus window, Obama says, he was ""just thinking, 'Man, imagine where you can go. You can go anywhere, and by implication, you can do anything and be anybody.' ""

Obama says the family first flew to Seattle where his mother, Ann Dunham, had attended college for a year shortly after he was born.

From Seattle, they took a Greyhound bus to San Francisco and then to L.A., before taking a train to Arizona. After working their way down the West Coast, the future president and his family went to Kansas City then up to Chicago before renting a car and driving to Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming.

""My mother didn't drive,"" Obama tells Springsteen, because she didn't have a license. So that meant a pre-teen Obama was tasked with riding shotgun and directing his grandma, Madelyn Dunham.

""My grandmother drove but she's starting to go a little blind,"" Obama says on the podcast with a laugh. ""I remember being put in the front seat at around twilight so that I can direct my grandmother properly as we're hitting some of these turns in the road.""

That's when Obama says he first saw the expansive landscapes of the continental U.S.

""For me, part of the essential aspect of being an American is getting out of where you are,"" he tells Springsteen in Monday's podcast episode, as they share stories with each other about traveling across the U.S. and how those trips inspired them throughout their lives.

""You and I could jump in [my] Corvette and go to Route 66,"" Springsteen jokes with Obama. ""Though, Michelle [Obama] and Patti [Springsteen] might kick our asses, right?""

""Yeah, I don't know how far we'd get,"" Obama responds.

He and Springsteen launched their Renegades podcast series on Spotify last month. The streaming service said they would share ""personal"" and ""revealing"" stories that reflected broader discussions about the country."	left
kkm83r	obama	Obamas Send Holiday Wishes of ‘Light, Love and Wonder’	"Both the former president and former first lady posted holiday wishes on social media

Barack and Michelle Obama went on Twitter on Christmas Eve to share their family's heartwarming holiday wishes.

In a tweet posted by Mrs. Obama, the former first lady shared a photo of the family dogs — Bo and Sunny, both wearing Santa hats — along with a message of good tidings.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

""Wishing you light, love, and wonder during this holiday season,"" Mrs. Obama, 56, wrote. ""May the coming year bring us all joy and peace.""

In his own Christmas message, the 44th president alluded to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, noting that this holiday is altogether different than those of years' past. Still, he encouraged everyone to celebrate the season of giving.

""This Christmas looks different for all of us. As we spend time with those we love—in person or virtually—let us celebrate the blessings we cherish, embrace the spirit of giving, and look out for one another,"" Mr. Obama, 59, wrote. ""From my family to yours, Merry Christmas!""

Along with his message, Mr. Obama shared a photo of a holiday card that read: ""Wishing you and yours a joyous and peaceful holiday season."" The card is signed by all members of the Obama family, including both family dogs.

The couple is spending the holiday in Hawaii, and was photographed earlier this week kayaking in the ocean.

Like many Americans, the past year has been a time of personal growth for the Obamas, who have been spending increased time at home with their daughters, 22-year-old Malia and 19-year-old Sasha, due to the coronavirus pandemic.

According to Mr. Obama, the quality time has led to a deepened relationship between his daughters.

""Like a lot of families who are lucky enough not to have to worry about losing a job, or a family member getting sick, there are times where it's felt claustrophobic, I'm sure, for them,"" he said of his girls in a November interview for a PEOPLE cover story.

""I think part of what's been also wonderful is seeing Malia and Sasha become such great friends,"" he continued, adding that they've matured as they've gotten older. ""Now they're both old enough, where they just enjoy each other's company and to be together as a family and see how they've become these marvelous young women — there's been no greater joy than that.""

Of course, it hasn't always been smooth sailing, with Mrs. Obama joking to Conan O'Brien in September that the family had started to get on each other's nerves during the pandemic.

""I think first our kids got a little sick of us ... which was fine, 'cause we were pretty much sick of them,"" she said. ""And so the summer started happening, and then we could be outside a little bit more ... And now the kids are back in Zoom land with classes. They're doing it remotely. And they're no longer thrilled about being with us.""

Still, the couple has found time to carve out for themselves, with Mrs. Obama telling talk show host Rachael Ray that she had taken up a new hobby while in quarantine: knitting.

″Over the course of this quarantine, I have knitted a blanket, like five scarves, three halter tops, a couple of hats for Barack, and I just finished my first pair of mittens for Malia,"" she said. ""One is twice as big as the other. I’m still working on my stitching gauge.″

Mr. and Mrs. Obama also found the time and space for a proper date — even in their quarantine bubble — with the former first lady telling Ray that her husband had surprised her with a beach picnic during the pandemic.

""So he had a lunch pack. He didn’t do it, but he had it packed,"" she said, ""and we had wine and a little jazz and we had our two little beach chairs and an umbrella and we were just hanging out on the beach alone.""

It's also been a year of successes for the family, with the former president releasing his record-breaking memoir, A Promised Land, in November.

The book sold some 1.7 million copies in its first week, putting it on track to become the best-selling presidential memoir of all time.

As has become an annual tradition, the former president recently released his year-end playlists of his favorite songs, books, television shows and films of 2020.

Earlier this month, Mr. Obama confessed that his daughters are involved in the curation of his annual lists."	left
gvi8jz	obama	Biden, Obama take steps to fill glaring leadership vacuum	"Former President Barack Obama published a piece to Medium yesterday, sketching out ""some thoughts on how to make this moment a real turning point to bring about real change."" The missive, which was only about 1,000 words, was clearly intended by its author to be constructive and help lay the groundwork for sustained and meaningful change.

But in the process, Obama also helped create a striking contrast between his message to the public and his successor's.

The former president began by acknowledging the legitimacy of the protests, emphasizing the fact that the vast majority of protestors have been peaceful, and condemning those who've turned to violence. Obama went on to explain the importance not only of voting, but of the relevance of voting in state and local elections, where police reforms can have the greatest impact.

He added, as part of an effort to move the process forward, ""[A]s a starting point, here's a report and toolkit developed by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and based on the work of the Task Force on 21st Century Policing that I formed when I was in the White House. And if you're interested in taking concrete action, we've also created a dedicated site at the Obama Foundation to aggregate and direct you to useful resources and organizations who've been fighting the good fight at the local and national levels for years.""

This wasn't the point of Obama's piece, but it stood as a reminder of what a president sounds like -- and how leaders should try to use their platforms.

But the former president isn't alone in trying to fill the nation's leadership vacuum; his former vice president is trying to step up, too.

Joe Biden on Tuesday praised the nationwide peaceful protests to the death of George Floyd, calling his killing in police custody a ""wake-up call for our nation"" and drawing a stark contrast between President Donald Trump's tactics and how he would respond.

Biden delivered the remarks in Philadelphia -- the same city Obama delivered his famous ""A More Perfect Union"" speech in March 2016. (It also comes a day after Biden met with community leaders at Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Delaware.)

""Look, the presidency is a big job,"" the Democratic candidate said this morning. ""Nobody will get everything right. And I won't either. But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate. I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country -- not use them for political gain.""

Biden's remarks included a policy component, including endorsing police-reform measures, most notably a proposed national ban on chokeholds. He added that he would launch a police-oversight commission within 100 days of his inauguration. Just as importantly, Biden emphasized that issues such as health care and pay equity are pieces of the same larger puzzle.

But as the former vice president was poised to speak this morning, the man he hopes to replace was on Twitter, thanking himself for cities with diminished unrest last night, and touting the importance of ""domination"" over certain Americans. It came the day after an offensive against peaceful protestors cleared a path so Trump could briefly pose in front of a church for no reason.

It was as if each of the relevant players were collectively trying to create the clearest possible contrast."	left

jxt1z0	obama	Barack Obama's new memoir sells nearly 890,000 copies in 24 hours (sorry, Michelle)	"Barack Obama’s “A Promised Land” sold nearly 890,000 copies in the U.S. and Canada in its first 24 hours, putting it on track to be the bestselling presidential memoir in modern history.

The first-day sales, a record for Penguin Random House, includes preorders, e-books and audio.

“We are thrilled with the first-day sales,” said David Drake, publisher of the Penguin Random House imprint Crown. “They reflect the widespread excitement that readers have for President Obama’s highly anticipated and extraordinarily written book.”

The only book by a former White House resident to come close to the early pace of “A Promised Land” is the memoir by Obama’s wife, Michelle Obama, whose “Becoming” sold 725,000 copies in North America its first day and has topped 10 million worldwide since its release in 2018. “Becoming” is still so in demand that Crown, which publishes both Obamas and reportedly paid around $60 million for their books, has yet to release a paperback.

As of midday Wednesday, “A Promised Land” was No. 1 on Amazon and Barnes & Noble’s website. James Daunt, chief executive of Barnes & Noble, said that the superstore chain easily sold more than 50,000 copies its first day and hoped to reach half a million within 10 days.

“So far it has been neck-and-neck with Michelle Obama’s book,” he said.

By comparison, Bill Clinton’s “My Life” sold about 400,000 copies in North America its first day and George W. Bush’s “Decision Points” around 220,000, with total sales for each memoir currently between 3.5 and 4 million copies.

The fastest-selling book in memory remains J.K. Rowling’s seventh and final Harry Potter installment, “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” which came out in 2007 and sold more than 8 million copies within 24 hours.

Obama’s 768-page memoir, which came out Tuesday and has a list price of $45, had unusually risky timing for a book of such importance to the author, to readers and to the publishing industry. It came out just two weeks after election day and could have been overshadowed had the race still been in doubt, or perhaps unwanted by distressed Obama fans if President Trump had defeated Democratic nominee Joe Biden.

But Biden won, and his victory likely renews interest in an era when he was Obama’s trusted and popular vice president.

Obama himself acknowledges that he didn’t intend for the book, the first of two planned volumes, to arrive so close to a presidential election or to take nearly four years after he left the White House — months longer than it took for “My Life” and two years longer than it took for “Decision Points” to hit the shelves.

In the introduction to “A Promised Land,” dated August 2020, Obama writes that “the book kept growing in length and scope” as he found he needed more words than expected to capture a given moment — a bind many authors well understand.

He was also working under conditions he “didn’t fully anticipate,” including the COVID-19 pandemic, the Black Lives Matters protests and, “most troubling of all,” how the country’s “democracy seems to be teetering on the brink of crisis.”

Because of the pandemic, Obama will not go on the all-star arena tour Michelle Obama had for “Becoming.” But he benefits from the attention of any memoir by a former president and by his rare stature among politicians of writing his own books and of attracting as much or more attention for how he tells a story than for the story itself.

Obama has already written two acclaimed, million-selling works, “Dreams from My Father” and “The Audacity of Hope,” which came out in 2006. His new book covers some of the same time period as his previous ones, while continuing his story through the first years of his presidency and the 2011 killing of Osama bin Laden by Navy SEALS.

Kris Kleindienst, co-owner of Left Bank Books in St. Louis, anticipates selling about 1,000 copies by the end of the year, a number which makes “a HUGE difference” for annual revenues, she wrote in an email. Sarah McNally, owner of McNally Jackson Books in Manhattan, said she sold around 600 copies in the first 24 hours, a pace exceeded only by the final Harry Potter book.

“It’s not hard to be a bright spot this year, a year when we would have gone out of business without federal aid,” McNally said. “But Obama does feel like a savior, as do our customers for buying this from us.”"	left

k8lt27	obama	President Obama Admits He Was Briefed on UFO Sightings	"Ever since the alleged UFO crash in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947, people have been obsessed with a conspiracy theory that the United States government has been hiding evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial life. And a metric ton of pop culture, from Close Encounters of the Third Kind to The X-Files, has been based around said conspiracies.

(The segment starts around the 9:26 mark.)

Of course, few people in government would have access to such information were it true. Presumably however, one of those people would be the President of the United States. Which is why Stephen Colbert asked our 44th president Barack Obama if he ever bothered to ask during a recent interview (via Boing Boing). While occupying the Oval Office, did Obama actually dig into all this? It turns out, he sure did.

Barack Obama is a known sci-fi/fantasy nerd, who grew up loving Spider-Man comics and Conan the Barbarian. So of course, it only makes sense that once he became President, he’d look into what our government’s knowledge of UFO’s actually is. “I certainly asked about it,” Obama says. Colbert presses for more of a definitive answer, at which point 44 says, “I can’t tell you that.” As the talk show host surmises, if there was no truth to any of this stuff, one would simply say, “there’s nothing to it?” Right?

CBS

The world today is currently awash with ridiculous conspiracy theories on every subject. Belief in some of these is actually eroding our collective intellect. Obama told Colbert “It used to be that UFOs and Roswell was the biggest conspiracy. And now that seems so tame, the idea that the government might have an alien spaceship.” Truthfully, an alien ship crashing and a cover-up to hide that information is still believable. Shapeshifting lizard people in elected office? Maybe not so much."	left

President Trump has refused to concede the election to Biden, despite Biden winning by a comfortable margin. His campaign has mounted several legal challenges in an attempt to delay or halt vote certification in several states.

Trump’s refusal has caused issues for Biden’s transition. The General Services Administration has yet to issue an ascertainment that Biden is president-elect, which has delayed access to millions in federal funding for the incoming administration. In addition, Biden is not receiving daily presidential intelligence briefings.

Democrats and health officials have grown furious at Trump for obstructing the White House, warning that this could endanger lives amid the coronavirus pandemic.

During his appearance on ""Kimmel,"" Obama said he wished the transition was going better, noting “we lose time during these crises.” He noted that former President George W. Bush ordered his team to work with Obama’s during the transition in 2008, which was happening in the middle of the financial crisis.

“Could not have been more gracious, could not have been more helpful,” Obama said. “And that actually helped us be able to get a head start on trying to stem what could have been a great depression instead of a great recession.”"	left
mnmh8p	obama	Exclusive: How Ted Kennedy and Nancy Pelosi pushed Barack Obama to go big on health care	"This story is adapted from “Madam Speaker: Nancy Pelosi and the Lessons of Power,” which will be published April 20 by Twelve Books. Author Susan Page, the Washington Bureau chief of USA TODAY, conducted 10 interviews with Pelosi for this biography and interviewed more than 150 other friends, family members, political allies and adversaries.

The morning after Republican Scott Brown unexpectedly won the 2010 special election election to fill Ted Kennedy's Senate seat in Massachusetts, President Obama called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a pivotal and private conversation that wasn’t disclosed.

“Madam Speaker: Nancy Pelosi and the Lessons of Power,” by Susan Page

At the time, some White House advisers were urging Obama to cut his losses on a comprehensive health care bill. Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel had made it clear from the start that he was skeptical about going big; now he raised his objections more loudly. Democrats had lost their filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, and it wasn’t clear what would or could happen next. Their plan for passing the legislation had just been blocked by the election of a 41st GOP senator.

The Backstory: Pelosi's No. 1 lesson on power: 'Nobody's going to give it to you. You've got to take it.'

That said, strategists on the Hill and the White House had devised a legislative escape hatch for just this situation, designed to be deployed if their Senate supermajority didn’t hold – either because of the election of a Republican or the defection of a Democrat. That was always a risk; some moderate Democratic senators had voted for the bill only reluctantly. That’s why Massachusetts senator Ted Kennedy and Nancy Pelosi had insisted at the start that the legislation include a provision that permitted budget reconciliation. At the time, Budget chairman Kent Conrad of North Dakota and Finance chairman Max Baucus of Montana had adamantly opposed including the procedure, arguing that it was provocative to Republicans and unnecessary.

In their phone call, Obama told me that he and Pelosi were in sync: Better to fight for a big bill than to scale back their goals. Despite its complications and limitations, the tool to do that would be reconciliation.

“My attitude is that, for us to take a quarter of a loaf or a half a loaf is missing an opportunity, that it would leave millions of people running short,” Obama said. “And I’ll be honest, it wasn’t even clear at that point that the Republicans would in fact take a smaller bill because they had been moving the goalposts consistently throughout this process. So it wasn’t as if there was a ready compromise to be had, anyway. So my strong belief, as I’ve told my staff, is we’re going to go forward with this if we have any opportunity left to do it.”

That would depend on Pelosi.

“The only way for us to do it was if the House was, at some point, going to hold its nose and pass the Senate version,” Obama said. That was legislation House leaders had been describing as unacceptable just a few days earlier. “I essentially said to Nancy, ‘Look, this is the debate that’s been had in the White House. My strong preference is that we go with a robust, full package, but the only package, at this point, we can get passed is the Senate bill. We could potentially bleep some provisions that you guys consider particularly obnoxious, [but] there’s only going to be so much we can do.

“ ‘And, Nancy, I can’t do this without you. If you are not willing to work with me to work your caucus, to get them to pass the Senate version, we don’t have a path.’”

BRACING FOR BATTLE: Inside Nancy Pelosi's war with Donald Trump

Pelosi first took the opportunity to vent about the folly of the other side of the Capitol. This may have had less to do with her admittedly dyspeptic views of the Senate than with the responsibility she felt to articulate the views of her caucus. Obama saw her complaints as tactical, not peevish.

“She wasn’t going to right off the bat come out and say, ‘Yeah, I guess we just have to pass the Senate bill,’ because this is an example of her savvy,” Obama told me. “After spending about half an hour describing how feckless and incompetent the Senate was, she then proceeded to say, ‘Well, of course we have no choice but to go ahead and get the whole thing done.’ Then it became a strategy and tactical conversation.”

Pelosi didn’t need Obama to explain reconciliation to her, of course. Two senior White House advisers told me it was Pelosi who first recognized and advocated using the parliamentary maneuver to the president, not the other way around. While the Senate bill would have to be the vehicle, under reconciliation she could negotiate some significant changes in it through a bill of amendments known in Hill-speak as a “sidecar.” She would have to brainstorm a creative way to reassure House Democrats that they could count on the Senate to deliver that.

A few days later, Obama and Pelosi would have another crucial conversation, this time in person and in front of others. The president convened a meeting in the Oval Office with Pelosi, Harry Reid, and top White House and congressional staffers. Emanuel began to make the case for a more limited bill. He thought the realistic option was to scale back – not to cover everyone, for instance, but just focus on children. Not to mandate the difficult steps necessary to ensure affordable coverage to everyone with preexisting conditions, health problems that made them unappealing to insurance companies.

Some of those in the room were dismayed that Obama allowed his chief of staff to continue lobbying against a comprehensive bill, something the boss presumably could have stopped in an instant, with a few words. The president may have settled on going big, but his willingness to let his top aide keep arguing for going small was interpreted by some, accurately or not, as signaling ambivalence in the White House.

In the meeting, it was Pelosi who pushed back hard, going further than previous accounts have reported. She was determined to cut off any exit ramp, to make it impossible for the White House to trim ambitions for the health care bill. Harry Reid, who often remained quiet during such confrontations, backed her up at this key moment.

The president had told her he couldn’t get the big bill through Congress without her. Now she told the White House that she wouldn’t work for anything except a big bill. A more modest Plan B? “I said, ‘We’re not going there,’ ” Pelosi told me. Regardless of the qualms of Emanuel, she gave the administration only two options: Go big or get nothing. It was an extraordinary demonstration of political hardball.

Her chief of staff, John Lawrence, who attended the meeting, described it this way. “I remember her turning to the president and saying, ‘I know that there are people who are telling you that we should go for just a very minor bill, and I’m just telling you, we’re not going to do that in the House of Representatives,’ ” Lawrence recalled. “ ‘We won’t accept that.’ And I remember the president looking at her and saying, ‘Okay.’ And I think that was sort of the key moment where the decision was made that we weren’t going to go for what I think Mrs. Pelosi called the ‘eensy-weensy’ approach. We were going for the big bill.”

There was no guarantee they would succeed, but the course was set.

Now Pelosi was responsible for achieving what many others saw as an impossible task. Senate Democrats no longer had the votes to end a filibuster and bring a new bill up for a vote. House Democrats had spent nearly a year painstakingly working out their plan, one she called “as near perfect as any bill could be.” In comparison, she told me, “The Senate bill was terrible.” Even so, House Democrats would have to be convinced to accept it with the promise of then being able to amend some of its provisions.

She simply dismissed the idea that they might fail.

In a conference call with the Democratic leadership and the chairs of key committees, Pelosi made their marching orders clear. She described Emanuel as an “incrementalist” and said they weren’t going to pursue an “eensy, weensy spider, teeny tiny” bill. Her message to nervous House Democrats was the same as it had been to reluctant White House officials: We’re doing this. She simply dismissed the idea that they might fail.

“We will go through the gate,” she told reporters the week after the Massachusetts election. “If the gate is closed, we will go over the fence. If the fence is too high, we will pole-vault in. If that doesn’t work, we will parachute in. But we are going to get health care reform passed for the American people for their own personal health and economic security, and for the important role that it will play in reducing the deficit.”

Republicans who caricatured Pelosi as a “San Francisco liberal” were only half right. It’s true that she was a committed partisan, a New Deal Democrat in the mold of her father, three-term Baltimore mayor Tommy D’Alesandro Jr. Ensuring health coverage for all Americans was also a mission she saw as consistent with the lessons she learned from the nuns who had taught her at the Institute of Notre Dame in Baltimore and Trinity College in Washington. It was a matter of social justice, of following Jesus’s imperative to care for the least among us. (Kathleen Sebelius was another Trinity graduate; they dubbed themselves “the Trinity sisters,” at one point to the confusion of Obama, who looked around a meeting to find the nuns they were discussing.)

But what that description missed was the fact that there were two sides to Pelosi’s political core: the progressive and the pragmatist. She was not only a San Francisco liberal; she was also a Baltimore pol. In that, she was following in her father’s footsteps as well. No other battle during her political career illustrated that duality more clearly than the debate over the Affordable Care Act. She insisted on a sweeping bill, despite the long odds. But she was willing to push through a version she saw as flawed when it became the only prospect available.

She understood “that you get as much as you can when you can get it, and then you keep moving on and build on that,” Obama told me. By then, he said, they both knew the 2010 midterm elections were going to be tough for congressional Democrats. Winning on the Affordable Care Act could mean losing her Speakership."	left
knw9o1	obama	Barack Obama shares Valentino Dixon's story with his 34 million Instagram followers	"BUFFALO, N.Y. (WKBW) — At least 34 million people more people know about Valentino Dixon's story, thanks to former President Barack Obama.

On Wednesday, Obama posted a picture on Instagram of him receiving Dixon's artwork from Michelle Obama for Christmas. An image of the 20"" x 30"" drawing was shown to him on his tablet, as the former First Family celebrated Christmas in Hawaii.

""It's an incredible piece, but the story behind it is even better,"" Obama wrote in the caption.

Within an hour of being posted, the picture already had more than 400,000 likes.

""Valentino grew up in Buffalo, New York, and developed a great skill and passion for drawing from a young age,"" wrote Obama. ""Unfortunately, when he was 21, he was wrongfully convicted for a crime he didn't commit and sentenced to a minimum of 38 1/2 years in prison.""

A judge vacated Dixon's murder conviction in September 2018. But to get to that point, a team from Georgetown University spent years re-examining evidence in the case, and Golf Digest was helping Dixon's profile grow through stories about his drawings in the magazine.

""Today, Valentino travels extensively to share his story and promote the need for criminal justice reform. And thankfully, for me and for so many others, he continues to draw,"" wrote Mr. Obama.

7 Eyewitness News was first to share that the former First Lady had purchased one of Dixon's drawings as a Christmas gift to President Obama. She had seen his story on HBO's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel, and wanted to surprise Obama with a golf drawing, according to Dixon, who sold Mrs. Obama a picture of the 12th hole of Augusta National Golf Club.

""I'm so proud to have one of his works to display,"" wrote Obama.

When 7 Eyewitness News asked Dixon about the significance of Mrs. Obama's purchase, he said ""it doesn't get any better.""

It might just have gotten a little bit better. Consider this the icing on the cake.

“I’ve consulted with the finest constitutional lawyers in the country,” Senator John Cornyn, of Texas, said. “Without exception, they determined that the enforcement measures that the Framers created, in 1787, were intended only to be used in cases of Hillary.”

Senator Josh Hawley, of Missouri, concurred. “To see legal guardrails that James Madison explicitly designed for Hillary Clinton used on someone who is demonstrably not Hillary Clinton is a disgrace,” he said.

Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, struck a more conciliatory note, suggesting that there were circumstances under which Senate Republicans might support an impeachment trial next month. “If a decision were made to put Hillary Clinton on trial, we would be on board with that,” he said.

jmukb1	hillaryclinton	Hillary Clinton Was Right to Warn Us — She grasped the danger posed by the “vast right-wing conspiracy,” Russian interference and Trump.	"This is the thing, if you go back and review Hillary’s speeches and tweets and debate performances from 2016: She was right about an awful lot. Not about everything. She had her share of lulus, like predicting that the election of Trump would set off a global financial panic and plunge the economy into a recession. (Oops. Took a pandemic to do that.)

But she did have some strikingly good insights. You see it in the “she warned us” memes on Twitter: Here’s the snippet of her listing possible reasons Trump hadn’t released his tax returns (he’s a tax evader, he’s in hock to mysterious creditors, he’s not the bazilionaire we think), all of which turned out to be true; there’s the snippet of Hillary telling Trump that he was a puppet, which is worth reading in fuller context:

TRUMP: … from everything I see, [Putin] has no respect for this person. CLINTON: Well, that’s because he’d rather have a puppet as president of the United States. TRUMP: No puppet. No puppet. CLINTON: And it’s pretty clear … TRUMP: You’re the puppet! CLINTON: It’s pretty clear you won’t admit … TRUMP: No, you’re the puppet. CLINTON: … that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race. So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation. We’ve never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election. We have 17 — 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election. I find that deeply disturbing.

Two weeks ago, Hillary slyly said her own polite version of I-told-you-so. “In my case, there’s a whole speech for everything,” she tweeted above a screenshot of this especially pungent quote from 2016:

Now, just imagine if you can. Donald Trump sitting in the Oval Office, the next time America faces a crisis. Imagine him being in charge when your jobs and savings are at stake. Is this who you want to lead us in an emergency? Someone thin skinned and quick to anger who’d likely be on Twitter attacking reporters or bringing the whole regulatory system down on his critics when he should be focused on fixing what’s wrong? Would he even know what to do?

Yet it never mattered. She couldn’t get enough voters to listen.

Why was this?

Tiresome to say, but part of it can be chalked up to gender. Novelists and Hollywood writers may create delightful female know-it-alls, from Elizabeth Bennet to Hermione Granger to Olivia Pope. But they seldom get happy endings in real life. In real life, such women are often despised precisely because they are right.

And if you reread Hillary’s speeches, you can see that her words were really unsparing and precise. She wasn’t shyly hiding her erudition. To wit: “Donald Trump doesn’t know the first thing about Iran or its nuclear program. Ask him. It’ll become very clear, very quickly.” Or: “There is a difference between getting tough on trade and recklessly starting trade wars.” In “What Happened,” she compares Putin to a subway manspreader.

Talk about a guy who had a problem with powerful ladies. After Hillary criticized one of his policies, Putin told the press, “It’s better not to argue with women.”

But some of the reasons Hillary’s warnings may have gone unheeded were more idiosyncratic. Early in her career, she tested good people’s patience not with her rightness, but with her self-righteousness. The former Senator Bill Bradley comes to mind: Decades ago, she batted away his request for a more realistic health care reform bill, adding that the Clinton administration would “demonize” anyone who stood in its way. “That was it for me,” Bradley told Carl Bernstein, “in terms of Hillary Clinton.”"	left

The fly stayed on Pence’s head for about two minutes in the second half of the debate before flying away.

The moment sparked a plethora of viral memes on Twitter late Wednesday and drew jokes from members of Congress.

Biden also joked about the moment in a fundraising tweet.

A similar moment happened during a 2016 presidential debate between Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, and President Trump, then the Republican nominee — though it didn’t last nearly as long.

For about a split-second during the debate, a fly landed on Clinton’s eyebrow.

A Twitter user made an account for the fly, with the handle “Hillary’s Fly,” at the time, tweeting a picture of the moment with the caption: “Showing my support for Hillary! I can't believe I'm on TV!”

And this year was no different.

Hours after the debate, an account made for the fly that landed on Pence’s head had more than 107,000 followers.

“That was awful,” the account’s first tweet reads. Another tweet posted later in the night asked, “wait do i have covid now?”

hrov0z	hillaryclinton	Hillary Clinton on 'Daily Show': Americans should 'be ready' if Trump won’t ‘go quietly’ after election	"Hillary Clinton appeared as a guest on Monday’s episode of “The Daily Show” where host Trevor Noah asked the former secretary of state about the potential changing of powers at the White House after November's election.

The former Democratic presidential nominee appeared virtually for an interview on what Noah has been calling “The Daily Social Distancing Show” amid the coronavirus pandemic. Their friendly interview quickly turned to the topic of voter suppression, with Clinton taking a jab at Republican leaders, alleging they’re trying to stifle votes from people they believe will vote blue in November.

“Republicans have two prongs to their strategy to try to win,” she explained. “The first is to try to prevent as many people who they think won’t vote for them from voting. So make the lines really long where young people vote or African-Americans vote or Hispanics vote. Try to make vote-by-mail as difficult as possible. Claim it’s fraudulent when indeed it’s not. In fact, that’s how Donald Trump votes and everybody who knows about vote-by-mail understands that.”

TREVOR NOAH’S TRUMP-BASHING OVER CORONAVIRUS WINS HIM FANS – IN CHINA

With that, Noah asked if she believes President Trump, who has repeatedly said in the past that voter fraud is an issue with voting by mail, will attempt to use the vast number of Americans likely to vote by mail in November due to the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to delegitimize the election and refuse to yield power in the event he loses.

“I think it is a fair point to raise as to whether or not, if he loses, he’s going to go quietly or not. We have to be ready for that,” she cautioned. “But there have been so many academic studies and other analyses that point out that it’s just an inaccurate, fraudulent claim. There isn’t that problem.”

Clinton added: “All the games that are played and all the photo IDs and any kind of restriction that can be imposed to try to keep the vote down in places that aren’t going to vote for Republicans, that’s the real danger to the integrity of our election. That combined with misinformation and disinformation and all the online shenanigans that we saw in 2016.”

Clinton concluded her thoughts on voter suppression and Trump potentially refusing to yield power by saying that, above all, she simply wants a fair and honest election.

TREVOR NOAH THINKS PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD MAKE COMEDIANS' JOBS 'HARDER'

“I want a fair election. If people get to vote and they, for whatever reason, vote for Donald Trump, OK. We’ll accept it. Not happily,” she said with a laugh. “But I don’t think that’s what will happen because I think the more people that can get to the poles, whether by mail or in person, and get their votes counted, then we’re going to have the kind of election we should have and then it’ll be a win both in the popular vote and in the electoral college.”

Later in the interview, Clinton pulled no punches when talking about Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, making it clear that she blames his “lack of leadership” for the U.S. having some of the highest infection rates.

“You have to start with President Trump’s total hostility toward science, evidence, facts, logic, reason. He is a showman. He is a reality TV star. He likes to try to bend reality to suit his own preferences. And he clearly started hearing about this back in January through intelligence briefings that he either read or didn’t read,” she said. “But even before that he had disbanded the unit within the National Security Council that would try to get ahead of and follow the development of pandemics abroad. He had really made it clear that he was more interested in the optics than the facts when the virus first hit and he kept saying, ‘We have 15 cases, it’ll be over soon.’”

She concluded: “So, you’ve got to begin and end with his total lack of leadership. His indifference toward what this virus has cost us, not only in lives but in jobs and livelihoods. Now of course he doesn’t want to hear from our leading infectious disease experts like Dr. Fauci. He doesn’t want to hold even the sham of the meetings he used to hold to try and talk about it. He’s hoping that it either goes away or leaves our attention span so that he can get back to pretending to be president.”"	left

hkl9dg	hillaryclinton	"An Hour-Long Interview With Hillary Rodham Clinton: ""I will tell you, it's frustrating to be on the sidelines in a pandemic"""	"“I will tell you, it’s frustrating to be on the sidelines in a pandemic,” Hillary Rodham Clinton tells me via teleconference from the home in Chappaqua, New York, that she shares with her husband, former president Bill Clinton, as we record an episode of The Hollywood Reporter‘s ‘Awards Chatter’ podcast. “But I’m trying — through speaking out, and raising money for groups and candidates, and doing everything I can — to stay as involved as possible, even at a distance.”

Clinton, of course, is far more accustomed to being centrally involved in solving major problems facing Americans, having served as First Lady (1993-2001), United States Senator (2001-2009), Secretary of State (2009-2013), and been a candidate for president (2008 and 2016). But since her shocking loss to Donald Trump in 2016, she has largely stepped away from the spotlight — except to attend Trump’s inauguration (she says his speech was “dreadful”), to release a memoir entitled What Happened, to endorse the 2020 candidacy of Joe Biden and to appear in a four-part docuseries about her life and times that was directed by the Oscar-nominated filmmaker Nanette Burstein and entitled Hillary.

Hillary began streaming on Hulu on March 6, has been very well received and on Monday was named the year’s best limited documentary series by the Critics’ Choice Real TV Awards. With Emmy voting getting underway on Thursday, Hillary, now 72, agreed to an hourlong conversation with The Hollywood Reporter about the docuseries, as well as the rollercoaster life and tumultuous times that it chronicles. You can hear the entire conversation — and read key excerpts — below.

* * *

Past guests include Steven Spielberg, Oprah Winfrey, Lorne Michaels, Barbra Streisand, George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Robert De Niro, Jennifer Lawrence, Eddie Murphy, Gal Gadot, Warren Beatty, Angelina Jolie, Snoop Dogg, Jessica Chastain, Stephen Colbert, Reese Witherspoon, Aaron Sorkin, Margot Robbie, Ryan Reynolds, Nicole Kidman, Denzel Washington, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Matthew McConaughey, Kate Winslet, Jimmy Kimmel, Natalie Portman, Chadwick Boseman, Jennifer Lopez, Elton John, Judi Dench, Quincy Jones, Jane Fonda, Tom Hanks, Amy Schumer, Justin Timberlake, Elisabeth Moss, RuPaul, Rachel Brosnahan, Jimmy Fallon, Kris Jenner, Michael Moore, Emilia Clarke, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Helen Mirren, Tyler Perry, Sally Field, Spike Lee, Lady Gaga, J.J. Abrams, Emma Stone, Al Pacino, Julia Roberts, Jerry Seinfeld, Dolly Parton, Will Smith, Taraji P. Henson, Sacha Baron Cohen, Carol Burnett and Norman Lear.

* * *

How did the docuseries come about? “After 2016, I was approached about doing a kind of retrospective documentary about the campaign. We had about 2,000 hours of behind-the-scenes footage that this very dedicated team of young videographers and filmmakers had put together — they followed me around, and it was really like the fly on the wall, you forgot they were there, so they got a lot of really interesting stories that they captured. And I thought, ‘Well, okay, we’ll do that.’ What was originally envisioned as a campaign doc — not unlike The War Room, the 1993 doc about Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign — instead became something broader after Burstein was hired. “She came back after looking at all that footage and said, ‘Look, there’s a much bigger story here. There is the story of your life, but it’s also the story of women’s lives, it’s the story of American politics over the last 50-plus years, and that’s the story I want to tell. Would you cooperate with that?’ And, for the first time in decades, I wasn’t running for something, I wasn’t in public office and I said, ‘Okay, I will.’ And I think my answer, Scott, to be honest, surprised me a little bit when it came out of my mouth.'”

What was it like being interviewed by Burstein for 35 hours over seven days, with all subjects — including Monica Lewinsky — on the table? “I will confess, there were moments when it was harder than others and it was a very intense experience.”

What was it like to see the finished docuseries? “The first time I saw it was like an out-of-body experience.” It was also her first time seeing one piece of footage that she had only heard about before. “Sitting there, watching this, and seeing myself burned in effigy, given what’s going on in the world today and how really crazy and scary the time can be, I was like, ‘Wow, what was going on then, and what is going on now, that trying to get universal healthcare provokes that level of hatred?'”

Who were her role models as a child? “When I was a young girl, I did not know any women who worked outside the home, personally, other than my teachers and the public school librarians, so there were not images or real-life role models that I could look to.”

Why was she so disappointed, as a child, to be told by NASA that she could not work for them? “To be told I couldn’t do something because I was a girl? That had never happened to me before, and that was a real eye-opener.”

Why is Eleanor Roosevelt one of her heroes? “The more I learned about her, the more I admired her… She said, ‘No one can make you feel inferior without your permission.’ So she’s always been a kind of North Star to me.”

If she had not followed her law school classmate and boyfriend Bill Clinton to Arkansas in 1974 and married him in 1975, would she ultimately have been more or less successful in politics? “I find it impossible to answer… I did follow my heart to Arkansas… We were both considered top lawyers under 40, we were both perceived as having incredible futures, but I never saw myself as a political candidate. I saw myself as an activist.”

How has she managed to handle decades of criticism — of her name, voice, clothes — and accusations of impropriety? “I had to learn early on in Bill’s political career to take criticism seriously but not personally. There are things you can learn from your critics because sometimes your friends won’t tell you that you’re messing up or that you could do something better — sometimes the critics have a point. But you cannot allow criticism to literally undermine your self-confidence and to destroy your own ideas and your dreams… So much of that is rooted — let’s be clear here — in misogyny and sexism. Everybody has an opinion about a woman in the public arena.”

Why did she and other members of her family socialize with Donald Trump in the years prior to 2016, including attending his 2005 wedding in Florida? “Those were encounters that were not very many and not of great moment, certainly to me. We all lived in New York. We all encountered each other. And until he became a Republican, Donald Trump supported Democrats in the New York delegation and elsewhere in the country. And, you know, literally, we were invited to his wedding, and Bill was making a speech in Palm Beach, and I thought, ‘Wow, I’m gonna go see what this is about’… I don’t know what happened to the person who supported Democrats and then became a ‘birther,’ questioning, you know, President Obama’s birth certificate, and then became a virulently anti-immigrant candidate, when he had used immigrant labor for everything he built. I don’t know. It was all opportunistic. So yeah, I did know him, just like I know, you know, literally hundreds of thousands of people.”

During or after the 2016 race, did she ever fear that Trump would actually “lock her up”? “I didn’t know what he was capable of… Look, if I had ever done anything wrong, he would have gone after me. Let me put it that way. You know, I’ve never done anything wrong. I’m, you know, as some people like to say, the most investigated, exonerated person in recent history. But if he could have found anything that he thought could impose some kind of cost on me — because, at the root of this, Scott, is he fears that his win — that narrow win in the Electoral College — was not legitimate. Part of what he does in the way he lashes out is because, deep down, he knows the Russians helped him, despite his incredible efforts to deny it. He knows WikiLeaks helped him. He understands all of that. So if he could [have gone after me] — as he has tried to do, to go after people all the time, and thankfully without a lot of success — he would have, because he’s a vindictive score-settler and he doesn’t want the legitimacy of his election ever to be questioned, although history will continue to question it. So, thankfully, you know, I never did anything that gave him any cause, despite his best efforts.”

Was she aware of the misinformation about her that was spread on social media in 2016? “I was dying. I was endlessly dying. I was constantly dying. In fact, this interview, you are interviewing a ghost.”

How big a problem is ? “We are divided by sources of information… If you create algorithms for Facebook, controversy drives more clicks, conspiracies are just manna from Heaven, they will get people’s attention… I’m also impressed by this latest effort called [Stop] Hate For Profit where advertisers are pulling their advertising from Facebook. Facebook has to be held accountable because they trafficked in conspiracy, they trafficked in misinformation, they trafficked in Russian disinformation, and they’ve got to be held accountable because we’re gonna have another election, and everybody should know what’s at stake and then cast their vote accordingly.”

Is it possible that in 2016 Russians influenced not only voters but vote counts? “There are still a lot of unanswered questions about what they were doing probing registration bases and what they were doing probing election systems. So far, that has not been nailed down. But the influence certainly has.”

What advice would she give pre-2016 election Hillary if she could go back in time? “The thing that I look back on is the difficulty we had in defending against the action that [then-FBI director James] Comey took 10 days out from the election putting out a statement that I was being investigated again, even though it tunred out there was nothing new there and there was no there there. I would have figured out a better way of countering that, because it really did raise understandable questions in voters’ minds, and I watched internally as my numbers dropped in key places like Pennsylvania because, all of a sudden, this was back in the news. So if we could have figured out a better way to counter that and not let it drag on.”

Would she have handled the current moment of crisis better than Trump has? “We wouldn’t have been able to stop the pandemic at our borders the way that Trump claimed in the beginning, but we sure could have done a better job saving lives, modeling better, more responsible behavior. I don’t think we necessarily should have had as deep an economic assault on livelihoods and jobs as we have. So I know I would have done a better job.”

If Trump is defeated in 2020, does she think he will leave the White House without a fight? “I don’t know the answer to that yet. I think it depends upon how big the loss is, and that’s why they’re doing everything they can to prevent people from voting — you know, they want to stop mail-in voting, they want to shrink the number of places where people can actually vote in person — because they know if we have a big turnout, they lose. And so we’re gonna have lots of fights over actual voting procedures between now and November. And if they can do anything that makes it look questionable, they will. And that’s why everybody needs to come out and vote — I don’t care where you live — and have as big a turnout as possible so that there can’t be any excuse given.”

Should Trump be ‘locked up’ after he leaves office? “I believe in the rule of law. If there’s evidence that he should be investigated, then hopefully a non-partisan, very deliberative process would be used, not what we’re seeing in the current Justice Department, which is undermining the rule of law and our institutions.”

Would she beat Trump if she were on the ballot again in November? “Yes. But I think people believe that this is a referendum on him.”

Will she ever run for president again? “No. Not in the cards.”"	left

hi3vcx	hillaryclinton	Reddit bans pro-Trump forum in crackdown on hate speech	"Twitch, a subsidiary of the e-commerce giant Amazon, confirmed on Monday that it has separately suspended Trump's campaign channel on the platform for posting videos that ran afoul of its rules against content that “promotes, encourages or facilitates discrimination, denigration, objectification, harassment or violence” based on an individual’s identity.

A company spokesperson said the channel violated its rules by rebroadcasting a video of Trump's 2015 event kicking off his presidential candidacy, in which he referred to Mexican immigrants as “rapists."" At the time, Trump said, ""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best,"" adding, ""They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.""

Twitch said a separate video of Trump’s latest campaign rally in Tulsa, Okla., in which he describes a hypothetical scenario where “very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away” also violated those policies.

“Hateful conduct is not allowed on Twitch,” the spokesperson told POLITICO in a statement. “In line with our policies, President Trump’s channel has been issued a temporary suspension from Twitch for comments made on stream, and the offending content has been removed.”

Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh responded to the two companies' actions by urging voters who want to ""hear directly from the President"" to download the campaign's app. A White House spokesperson did not offer comment.

Twitch's and Reddit's actions comes as larger rival Facebook faces a tsunami of criticism from Democrats and civil rights advocates and praise from Republicans for declining to take action against a post by Trump that threatened violence against protesters decrying police violence and racial injustice. Facebook’s decision triggered internal strife at the social media behemoth and sparked a major advertising boycott that has seen brands, including Verizon and Coca-Cola, pull messages from the platform.

Amid the intense scrutiny, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Friday that the company is expanding its policies against calls to incite violence and voter suppression and may add labels to some offending posts by political leaders, such as Trump, that run afoul of its rules.

The incidents have created an inflection point for Facebook and other social media giants, which are also under pressure to address racial inequities amid the recent wave of protests against police violence in the wake of George Floyd’s killing while in police custody in Minnesota. Twitter has drawn praise from liberal lawmakers and rebukes from Trump and his conservative allies for adding fact-checking and warning labels to a series of inflammatory Trump tweets.

But the debate about whether to penalize rule-breaking content from the president and his supporters is also dragging in a host of other social media platforms.

Reddit already dealt a major blow to the pro-Trump subreddit last year by severely restricting its visibility and functionality over “repeated rule-breaking” through a process known as quarantining. The community has long been plagued by racist, xenophobic and other derogatory content, and Reddit has faced public pressure for years for not doing more to rein in conduct on the channel.

As part of Monday’s move, Huffman said Reddit is also expanding its policies against hateful conduct, which he said will now explicitly state that “communities and users that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.” Reddit’s policies up until now explicitly banned users and communities from inciting violence, but not hateful conduct based on people’s identity.

Huffman said Monday that Reddit is also banning the r/ChapoTrapHouse subreddit, a popular left-wing community with over 160,000 subscribers, for “consistently” hosting rule-breaking content and because their moderators “have demonstrated no intention of reigning in their community.” Huffman said of the 2,000 communities banned, a vast majority were inactive, with only 200 of them currently having more than 10 active daily users.

“To be clear, views across the political spectrum are allowed on Reddit — but all communities must work within our policies and do so in good faith, without exception,” Huffman said.

hhi7hd	hillaryclinton	Hillary Clinton was right	"Now, before the 100-percent-proof progressives – who consider the former first lady and failed presidential candidate the “devil in a designer pantsuit” – have a fit of apoplexy or crucify yours truly for being an apostate, let me explain what I am convinced Hillary Clinton was right about and why.

Still, I am obliged to remind readers that in opinion columns for Al Jazeera and elsewhere, my antipathy for Clinton’s regressive credentials at home and signature support for America’s inhumane and calamitous “shock and awe” adventures abroad is plain.

But I am also obliged to give credit when and where credit is due.

You may recall during a dinner in 2016 to raise money for her bid to become president, Clinton made some uncharitable remarks about many, not all, of President Donald Trump’s supporters and, by implication, her opponent.

Clinton shared with her well-heeled admirers a blunt, stinging precis on the essential character of not only Trump, but the people who attended his “rallies” that pulsated with incendiary anger and indecency.

“You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump’s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right?” Clinton said. “The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic – you name it. And unfortunately, there are people like that. And he has lifted them up.”

That is not all Clinton said.

“[Trump] tweets and retweets their offensive hateful mean-spirited rhetoric. Now, some of those folks – they are irredeemable, but thankfully they are not America.”

Clinton was right on every count. Trump, his followers and enablers inside and outside Congress are indeed an “irredeemable” “basket of deplorables” and, since his election in 2016, they have confirmed, time and again, every wretched quality she ascribed to them in her scathing address.

It would be an exercise in redundancy to describe or tally the familiar litany of appalling acts committed by Trump and his vulgar allies. The evidence of their irredeemably deplorable behaviour is, today, glaring and overwhelming.

Yet, at the time, Clinton’s caustic comments were condemned as a politically unwise and irresponsible ad hominem attack on Americans she claimed to want to lead as commander-in-chief.

I believed then, as I do now, that Clinton’s surprising candour – however fleeting or novel – was refreshing and laudable. As an adjunct to this, I found Clinton’s critics hypocritical in their condescending reproach of her remarks and too genteel to tell the blatant truth about the sinister Make-America-Great-Again, baseball-cap-wearing crowd.

Rather, the all-knowing-all-the-time pundits scolded Clinton for being a stiff, calculating candidate who lacked authenticity and spontaneity.

Clinton’s speech may have had a calculating tint, but it was, arguably, the most authentic moment of her campaign. It is memorable precisely because it was a remarkable and unexpected departure of form. (Reportedly, she had previously road-tested the “deplorables” line in an interview with an Israeli news station.)

In that moment, before that audience, Clinton opted to say out loud what many other politicians were hesitant to say out loud to avoid alienating Trump’s “base” in a futile and ludicrous bid to win their favour. Clearly, Clinton did not share their equivocations or reservations. Bully for her. (Joe Biden acknowledged recently that 10-15 percent of Americans “are just not very good people”. I think he was being conservative.)

Turns out, Clinton was as prescient as she was right.

These days, it is fashionable for previously circumspect writers to finally and enthusiastically invoke Clinton’s once verboten language in columns that explore what attracts and binds Trumpsters to Trump.

More learned scribes turn to the incisive tomes of renowned psychoanalysts like Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung to try to analyse the pathology that defines Trump and the evangelical loyalty he inspires.

“They feel caricaturized and vilified, and in many ways, they are and have been for decades now,” one repentant, ex-“I hate Trump voters” columnist explained. “These people are frightened, frustrated, and suffering.”

Here is, I suppose, my unembroidered, insensitive reply: Just as sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, a deplorable Trumpster can sometimes just be deplorable.

By any sentient measure, it is deplorable to not only traffic in a cesspool of conspiracy theories about the origins a still raging pandemic that has claimed the lives of more than 120,000 Americans, but to declare the virus a “hoax” orchestrated by scientists intent on depriving deplorables of a haircut.

By any sentient measure, it is deplorable to carry big, loaded automatic weapons into statehouses and claim, often incoherently, that an overt act of intimidation is somehow a reflection of the “freedoms” enshrined in the US constitution.

By any sentient measure, it is deplorable to tar, often incoherently, millions of Americans demanding an end to police brutality and ingrained, systemic racism as “terrorists” or “wild animals” who need to be “put down”.

By any sentient measure, it is deplorable to insist that yet another murder of yet another Black man by police warrants the US president and his complicit accomplices to threaten to deploy the military to shoot Americans protesting against George Floyd’s murder.

I could go on and on and on, but I expect you get the deplorable point.

There are, predictably, progressives who refuse to call a deplorable spade a deplorable spade. Instead, they cling to the absurd.

“What’s with those US protesters? The ones out to end the lockdown so they can return to work and get fatally infected. Crazy? That’s not very empathetic. The best explanation I’ve heard is, they’re people who’ve been lied to by experts for 40 years about what’s good for them, like free trade or privatization (as in senior care), and it was all dishonest verbal garbage that destroyed jobs and communities,” another columnist recently wrote.

The paragraph’s logic, such as it is, escapes me. To suggest that repudiating epidemiologists’ advice to wear a mask and social distance somehow reflects a mass epiphany by the deplorables that “experts” have habitually lied “about what’s good for them” is a laughable affront to reality.

I cannot recall a deplorable ever saying: “I refuse to wear a mask to protect me and others from a hoax virus because all those experts lied to me about free trade and privatization.” Can you?

I am through attempting to understand or tolerate any sympathy, from any quarter, for a deplorable clan who plan to vote for a deplorable clan leader this coming November.

If that makes Trump’s rabid deplorables call me deplorable – well, so be it.

jetm4i	hillaryclinton	The Hunter Biden Laptop ‘Scandal’ is a Giant Nothing-Burger	"Despite the allegations being disproven repeatedly, the Biden-Laptop story continues to grow among Trump’s most delusional supporters. In fact, it may be more dangerous now that it is debunked.

By David Icke Turner

Falling behind in the polls and expected to lose the election, President Trump and his allies are throwing Hail-Mary passes in the final quarter. The most high profile of this last minute attempt to derail Biden is in the form of the Hunter Biden Laptop ‘Scandal.’ The entire controversy was launched by a New York Post article which was prompted by none other than Steve Bannon. Bannon reportedly provided the alleged laptop contents.

The meat and potatoes of the story go like this: At some point in 2019, Hunter Biden decided to drop off a laptop for repair in a state he did not live in to a repair shop managed by a blind man. According to the New York Post article, this laptop allegedly contained incriminating evidence regarding correspondence with Ukrainian officials where Biden’s illegally peddled influence. The allegations by the Post have been disproven by innumerable, reputable media sources. Further, nobody has authenticated that any of the emails the Post alleges are Hunter Biden’s are indeed his. There is no accompanying metadata, the man who alleges Biden dropped the laptop at his Delaware shop is blind, and the whole of the data capture has not been handed over to any reputable media source for examination. Therein lies the danger.

You see, in the land of make believe and top-of-the-dome conspiracy, a disjointed and baseless accusation can be more dangerous than a substantive allegation. Conspiracies are underpinned by speculation; hence the less the evidence the better. True to 2020 conspiracy form, the original accusations of corrupt dealings with Ukrainian officials have morphed into allegations that the laptop contains videos of Hunter Biden smoking crack and of him raping a young Chinese girl.

To be clear, none of this is in the vicinity of being substantiated. Russian fingerprints on this story of vast and credible — So much so that the FBI is currently investigating any Russian connections with the data. Putin also has every interest in throwing a monkey wrench into U.S.-Ukrainian relations. According to Slate, “There are also strong indicators that Russia had something to do with this whole affair, though nothing has surfaced definitively proving this is the case. In January, the same Russian intelligence unit that hacked Hillary Clinton’s and the Democratic National Committee’s emails in 2016 was also able to infiltrate Burisma’s systems. U.S. intelligence analysts subsequently picked up chatter indicating that stolen Burisma emails would be leaked as part of an October surprise aimed at influencing the election. Analysts were further concerned that forged materials might be included in the leak—something that, without the original materials in question, journalists can’t verify for themselves, leaving everyone to take the New York Post’s word. (And, in case you forgot, U.S. intelligence agencies once again say Russia is trying to tilt the election in favor of Trump.)”

Yet Bannon and his goons did well to include connections with Hunter Biden’s confirmed drug use. All lines of bullshit are presented with smatterings of truth. Joe Biden has on many occasions referenced his son’s battle with addiction. One of the most poignant moments in the last debate was when Biden defended his son and his previous battles with cocaine abuse. However, do not let intimation of truth rutter the narrative here. The allegations by the Post and others have been repeatedly disproven. It is a nothing-burger. It is an impotent October Surprise by a President that is flailing in the face of a lost election. It’s possible more absurdities will follow and there could be a tangible impact or maybe data’s origins will further incriminate Bannon/Trump. Ultimately, it is a last ditch effort of an incompetent and incapable President to address the imminent deaths of another 200,000 of his compatriots before year’s end."	left

l03a6c	hillaryclinton	Hillary Clinton speaks with Speaker Pelosi about the insurrection at the Capitol in new episode of podcast	"Bonus Episode: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi

By iHeartRadio

The week after the attack on the Capitol, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi joins Hillary for a candid, no-holds-barred conversation. In a detailed firsthand account of what Speaker Pelosi and her House members experienced that day, she shares how she felt when she learned what was happening, her takeaways from her call with Vice President Pence amidst the chaos and violence, and why she was so determined to resume congressional business the second it was safe to do so. They also talk about what needs to happen to ensure that those responsible are held to account, how we got here, and what a new administration can do to address the many challenges facing the country.

le5014	hillaryclinton	QAnon Believers Are Obsessed With Hillary Clinton. She Has Thoughts.	"The people Weiss wrote about targeted both Clintons, but there was always a special venom reserved for Hillary, seen as a feminist succubus out to annihilate traditional family relations. An attendee at the 1996 Republican National Convention told the feminist writer Susan Faludi, “It’s well-established that Hillary Clinton belonged to a satanic cult, still does.” Running for Congress in 2014, Ryan Zinke, who would later become Trump’s secretary of the interior, described her as “the Antichrist.” (He later said he was joking.) Trump himself called Clinton “the Devil.”

For Clinton, these supernatural smears are part of an old story. “This is rooted in ancient scapegoating of women, of doing everything to undermine women in the public arena, women with their own voices, women who speak up against power and the patriarchy,” she said. “This is a Salem Witch Trials line of argument against independent, outspoken, pushy women. And it began to metastasize around me.” In this sense, Frazzledrip is just a particularly disgusting version of misogynist hatred she’s always contended with.

Nor is the claim that she’s a murderer new; it’s been an article of faith on the right ever since the 1993 suicide of Vince Foster, an aide to Bill Clinton and a close friend of Hillary’s. Recently I spoke to Preston Crow, who, when he was a graduate student in 1994, created one of the first anti-Clinton websites, where he posted about things like the “Clinton body count.” (He has since become a Democrat, and he voted for Hillary in 2016.) “Once you start following the conspiracy theories, it’s fairly similar,” he told me. “QAnon took it several steps farther.”

Greene now claims that she no longer believes in QAnon. In a speech on Thursday, before the House voted to strip her of her committee assignments, she blamed her claims that leading Democrats deserve to die for their role in a diabolic pedophile ring on her inability to trust the mainstream media. “I was allowed to believe things that weren’t true,” she said.

To my surprise, Clinton thought Greene’s passive account of her own radicalization wasn’t entirely absurd. “We are facing a mass addiction with the effective purveying of disinformation on social media,” Clinton said. “I don’t have one iota of sympathy for someone like her, but the algorithms, we are now understanding more than ever we could have, truly are addictive. And whatever it is in our brains for people who go down those rabbit holes, and begin to inhabit this alternative reality, they are, in effect, made to believe.”

Clinton now thinks that the creation and promotion of this alternative reality, enabled and incentivized by the tech platforms, is, as she put it, “the primary event of our time.” Nothing about QAnon or Marjorie Taylor Greene is entirely new. Social media has just taken the dysfunction that was already in our politics, and rendered it uglier than anyone ever imagined."	left

jg2nb9	hillaryclinton	Book by Ruth Bader Ginsburg Coming in 2021	"The University of California Press will publish a book co-authored by the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg next year, the Associated Press reports.

Ginsburg’s Justice, Justice Thou Shalt Pursue: A Life's Work Fighting for a More Perfect Union, co-written with law professor Amanda L. Tyler, will be published by the university press next spring.

“In this collection, the two bring together [their] conversation and other materials—many previously unpublished—that share details from Justice Ginsburg's family life and long career,” the publisher says on a webpage for the book. “These include notable briefs and oral arguments, some of Ginsburg's last speeches, and her favorite opinions that she wrote as a Supreme Court justice (many in dissent), along with the statements that she read from the bench in those important cases.”

Tyler, a former clerk for Ginsburg, said collaborating with the justice was a “special privilege.

“As we exchanged drafts of various parts of this book, the Justice was every bit as rigorous an editor as she had been 20 years ago when I clerked for her,” Tyler said. “Right up until the end, she was still teaching me about the craft of writing, how important precision is, and to never use four words when three will do.”

Ginsburg’s previous books include a memoir, My Own Words, and the anthology Decisions and Dissents of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, which was published just 10 days before her death in September.

Justice, Justice Thou Shalt Pursue is slated for publication in March of 2021.

George Floyd memorial mural in Minneapolis near the location of his murder. Photo by author.

Police officers, tasked to protect, continue to commit crimes against members of their communities. We despair that it’s driven by deep-rooted racism, which will take generations to end. But the acute problem isn’t individual racist officers. The problem is so much broader and yet so much more addressable than that — our police are permitted to operate above the law.

We don’t need to wait generations for the string of murders like George Floyd’s to end. We can help end this now.

Derek Chauvin, the officer who murdered George Floyd, had at least 17 complaints against him. 17. In one incident, he shot an unarmed man, in the man’s own home, twice in the abdomen. None of that derailed his career, much less resulted in criminal charges. If he happened to be racist or enjoy power trips, why wouldn’t he indulge?

Four days after the murder of George Floyd, the police arrested Omar Jimenez, a black CNN correspondent on live TV. There’s live footage of him showing his credentials. He and other crew members were held in custody for over an hour.

The Minneapolis State Patrol’s statement after the fact: “The three [members of the CNN crew] were released once they were confirmed to be members of the media.”

The police are willing to blatantly mislead the public even when there is live footage showing the truth. You don’t think they masked facts to cover up Derek Chauvin’s past use of excessive force, making it harder for him to be fired or prosecuted?

There will always be people who, unchecked, will make the world worse off. They can be driven by self-interest, racism, pleasure in exerting power, or any number of other things. You know what holds them in check? The law.

Police cannot be any different. Police cannot be above the law. I understand the deep loyalty police officers must feel to each other. But they cannot stop pursuing the truth just because a fellow officer is involved. I know unions exist to protect the interests of police officers. But they cannot protect officers to the point of undermining public safety. I know prosecutors have strong relationships with police. But they cannot uphold the law differently (or not at all) just because the perpetrator is a police officer.

—

Police cannot be above the law. In fact, they should be held to an even higher standard, given the power they are entrusted with. Arresting Derek Chauvin was just a minuscule step toward change. We can and must see structural change in the coming months:

1. Remove police who have used excessive force

Derek Chauvin received at least 17 previous conduct complaints

Fire officers, like Derek Chauvin, who have a repeated history of using excessive force

Take disciplinary action or fire officers who have stood by while a fellow officer used excessive force

Remove policies, instituted by unions or otherwise, that prevented officers like Derek Chauvin from being disciplined and fired for use of excessive force

2. Take disciplinary action for cover-up attempts

Minneapolis State Patrol stated “The three [CNN crew members] were released once they were confirmed to be members of the media.” Video footage shows that’s untrue. Police covering up for each other makes it harder to remove or charge them for misconduct.

Conduct a review to identify dishonest or misleading statements made by officers for case files or to the public about the conduct of their fellow officers (can be verified against video footage)

Fire or take disciplinary action against officers who have made those statements

Institute an ongoing review and disciplinary processes (leveraging an independent review body)

3. Charge police for past crimes

Derek Chauvin was never charged for past incidents of excessive force

Conduct a review of past cases where evidence exists of a police officer committing murder, manslaughter, and other crimes or standing by and enabling the crime to be committed

End qualified immunity and press un-watered down charges on past cases within the statute of limitations

Remove the conflict of interest for prosecutors when it comes to charging police officers (use independent prosecutors for all police cases)

—

The people that have the power to make these changes are elected officials. That means the people that have the power to make these changes are us.

Make your voice heard

Contact your police chiefs, district attorneys, and state legislators and make it clear what actions you demand to see

If it’s just those four police officers fired and charged, that is not enough. The police have a history of knowing who their bad apples are and doing little about it. They absolutely could have removed Derek Chauvin from the force and charged him for crimes before he murdered George Floyd. Do not let up until it’s clear that police and prosecutors are finally taking action against other Derek Chauvins.

Could it take generations to end deeply-entrenched racism in our country? It might. But that doesn’t mean we need to empower racism in the meantime. Racists who might be in the police force should not be allowed to keep their jobs or act above the law. We can and should end this right now."	left
grq7jq	hillaryclinton	N.J. judge who asked rape victim about closing her legs is removed from the bench	"The New Jersey judge who was previously suspended for asking an alleged rape victim if she could have closed her legs during the attack will never serve as a judge in the state again.

The state Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision Tuesday removing John Russo Jr. from judicial office and permanently barring the former Ocean County Superior Court judge from presiding over a New Jersey courtroom again because of “repeated and serious acts of misconduct” committed by Russo, wrote Chief Justice Stuart J. Rabner, who authored the opinion on behalf of the high court.

The decision was expected after a three-judge panel recommended in January to remove Russo from the bench for violating the Code of Judicial Conduct on at least four occasions — most prominently when he asked an alleged rape victim a series of questions that the the state’s Advisory Committee on Judicial Conduct (ACJC) described as “wholly unwarranted, discourteous and inappropriate.”

Russo began questioning a woman about her efforts to stop the alleged assault as she appeared in court in Ocean County in 2016 seeking a restraining order against the man who allegedly raped her.

""Do you know how to stop somebody from having intercourse with you?” he asked her, according to a transcript.

After the woman said “run away or try to get away,” Russo asked if there was anything else she could have done.

“Block your body parts?” Russo asked. “Close your legs? Call the police? Did you do any of those things?”

Rabner, the state’s top judge, wrote in the opinion that it would be “inconceivable” that Russo could preside over domestic violence or sexual assault matters in the future after those comments.

“No reasonable victim could have confidence in a court system were he to preside over those kinds of cases again,” the chief justice wrote.

Russo, who previously served as mayor Toms River, apologized through his attorney for the remarks during a Supreme Court disciplinary hearing in July 2019. However, Russo claims, according to the opinion, that he was trying to help a “demoralized” witness on cross-examination and “get her re-engaged in the hearing,” but the court wrote that “that explanation does not square with the record.”

“No witness, alleged victim, or litigant should be treated that way in a court of law,” Rabner wrote. ... “Judges set the tone for a courtroom. Especially when it comes to sensitive matters like domestic violence and sexual assault, that tone must be dignified, solemn, and respectful, not demeaning or sophomoric. (Russo) failed in that regard.”

An attorney representing Russo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The opinion outlines three other instances in which Russo’s actions as a judge showed a “pattern of misconduct and unethical behavior.”

In 2016, Russo threatened a mother in a paternity case with financial penalties when she wouldn’t disclose her address. Russo then remarked: “He’s going to find you, ma’am. We’re all going to find you.”

“(Russo’s) disturbing comments and questions were insensitive, threatening, and discourteous, and they reflected poorly on his temperament,” Rabner wrote in the court’s opinion.

In a guardianship case involving his ex-wife and their son, Russo asked a high-level court employee who worked in the same courthouse as him to help him reschedule the case in another county. The opinion said Russo “should have worked through his attorney to request that his personal matter be rescheduled.”

The final misconduct charge against Russo was for decreasing the amount a man had to pay in back child support. The judge said in court he went to high school with the man and then subsequently decreased the amount owed from $10,000 to $300 “based solely on uncorroborated financial information supplied by the defendant,” according to the opinion.

Rabner wrote that the incident, raised “doubts about Russo’s impartiality.”

The state Supreme Court wrote in their decision to remove Russo from office and bar him from future judicial positions that the four incidents “viewed together” have “lasting consequences.”

“His pattern of misconduct and unethical behavior not only undermined the integrity of different court proceedings but also impaired his integrity and the Judiciary’s,” Rabner wrote. “His overall behavior reflects a lack of probity and fitness to serve as a judge. And his conduct breached the public’s trust.”

hnos79	hillaryclinton	Trump Pushed CIA to Give Intelligence to Kremlin, While Taking No Action Against Russia Arming Taliban	"Why would the Russian government think it could get away with paying bounties to the Taliban to kill American soldiers? One answer to that question may be the extraordinary response that Moscow received when the Trump administration learned of a precursor to the bounty operation. From mid-2017 and into 2018, Pentagon officials became increasingly confident in intelligence reports that the Kremlin was arming the Taliban, which posed a significant threat to American and coalition forces on the ground in Afghanistan.

President Trump’s actions in the face of the Russia-Taliban arms program likely signaled weak US resolve in the eyes of Putin and Russian military intelligence.

Three dimensions of Trump’s response are described in detail in this article, based on interviews with several former Trump administration officials who spoke to Just Security on the record.

First, President Trump decided not to confront Putin about supplying arms to the terrorist group. Second, during the very times in which U.S. military officials publicly raised concerns about the program’s threat to U.S. forces, Trump undercut them. He embraced Putin, overtly and repeatedly, including at the historic summit in Helsinki. Third, behind the scenes, Trump directed the CIA to share intelligence information on counterterrorism with the Kremlin despite no discernible reward, former intelligence officials who served in the Trump administration told Just Security.

Most of these officials emphasized, as a caution, the significant qualitative difference between arming the Taliban and paying bounties to kill American service members—a massive escalation. Unlike bounties, the Russian-Taliban arms program could also be potentially explained, or plausibly denied, by Moscow as an effort to assist the Taliban’s fight against the common enemy of ISIS. That said, the arms also reportedly became increasingly sophisticated in what appears to provide the Taliban an edge against NATO and Afghan government forces.

The failure to push back on the weapons program signaled to Putin that he could press further, said Michael Carpenter, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense with responsibility for Russia in the Obama administration. “When Western powers fail to push back, the Kremlin keeps prodding and probing — until it meets resistance, or until the costs for President Putin and his regime exceed the perceived benefits,” Carpenter wrote in Just Security on Friday.

What we now know is that President Trump not only failed to push back against Russia’s arming the terrorist group. That extraordinary act of omission was coupled with the president’s effort to push the CIA to cooperate with Russia by providing U.S. intelligence to the Kremlin on counterterrorism operations despite getting nothing in return, according to former officials.

A. Top Military Officials Sounds the Alarm

President Trump has denied being informed of U.S. intelligence reports on the Russian bounty operation, but the same can’t be so easily claimed about the Russian weapons to the Taliban. Over the course of 2017 and 2018, senior military officials began speaking openly, in media interviews and before Congress, about their increasing confidence in the intelligence picture of the Russian arms and the significant concerns it raised for U.S. and Coalition troops.

The following Timeline shows the series of public statements by senior military officials about the Kremlin’s provision of weapons to the Taliban.

Timeline

Feb. 9, 2017: Gen. John Nicholson, Commander, U.S. Forces Afghanistan and NATO’s Resolute Support Mission, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee made headlines by drawing attention to Russian efforts to support the Taliban; over the following months, senior military officials would specifically identify the problem of Russian provision of weapons to the Taliban Note on President Trump: On Feb. 16, 2017 President Trump says in a press conference , “by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia;” “If we could get along with Russia, that’s a positive thing. We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who is going to be meeting with them shortly. And I told him, I said, I know politically it’s probably not good for me;” “if we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing.” March 23, 2017: Gen. Curtis M. Scaparrotti, Commander, U.S. European Command and Supreme Allied Commander, Europe in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee raises the Russian arms issue March 29, 2017: Gen. Joseph L. Votel, Commander, U.S. Central Command in testimony before the House Armed Services Committee raises the Russian arms issue April 24, 2017: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Gen. John Nicholson, Commander, Resolute Support and U.S. Forces Afghanistan, in a press conference held in Afghanistan raise the Russian arms issue Note on President Trump: On May 10, 2017, Trump meets with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the Oval Office, where the President reportedly passes highly classified information to the two Russian officials Note on President Trump: On May 25, 2017, in Europe, Trump chastises NATO leaders for their “chronic underpayments” to the alliance and fails to reaffirm U.S. commitment to Article 5 of the Atlantic Charter for collective self-defense in a speech; the omission surprises Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and National Security Advisor McMaster, who endeavored to include language supporting Article 5 in Trump’s remarks prior to the summit, Politico reports Note on President Trump: On July 9, 2017: Upon returning from his first face-to-face meeting with Putin at the G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, Trump tweets , “Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia!” Note on President Trump: July 19, 2017: US officials announce that Trump has decided to end a program to arm Syrian rebels. An anonymous current official tells the Washington Post, “This is a momentous decision. … Putin won in Syria.” A former White House official tells the Post, “People began thinking about ending the program, but it was not something you’d do for free.” “To give [the program] away without getting anything in return would be foolish.” These statements are even more relevant in consideration of Russia’s arming of the Taliban at the time. Sept. 28, 2017: Sec. Mattis in a joint press conference with Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg raises the Russian arms issue Note on President Trump: On Jan. 29, 2018: The White House announces it will not impose new sanctions on Russia March 23, 2018: Gen. John Nicholson, Commander, Resolute Support and U.S. Forces Afghanistan in an interview with the BBC raises the Russian arms issue Note on President Trump: On July 5, 2018: President Trump says at a political rally, “I might even end up having a good relationship, but they’re going, ‘Will President Trump be prepared? You know, President Putin is KGB and this and that.’ You know what? Putin’s fine. He’s fine.” Note on President Trump: On July 16, 2018, in a very friendly summit between the two leaders at Helsinki, President Trump publicly sides with President Putin over the U.S. intelligence community on the Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections

On Sept. 1, 2018, Gen. Nicholson told the Voice of America, “We know that Russia is attempting to undercut our military gains and years of military progress in Afghanistan, and make partners question Afghanistan’s stability.” A few days later, he steps down, as scheduled, after serving in the position for over two years. Mattis resigns that December over sharp policy differences with the president.

B. President Trump’s Noticeable Silence

Absent from those public statements by top military officials were similar public statements or public protestations by President Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, or Mattis’s successors. “Nicholson’s 2018 interview was a rare public protest by a U.S. official. Trump didn’t press the Russians to stop, and so they continued,” wrote the Washington Post’s David Ignatius last week.

Peter Bergen observed a similar discrepancy between Nicholson’s BBC interview and President Trump’s disposition toward Putin, in Bergen’s 2019 book, Trump and His Generals: The Cost of Chaos.

If anything, there was reason for administration officials to intensify their public opposition to Russian military support for the Taliban, not quiet themselves. That’s in part because the Kremlin’s support became more sophisticated and a greater threat to U.S., NATO, and Afghan forces, Carpenter told me. In an email, he said:

The type of equipment the Russians transferred to the Taliban also shows how the Kremlin was becoming increasingly confrontational over time. At first, the Russians were mostly providing excess AK-47s, weapons that are found in almost every major global conflict. More recently, however, they also started transferring night-vision equipment, which is both in shorter supply in Russia but also specifically intended to equalize the gap between NATO forces and the Taliban. Throughout the conflict in Afghanistan, U.S. special forces have always “owned the night.” The Russians wanted to change that to the detriment of the U.S. and its NATO allies.

At a press conference this past Wednesday, July 1, Pompeo suggested that he repeatedly confronted his Russian counterparts about the arms program, even though the reporter had not asked about that program. The reporter posed a question about the bounties:

On this bounty issue, you had some conversations with senior Russian officials after your aides were told about evidence of the Russian bounties. Did you use those opportunities to tell Moscow not to endanger U.S. troops in that manner?

In his response, Pompeo raised the arms program:

We took this seriously; we handle it appropriately. The Russians have been selling small arms that have put Americans at risk there for 10 years. We have objected to it. To your point, when I meet with my Russian counterparts, I talk with them about this each time: “Stop this.” … So yes, maybe not every time, but with great frequency, when I speak to my Russian counterparts we talk about Afghanistan. We talk about the fact that we don’t want them engaged in this.

In his reply, Pompeo had made one of the strongest statements to date of the administration’s confidence in the intelligence assessment of the Russian-Taliban arms program and its threat to US forces. (See also Pompeo’s reiterating those claims later the same day in a Fox News interview.)

But Pompeo’s claim to have “handle[d] it appropriately” and to have raised the arms supplies with his Russian counterparts, presumably including Foreign Minister Lavrov, is dubious.

“To my knowledge, this was never raised with Putin by Trump or any other senior officials, nor am I aware of any specific high-level pushes for this to be raised with senior Russian officials,” a former senior Trump administration official told Just Security.

Nonetheless, it can’t be completely ruled out that Pompeo raised the issue, for example, in one-on-one meetings. But how much would that matter without President Trump’s taking action including in his public statements about Russia and engagements with Putin?

In speaking about both the Kremlin’s arms and bounty programs, Brett McGurk, who served as Special Presidential Envoy until December 2018, told me, “Both should have been flagged and raised in Trump’s frequent engagements with Putin. It’s even worse if Pompeo was raising the arming issue with Lavrov (as he claims) or Khalilzad with his counterpart, but Trump never raised the issue with Putin. That makes whatever Pompeo may have said irrelevant, as the Russians dismiss anything Americans officials say if not backed from the top.”

I asked Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, a former senior CIA official with expertise on Russia and counterterrorism, how the President’s inaction in this policy space would affect any similar efforts on the part of senior intelligence officials to raise concerns with their Russian counterparts. “Given Trump’s permissive relationship with Putin, and his generally skeptical attitude concerning US intelligence, Russian special services would feel more inclined to ignore any US demands for action if they doubted the president’s resolve to back up the US intelligence community,” Mowatt-Larssen told me.

C. Trump Pushes CIA to Share Intelligence with Russia

At the same time that senior US military officials were publicly expressing concerns that Russia was arming the Taliban’s terrorist activities that threatened U.S. personnel, President Trump was pushing the CIA to share counterterrorism intelligence information with the Kremlin.

In the first weeks of the administration, National Security Advisor Michael Flynn tried to push the Defense Department to engage in cooperation with Russia, but the Pentagon and Centcom opposed his efforts, the Daily Beast’s Spencer Ackerman reported. Flynn was not the first to consider such an idea. Secretary of State John Kerry floated the concept of cooperation with Russia against terrorist groups in Syria during the final year of the Obama administration, but was rebuffed by Defense Secretary Ash Carter and other parts of the administration. Like Kerry, Flynn ran into a roadblock: a provision of the National Defense Authorization Act strictly prohibits “bilateral military-to-military cooperation” between the United States and Russia, unless the Secretary of Defense issues a waiver and notifies Congress. Mattis reportedly refused to issue a waiver.

[For more on that statute, see former Department of Defense Acting General Counsel Robert S. Taylor’s analysis and my earlier coverage at Just Security in 2018.]

But there’s no analogous statute barring cooperation by the CIA.

That’s where the White House succeeded in pushing the CIA to cooperate with Russia despite analysts determining the Kremlin would provide nothing in return, two former CIA officials who served in the Trump administration told me.

“There was a consistent push for CT cooperation with Moscow, coming from the White House, despite near universal belief within the IC that this effort would be one sided and end up being a waste of time and energy,” said Marc Polymeropoulos, who retired in mid-2019 from the Senior Intelligence Service at the CIA.

“To be fair, every administration wants a reset with Moscow, and thus the IC dutifully attempted to engage with the Russian government on CT matters,” he added in discussing the Trump policy. “Bottom line, we tried, as this was the guidance from policy makers. There was no ‘deep state push back,’ there was no stalling, there was a concerted effort to work with the Russians.”

Douglas London, a CIA Senior Operations Officer who retired at the end of 2018, told me that “despite increasing reflections of Russian material support to the Taliban raised publicly by Defense Secretary James Mattis in 2017 and throughout 2018 by General John Nicholson, President Trump pressured CIA to invest time and resources increasing counterterrorist cooperation with Russia.”

Prior administrations had also considered counterterrorism cooperation with Russia but learned the lesson that it was a one-way street on “cooperation.” In testimony before the Congressional Helsinki Commission, Carpenter gave the example of attempted cooperation around the Sochi Olympics. “We discovered that our chief interlocutor was not a counterterrorism expert but rather a counter-intelligence official, bluntly demonstrating Moscow’s chief priority lay in collecting intelligence on foreigners rather than sharing information on terrorist threats,” the former deputy assistant secretary of defense said.

Polymeropoulos who was personally involved in making a trip to Moscow in late 2017 to advance the cooperation policy told me of a similar conclusion to the effort. “As we anticipated, however, it was a sisyphean task. We ended up only giving information, and not receiving anything worthwhile. I cannot think of anything of value that the Russians provided us, that saved any US lives, or was worth even the time it took to pick up the phone to set up the meetings.”

“It was always the same line from downtown, even when failure was so evident and so obvious–keep engaging on CT.” Polymeropoulos said. “This myth that Russians could be a good CT partner—that former National Security Advisor Flynn first perpetuated and then became the cornerstone of this farcical engagement strategy–was by 2019 met with near total derision and eye rolling in the IC.”

“The direction [from President Trump] came despite assessments that Russia was not being forthcoming,” London said. “Failing to reciprocate U.S. willingness and share information on what ostensibly represented threats from common adversaries such as al-Qa’ida and ISIS, Russian counterparts used counterterrorism engagements to further counterintelligence.”

Before entering the administration, Pompeo himself had expressed contempt for the idea of cooperating with the Russians on counterterrorism. Asked to comment on Secretary Kerry’s proposal in October 2016, then-Congressman Pompeo was nothing short of scathing, “For the United States to share intelligence in a way that they hope we can keep sources and methods secure is foolish. … a dumb idea … such an awful idea … I hope that the silliness of Secretary Kerry on this issue will never come to fruition. It would be bad … for America.”

Pompeo served as CIA Director during the program described by Polymeropoulos and London. He left the CIA for the State Department in late April 2018.

D. Protections of US Personnel on the Ground: Getting Priorities Straight

The heart of the criticism of President Trump’s handling of Russian bounty intelligence reports has been his lack of action toward Moscow to safeguard American troops threatened by Russia’s aggression. Trump’s lack of response to the Russian arms to the Taliban may have helped pave the way to the increasingly audacious acts by Putin against U.S. forces. Was it a case of the President Trump making tradeoffs in his relationship with Putin?

“The operators on the ground are always victims of this strategic chess game,” Polymeropoulos said.

Polymeropoulos advised putting it in the context of Pakistan’s support for the Taliban and the failure of administrations’ to push back adequately with Islamabad. “Pakistan is far more complicit, Russians did it but not to the level of the Pakistanis, until the bounty issue. The bounty issue takes this to another level perhaps putting Russia now in the category of Pakistan, as a state sponsor of terrorism, in my view.”

Bipartisan legislation in the Senate, co-sponsored by Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO) and Sen. Robert Menendez, (D-NJ) and passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in December, would place pressure on the State Department to designate Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. Politico reported, in the wake of revelations about Russia’s bounty operation, that Gardner has renewed his push for the legislation with Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) voicing support in recent days.

I also communicated with Ambassador Todd Buchwald who retired from the State Department in July 2017, after serving across five Republican and Democratic administrations. As the Special Coordinator for the Department’s Office of Global Criminal Justice since 2015, one of Buchwald’s areas of expertise is the International Criminal Court’s investigation of US forces in Afghanistan.

Buchwald compared President Trump’s response to the Russian arms and bounty programs to the administration’s most recent actions toward the ICC. He provided a comment by email:

This episode just underscores how hard it is to figure out how the Administration decides what are and what are not our urgent national priorities – the situations in which it is appropriate for the President to invoke the extraordinary authorities that Congress long ago entrusted to Presidents upon a “declaration of national emergency.” Look at the administration’s reactions to two threats: the potential for an ICC case alleging U.S. detainee abuse in Afghanistan, and Russian support for the actual slaughter of U.S. service members there. Just three weeks ago, the President asserted his “steadfast commitment to protecting American service members and defending our national sovereignty” as his basis for his Executive Order imposing sanctions against the International Criminal Court. There are lots of different views about the Court but in fact it has never — in its history – actually convicted, or even prosecuted, the acts of a service member of the standing military of any state, much less a state as strong — and as committed to the rule of law — as the United States. Meanwhile, the Russians have — since the early days of the Administration (see here and here) — been smuggling secret weapons to our battlefield adversaries, intent on conducting actual deadly attacks on those service members; and then, following the President’s lack of objection, appear to have breathtakingly upped the ante by offering bounties for killing American troops. It is fair to ask: which of the two – the ICC or the Russians – actually imperils our troops in Afghanistan?; and which — in the words of the President’s Executive Order — actually constitutes “an unusual and extraordinary threat” to U.S. national security?

On Thursday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee will hold a hearing titled, “Russian Bounties on U.S. Troops: Why Hasn’t the Administration Responded?” The witnesses include Gen. Nicholson and former Acting CIA Director Mike Morrell.

im3jbb	hillaryclinton	Let’s Make Women’s Power Culturally Acceptable	"Let’s Make Women’s Power Culturally Acceptable

Twenty-five years ago this month, delegates from 189 countries descended on Beijing to participate in the United Nations’ Fourth World Conference on Women. This meeting was notable for many reasons, not least because it was, at the time, the largest gathering of women’s rights advocates in history: In addition to official government delegations, some 30,000 activists from around the world attended the conference. The rallying cry that emanated from Beijing, “Women’s rights are human rights”—famously proclaimed in a speech by the United States’ then-first lady, Hillary Clinton—still reverberates today.

At the conclusion of the summit, years of activism culminated in a historic inflection point, as governments meeting in Beijing agreed to the most ambitious Platform for Action on women’s rights in history, one that called for the “full and equal participation of women in political, civil, economic, social and cultural life.” Perhaps less well known, but just as important, was the formation of a network of civil society activists relegated to run-down buildings in Huairou, a muddy, far-off suburb of Beijing, by a Chinese government fearful of their power—who shared plans to implement the platform and address the issues that women faced around the globe. From gender-based violence to restrictions on access to health care, and from unequal responsibility for caregiving and household labor to laws preventing ownership of property, access to credit, and fair pay, women found common cause in a universal set of struggles. They left Beijing buoyed by the global recognition that violations of women’s rights and dignity—practices once seen as cultural—contravened fundamental human rights.

In the two and a half decades since, women’s rights activists have used the Beijing Platform as a springboard from which to press for legal and political change. In some respects—most notably in the areas of legal rights, health, and education—they have succeeded. In 1995, only 13 countries around the world had laws criminalizing domestic violence; today, more than 150 nations do, and 85 percent have provisions enshrining the promise of gender equality in their constitutions. The scourge of maternal mortality, which previously stood at half a million women per year, has dropped by almost 50 percent. And the gender gap in access to primary schooling has virtually closed on a global level, meaning that an entire generation of girls now has the chance for an education that was too often denied to their mothers or grandmothers.

Women’s rights activists have used the Beijing Platform as a springboard from which to press for legal and political change.

But in other areas—including the economy, politics, and security sector—women have made far less progress and in some cases even regressed. Despite the gains in girls’ education, women’s participation in the labor force actually dropped during the post-Beijing era, from 51 to 47 percent globally, even before the onset of COVID-19 decimated jobs disproportionately held by women. Although the proportion of women in political power has risen slightly—from 10 female heads of state or government in 1995 to 21 today—women remain dramatically underrepresented in politics in almost all 193 U.N. member states across the globe. Two decades after the U.N. Security Council recognized the importance of women’s contributions to security processes, only two women have ever served as chief negotiators of a peace agreement. And women’s power to control their bodies and lives continues to be undermined by pervasive sexual harassment, gender-based violence, and restrictions on access to reproductive health care.

The coronavirus pandemic and the economic crisis that followed have added to these challenges. Because women are more likely to be employed in the hardest-hit industries, such as retail and hospitality, their already tenuous place in the global economy has worsened. Even those who are employed remain saddled with a double burden of caregiving and household work—a responsibility that disproportionately falls on women everywhere in the world. As stress levels rise amid the pandemic, so has the incidence of intimate partner violence, jeopardizing the safety of women confined to their homes.

Meanwhile, in this moment of upheaval that has further threatened progress toward gender equality, the global women’s movement is growing rapidly. While the Beijing conference welcomed women by the tens of thousands, today technology has permitted women to join forces by the tens of millions and to organize with remarkable speed. And while the Beijing summit was five years in the making, the Women’s March of 2017—the largest global women’s protest in history—was organized online on every continent in only six weeks. In the fall of 2017, the #MeToo movement exploded, ultimately reaching more than 100 countries. And this year, COVID-19 and racial unrest have sparked new uprisings, from moms protesting in Portland to women marching in Minsk, adding to the tinder that has burned over the past several years. This digital activism has also fed political organizing: Women around the globe are running for office in historic numbers and campaigning for gender and racial equality.

If the 25 years since Beijing have been about women naming their rights, the next 25 must be about amassing sufficient power to claim them.

The need for this new wave of women’s activism demonstrates that many of the important rights won since Beijing—to prosecute abusers and harassers, fight discrimination, and compete in the economy—are too often unenforceable. And while there are still many places where gender inequalities remain enshrined in law, frequently even women who have won rights on paper are unable to apply them in practice, in part because of deeply embedded cultural norms. It is no accident that the areas where women have made the least progress—including the economic, political, and security sectors—have been historically male dominated. Twenty-five years after the world first recognized women’s rights as human rights, staggering numbers of people remain deeply uncomfortable with women wielding power in areas traditionally reserved for men: About half of the people surveyed across 75 countries believe that men make better political leaders than women, notwithstanding clear evidence that women’s inclusion in public life makes democracies stronger, more representative, and equitable. More than 40 percent of those surveyed also believe that men make better business executives, disregarding research confirming that women’s participation on corporate boards and in the C-suite improves the bottom line.

Certainly, legal barriers remain, and more political will and resources are needed to pass, implement, and enforce laws. Yet even where laws no longer limit women’s ability to compete for political office or in the economy, local and cultural norms hold women back, contributing to their dramatic underrepresentation in politics and corporate leadership and their overrepresentation in low-wage work. And cultural limits on women’s personal autonomy—to resist sexual harassment, make reproductive choices, and share caregiving burdens—create barriers to equal opportunity at work and at home. If the 25 years since Beijing have been about women naming their rights, the next 25 must be about amassing sufficient power to claim them.

Changing these underlying dynamics will require a cultural shift. Societies need to shift the expectations and attitudes that undergird the resistance to women’s power. Though persistent, norms are mutable: Consider domestic violence, which was largely viewed as cultural or a private family matter a generation ago and today is recognized globally as a crime. This breakthrough was achieved through not only advocacy for laws, policies, and treaties but also a revolution in attitudes.

To effect cultural change, we need to name and reframe the norms that still hold women back from reaching power and influence—which are outdated at best and debilitating at worst. There are many, but three in particular sap women’s power. First, stereotypes about the motives, authenticity, or so-called likability of women seeking power have hampered those running for elected office or rising in the private sector. Second, preconceived ideas that peg women as caregivers and men as breadwinners have fueled the undervaluation of care work and limited women’s labor force participation, with dramatic consequences for their own financial security and for global economic growth. Third, tolerance of sexual harassment has been a cause and a result of a power imbalance, which in turn has left women in the workplace—particularly low-paid women and women of color—unprotected and underpaid, undermining their collective potential.

To effect cultural change, we need to name and reframe the norms that still hold women back from reaching power and influence.

The global women’s movement that has been flexing its muscles in recent years needs resources, a clear and coordinated message, and a concerted strategy—an air game enlisting cultural influencers as well as a ground game engaging grassroots communities to push back on outdated norms and divisions of labor. Campaigns to make women’s power culturally acceptable will help ensure that women have the leverage to claim their rights not just in theory but also in practice—and demonstrate that power may come in the form of a woman wearing a mask, rather than a man behind a desk or wielding an army. This recognition, in part, will help us finally realize the promise of the Beijing Platform—and unleash the full potential of both our daughters and our sons."	left
lxned9	hillaryclinton	Hillary Clinton 'Loved' Dolly Parton's Cutout Vaccination Shirt: 'Shall We Make This a Trend?'	"On Tuesday, the country legend shared a video of herself getting Moderna's COVID vaccine (that she helped fund!) while wearing a sparkly blue cold shoulder blouse perfect for the shot administration

It's Dolly Parton's world, and we're just living in it.

The country music icon, 75, nearly broke the Internet on Wednesday when she posted an Instagram video of herself getting Moderna's COVID vaccine — that she helped fund — in a sparkly blue cold shoulder blouse perfect for the shot administration.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

Parton received love and support from thousands of fans and famous friends on social media...and even got the attention of former first lady Hillary Clinton!

""Loved seeing @dollyparton bring back the cold shoulder as a vaccination look. Shall we make this a trend?"" the politician wrote alongside a black-and-white throwback of herself sporting the same cut-out style.

The exposed shoulder look originated in the 1950s and '60s thanks in large part to Brigitte Bardot, who often donned off-the-shoulder tops and dresses. In fact, according to Bustle, the trend was originally dubbed The Bardot but became known as the Cold Shoulder when it evolved into a look that featured cut-outs rather than off-the-shoulder designs.

The look made a comeback in 2016 but has been relatively obsolete ever since. Will 2021 be the year of its second, vaccine-inspired resurgence? If anyone can make it happen, it's Dolly!

On Tuesday, the country queen shared a video of herself getting the Moderna vaccine, encouraging others to do the same.

""I'm finally going to get my vaccine. I'm so excited. I've been waiting a while I'm old enough to get it. And I'm smart enough to get it,"" she said in the video. ""So I'm very happy that I'm going to get my Moderna shot today. And I want to tell everybody that you should get out there and do it too, having changed where my songs to fit the occasion.""

The star then sang along to a modified version of her classic hit ""Jolene.""

Before masking up and meeting with the doctor who administered the shot, she further encouraged the ""cowards"" who don't trust the vaccine to get their shot.

""I'm trying to be funny now, but I'm dead serious about the vaccine,"" Parton said. ""I think we all want to give back to normal, whatever that is. And that would be a great shot in the arm, wouldn't it if we could get back to that? But anyhow, I just wanted to encourage everybody 'cause the sooner we get to feeling better, the sooner we are going to get back to being normal.""

""I just want to say to all of you cowards out there: Don't be such a chicken squat. Get out there and get your shot!"" she ended."	left
gnp93w	hillaryclinton	Hillary rakes in millions for Biden — but he's still far behind Trump	"But Biden’s campaign, which once had trouble raising money, has begun raking in serious money lately. He almost matched Trump’s fundraising last month, even as the candidate remains sequestered at home during the coronavirus pandemic and his campaign holds virtual fundraisers.

Biden and the Democratic National Committee jointly raised $60.5 million, nearly closing the monthly fundraising gap with Trump and the Republican National Committee, which raised $61.7 million. The majority of the Democratic presidential operation's fundraising flowed through the campaign, which raised $43.7 million.

Trump's sprawling fundraising machine saw a sizable amount of its money flowing though joint fundraising committees, which aren't required to file monthly.

But Trump and his operation, which include affiliated joint fundraising committees, has significantly more money stored away in bank accounts.

The Trump operation said it had over $255 million in cash on hand at the end of last month, and new filings with the Federal Election on Monday reveals that Biden has much less.

Between Biden and the DNC, Democrats have $97.5 million in the bank. Biden’s reelection campaign may have a bit more money squirreled away in a recently created joint fundraising committee, but a spokesperson for the DNC declined to provide details on the joint fundraising operation’s finances.

Virtual events pull in less money compared to traditional in-person ones. But Clinton’s event and another the night before aimed at Jewish donors, which raised $1.5 million, has encouraged the Biden campaign.

“It’s a different world. But we’re learning and we’re getting it done,” said Michael Adler, a Miami-based Biden adviser and donor who has known the candidate since 1972 and hosted the Jewish community fundraiser that featured the former U.S. ambassador to Israel, Dan Shapiro.

Said a donor who bundled thousands of dollars of checks from the Clinton fundraiser: “Biden’s getting the hang of this. And Hillary showed she still has a lot of firepower.”

Clinton appeared with DNC Chairman Tom Perez, who warned donors in attendance that Republicans will try to suppress votes, cheat and solicit foreign interference in the election. Clinton was also critical of Trump but acted more the part of stateswoman as she opined about Biden’s position as the Democratic standard bearer, which she was in four years ago.

In one question from a donor about Biden’s future running mate, Clinton explained the candidate would have to be ready to be president on Day One and needs to have a friendship with Biden. But there’s another factor, Clinton said, after considering those questions.

“Then you have to say: Can this person help me win? And what it really comes down to is: Can this person help me win in the Electoral College?” said Clinton, who won the popular vote in 2016 only to lose the Electoral College to Trump.

While Clinton’s fundraiser for Biden was big, Democratic party officials say they expect to raise even more with former President Barack Obama, perhaps in the summer. Obama, who endorsed Biden last month after his former vice president became the presumptive nominee, has already helped his former running mate raise money after his endorsement.

But the former president’s star power in the Democratic Party can pull in far more, a top Democratic official said.

“Obama is the kind of person who can make any Democrat give twice,” the official said.

insi4j	hillaryclinton	'The Princess Bride' cast is reuniting and Ted Cruz is livid about why	"New York (CNN Business) The cast of ""The Princess Bride"" is reuniting to raise money for the Democratic Party of Wisconsin -- inconceivable to Texas Senator and Princess Bride superfan Ted Cruz.

Donors to the Wisconsin Democrats will receive invitations to a livestream on September 13 at 7 pm ET for a script read of William Goldman's 1987 cult classic. The star-studded cast, including Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, Carol Kane, Chris Sarandon, Mandy Patinkin, Wallace Shawn, Billy Crystal and director Rob Reiner have agreed to join the virtual table read. A cast Q&A will be moderated by Patton Oswalt after the performance.

""Anything you donate will be used to ensure that Trump loses Wisconsin, and thereby the White House,"" the donation page says.

The event sent Cruz's torture machine to 50. In a tweet Saturday, Cruz called The Princess Bride ""perfect"" and said he wishes it would stay out of ""Hollywood politics.""

Elwes, who played the movie's hero, Westley, responded that Cruz should ""leave the fire swamp.""

hgg34k	hillaryclinton	The Puppet Dances for His Master — Russia Secretly Offered Afghan Militants Bounties to Kill U.S. Troops — Trump Has Known About This Since March Yet Has Done NOTHING (Except Invite Russia Back into the G7)	"WASHINGTON — American intelligence officials have concluded that a Russian military intelligence unit secretly offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants for killing coalition forces in Afghanistan — including targeting American troops — amid the peace talks to end the long-running war there, according to officials briefed on the matter.

The United States concluded months ago that the Russian unit, which has been linked to assassination attempts and other covert operations in Europe intended to destabilize the West or take revenge on turncoats, had covertly offered rewards for successful attacks last year.

Islamist militants, or armed criminal elements closely associated with them, are believed to have collected some bounty money, the officials said. Twenty Americans were killed in combat in Afghanistan in 2019, but it was not clear which killings were under suspicion.

The intelligence finding was briefed to President Trump, and the White House’s National Security Council discussed the problem at an interagency meeting in late March, the officials said. Officials developed a menu of potential options — starting with making a diplomatic complaint to Moscow and a demand that it stop, along with an escalating series of sanctions and other possible responses, but the White House has yet to authorize any step, the officials said."	left

President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris delivered speeches Saturday from Wilmington, Delaware, after winning the presidency, CNN projects.

If you're just reading in, here's what you need to know:

Biden makes an appeal for unity: He said he was humbled by the trust America had placed in him and reached out to those Americans who did not vote for him. ""I understand the disappointment tonight. I've lost a couple of times myself. But now, let's give each other a chance,"" he said, adding later in his remarks, ""This is the time to heal in America.""

Biden paid homage to his deep faith: Citing Biblical verses and a popular hymn, Biden said, “And he will raise you up on eagle's wings, bear you on the breath of dawn, and make you just sigh like the sun and hold you in the palm of his hand. Now, together on eagle's wings we embark on the work that God and history have called upon us to do with full hearts and steady hands. With faith in America and each other. With love of country, a thirst for justice. Let us be the nation that we know we can be. A nation united. A nation strengthened. A nation healed. The United States of America, ladies and gentlemen. There's never, never been anything we've tried we've not been able to do.""

Harris noted the significance of her place on the stage: Harris, a senator from California, who will make history as the first woman, the first Black person and the first person of South Asian descent to become vice president, said, ""While I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last, because every little girl watching tonight sees that this is a country of possibilities."" Harris also thanked Black women, saying they are ""too often overlooked, but so often prove that they are the backbone of our democracy.""

She spoke about her mother and made a nod to suffragettes: She remembered her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, who immigrated to the United States from India as a young woman. ""When she came here when was 19, she could not have imagined this moment,"" Harris said. The Vice President-elect also wore a white suit, a nod to suffragettes 100 years after women's constitutional right to vote was guaranteed.

gzzko4	hillaryclinton	'Hillary' Director Nanette Burstein Challenges Audiences to Rethink Hillary Rodham Clinton	"Hillary Director and Executive Producer Nanette Burstein speaks with Awards Daily’s Jalal Haddad about her documentary of one of the most well-known and polarizing figures in American politics.

Director and documentarian Nanette Burstein was challenged with the seemingly impossible task of tearing open the fresh wound of the 2016 election to revisit one of the most contentious periods of modern America, a period we are still living through and processing. How does someone take a story so fresh in all our minds and tell in a fresh, emotionally rewarding way?

Approaching Hillary, she first expanded the scope of the story and paired the election with over fifty years of Hillary Clinton’s life as a student, a young person in love, a lawyer, a wife, a First Lady, and as a Senator. She also widened the narrative to be about the women’s movement: how Hillary was affected by it and how she, in turn, affected it. Burstein was the first filmmaker given access to hundreds of hours of campaign footage, and most importantly, she was able to sit down with Hillary Clinton herself uninterrupted for seven days.

Nanette Burstein spoke with Awards Daily on what that process was like crafting a story that the American public already thinks they know so well. She also talks about convincing audiences to reexamine what they think they already know about one of the most polarizing figures of our time. She offered what it was like to interview Clinton herself and convince her to open up in a way we have never seen before. We also discussed how her experience with the docuseries shaped how she herself views politics and elections, especially as we end a primary season that began with a record number of female candidates.

Awards Daily: I’m curious on how Hillary, the docuseries, came to fruition? When did you decide you wanted to take a deeper look into Hillary Clinton’s life and why is now the right time to do that?

Nanette Burstein: The project came to fruition because, during the election, Hillary’s campaign filmed a lot of behind the scenes footage and afterwards one of the women who filmed all of it wanted the footage to be used in a documentary after the election. Hulu expressed interest, and that’s how I was brought in. I wanted to widen the story to make it about her life and incorporate thematically the women’s movement and her history in politics. Given that she is one of the most polarizing women in history, at least in modern history, I wanted to unpack that.

As far as timing, now more than ever we are a very polarized country. Converging all of those elements, there was an opportunity to understand her in a larger context.

AD: The film chronologically goes through fifty years of her life while constantly weaving in the footage from the 2016 election. How did you and your team decide on how you wanted to structure the story? Did that structure evolve throughout the filmmaking process?

NB: It did evolve dramatically. Early on when I was going through the hundreds of hours of footage, I came up with the idea of telling her whole life story. From the get go, I wanted the documentary to tell us who she was as a person because one of the accusations we’ve seen thrown at her so many times is that she is so guarded and that we have never gotten to know her.

One theme that kept popping up was that the past and present are always telling about each other. So I came up with a treatment and structure to merge the past and present. Within these two timelines we merged, it was also important that we told them chronologically.

AD: Good or bad, Hillary Clinton is someone that just about everyone in this country has a strong opinion on. From a storytelling standpoint how do you keep this story fresh when everyone already thinks they know everything?

NB: Well, first, I think it helps that no one had seen that footage. Second, the biggest complaint about Hillary Clinton is that some people feel like they don’t know who she is. They may have heard her story, but they’ve never been able to access her sitting down like this and talking about her instincts and her opinions. That keeps it fresh.

AD: As you were going through all of the archival footage was there anything that particularly surprised you?

NB: There were a lot of things. I knew a lot about her, but it was basically the Cliff’s notes version of her story. I didn’t realize how entwined she was with the women’s movement and how it affected her at the same time that she affected it. Then there were all of the smaller things and individual decisions that impacted her life like having to change her wardrobe, the sacrifices she made in Arkansas, and the intricacies of that love story. It made me think a lot about her life and those choices and how things would have gone differently.

Interviewing her and hearing her opinion on things was a really interesting experience. Until I spoke with her, I didn’t realize just how contentious of a battle she had over healthcare when she was the First Lady. Hearing that story made me realize just how dramatic it was. She was also very candid with me on what she felt some of her mistakes were throughout her career. I asked her what she thought her biggest one was and that answer surprised me. She said that she should have never been on the healthcare task force because it created too much noise. That was interesting to me because that was a moment in her life that is career-defining. A lot of people can’t be that introspective and honest.

AD: Was there any topic that you had a hard time getting her to open up about?

NB: I think she had a hard time talking about her marriage, particularly the infidelity. She knew I was going to ask about it, and she agreed to talk about it but she kept brushing it off to another day. It’s a hard experience to go through. She has written about it before, but it’s an entirely different thing to talk about it on camera. It’s so personal and she is such a private person.

AD: How many days total did you spend with her for the interview?

NB: Seven days total, about three or four hours a day.

AD: You also were also able to sit down with a lot of big and influential names from throughout Hillary’s life. There was only person that you didn’t sit down with even though she had a large presence throughout the footage, Hillary’s longtime staffer and friend Huma Abedin. Was she someone that you tried to speak with that was not interested in sitting down or was it a conscious decision?

NB: No, I did seek her out. She and I are actually still in touch, and she actually became a good friend. She is still Hillary’s right-hand person, but she has gone through her own trauma in front of the camera that we all witnessed. She didn’t want to live through that again.

AD: Story-wise, was there any topic that you found the most challenging in terms of storytelling or finding the right angle to approach?

NB: What was really challenging were the first couple years of the White House and her time as the First Lady. There were so many things that happened, so many scandals. It was complicated. There were a lot of discussions trying to figure out what to include and how much to include while being forthright. That took the most amount of time to craft.

AD: Is there a specific moment that you hear about the most from audiences?

NB: People will often come up to me with specific quotes like “She was never of her time…” and things like that. What I found the most interesting were the details that shocked people when they came up and spoke with me. A lot of people brought up the fact that there wasn’t a women’s restroom on the senate floor until the 90s. It wasn’t that long ago, and we didn’t have that many female representatives in our government. It’s shocking.

People were also surprised by how accessible she is in the documentary, how forthcoming she is. People were surprised by how open she is about her marriage both the love story and the scandal as. It shocked people how open Bill himself was in the documentary, how candid he was about his flaws. People also opened up to me about how painful it was to re-live election night and all of the emotions they went through.

AD: Did you find a lot of people were almost afraid to start the docuseries out of fears of reliving through that trauma again?

NB: Yes, absolutely. That’s one of the reasons I wanted to open it up and make it more than just about the election. I thought there was a bigger story to tell and I also didn’t want to make it too hard for people. It’s painful, I mean it’s still too painful for me. I think those wounds are still fresh for half of the country.

AD: Speaking of our current election, now that you’ve gone through the process of studying Hillary Clinton’s life and campaigns, what kind of influence did it have on the way you watch our current election? We began this primary season with a record number of female candidates. Did you notice any patterns from before from either the way they were perceived by the American public or the way they were covered by the media?

NB: Having studied this entire process, it revealed a lot of things, and one thing that stood out especially while watching now is the constant never-ending media analysis. Watching that unfold throughout this election was very telling about ourselves, especially about our own subconscious bias.

You can also see how things are changing. We began the primary with a record number of women running for the nomination, and as time moved ahead, it was down to two men. We also have Joe Biden promising to pick a female Vice President, and that in itself is something we’ve never seen. We’ve only ever had two female VP candidates before, neither of which made it to the White House.

When Elizabeth Warren dropped out, she was asked if gender was a factor in this election. She said, ‘That’s a trap question for every woman. If I said it was, they would say that I’m whining and if I said there wasn’t I’d be lying.’ Women candidates are expected to answer these questions all of the time, and they should not be the ones having to answer that. Hillary had to deal with that a lot. Until we actually have a woman in the White House, any woman running for office is going to be asked these questions. Once we get women in these positions of power, it will alter their way of thinking.

Until then it is a hurdle we have to overcome.

k6tmjk	hillaryclinton	MILLER CENTER ANNOUNCES HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON ORAL HISTORY PROJECT In-depth scholarly interviews will preserve the history of her service to the nation	"The Miller Center, home to the nation’s longest-running nonpartisan presidential oral history program, announced today that it has begun work on its next major initiative: The Hillary Rodham Clinton Oral History Project.

Clinton ranks among the most accomplished women in American history. No other woman has served as secretary of state, a United States senator, and First Lady of the United States. Moreover, she is the first woman to have secured the presidential nomination of a major party. Despite these accomplishments, there has been little scholarship about her career.

The Hillary Rodham Clinton Oral History Project will address this gap.

The first phase of the project will address Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state. Clinton will sit for 20 interviews and offer candid, detailed reflections on her service as America’s chief diplomat. The project will also entail interviews with staff, fellow ministers of state, multilateral and NGO leaders, heads of state, and grassroots activists engaged in this work. More than 70 voices—supporters and critics, allies and rivals, diplomats and generals—will complement the interviews with Clinton.

“Secretary Clinton is one of the leading figures in American politics and diplomacy,” said University of Virginia President Jim Ryan. “I am very pleased that she chose the Miller Center to conduct her oral history and am confident that this work will inform and inspire for years to come.”

Miller Center Director and CEO William Antholis emphasized the importance of the project. “Capturing and preserving the thoughts and recollections of the most senior officials who worked with and for an historic figure such as Secretary Clinton allows scholars, students, and the general public to better understand the events of her time and their context,"" Antholis said.

The Hillary Rodham Clinton Oral History Project will be directed by two scholars renowned for their study of government and diplomacy: Barbara Perry, Gerald L. Baliles Professor and director of presidential studies at the Miller Center, and Allida Black, editor emeritus of the Eleanor Roosevelt Papers, who joins the Miller Center as a distinguished visiting scholar.

“I am honored to be a part of this unique project to capture the spoken narratives of Secretary of State Clinton and those who worked with her during her tenure in the Obama Cabinet,” said Perry. “As a political scientist, I look forward to learning how she applied ‘smart power’ to American foreign policy in a particularly challenging era for the United States and promoted policies to achieve security and peace for women and girls around the globe.”

“As secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton redefined diplomacy and development and made women and girls a pillar of U.S. foreign policy,” Black said. “We have designed a project that captures that work in all its complexity and candor and that will engage diplomats, policy makers, activists, students, and scholars for generations to come.”

For nearly a half century, the Miller Center has collected candid and confidential recollections from every White House from Gerald Ford to Barack Obama. These interviews of individuals and groups are conducted by Miller Center oral historians alongside leading experts in political science, history, law, business, and public policy. The Miller Center is an independent, nonpartisan research unit of the University of Virginia whose scholars are faculty of the University. Many of the other interviewers are drawn from the broader faculty at the University, which is regularly listed as one of the nation’s top public universities, with strengths in politics, history, public policy, law, and business.

The Miller Center’s oral history interviews are widely praised and cited for their scholarly rigor and independence. Each interview begins with extensive research on the public record of the interviewees and how they carried out their policy and governing responsibilities. Detailed briefing books—containing public records, domestic and international press reports, and excerpts of other relevant contemporaneous accounts—will be used to prepare for each interview. The combination of confidentiality for the interviewee, deep research, subject-matter scholarly expertise, and release of interview transcripts produces a unique historical record.

The Hillary Rodham Clinton Oral History Project will be funded by private donations. All gifts are tax-deductible charitable contributions.

Project co-directors

Barbara Perry is the Gerald L. Baliles Professor and director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center, where she co-directs the Presidential Oral History Program. She has authored or edited 16 books on presidents, first ladies, the Kennedy family, the Supreme Court, and civil rights and civil liberties. Perry has conducted 110 interviews for the George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama Oral History Projects; interviewed President Bill Clinton for his presidential project; and directed completion of the Edward Kennedy Oral History Project. She has served as a U.S. Supreme Court fellow and has worked for both Republican and Democratic members of the Senate.

Allida Black is a distinguished visiting scholar at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center. She has written or edited 11 books and more than two dozen articles on U.S. politics and policy, the evolution of human rights, and women in politics. As research professor of history and international affairs at The George Washington University, she founded and directed the Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project, a multi-award-winning documentary edition of Eleanor Roosevelt’s writings on politics, policy, and human rights. She has conceptualized and led oral history projects related to the creation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Eleanor Roosevelt’s international legacy and her role as First Lady, and is working with former Liberian President and Nobel Peace Laureate Ellen Johnson Sirleaf to conduct oral histories of her administration and legacy."	left

ivrqw8	hillaryclinton	Here are 3 ways McConnell’s drive to replace Ginsburg could be derailed	"Reacting to the announcement that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away on late Friday, Daily Beast columnist Michael Tomasky warned that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) was likely up late plotting ramming through her replacement while he still has control of the Senate and with few impediments.

Reflecting on how McConnell blocked hearings for Judge Merrick Garland after he was nominated to the court in President Barack Obama's last year in office, Tomasky said no one should expect McConnell will chart the same course when it comes to whomever Donald Trump nominates less than 50 days before the November 2020 election.

""It’s sick because, as we know, this same McConnell back in 2016 thought that February of an election year—February, not September!—was too late for a president to name a new justice in an election year. But that, of course, was when the president was a Democrat,"" the Daily Beast columnist wrote before adding, ""Place yourself in the White House private residence, or down in Louisville, at Chez Mitch, when the news about Ginsburg was conveyed Friday. Do you think either of them took even 30 seconds to reflect on her service to her nation?""

With that in mind, the longtime political observer noted there are three possible scenarios where quickly placing another conservative on the high court could be derailed.

At the top of the list would be Democrats serving notice to McConnell that, should he try and force the issue and get a vote in before the election, they will expand the number of justices on the court if they take control of the Senate and the White House after the election.

As Tomasky put it, ""Some Democratic senators who might have Mitch’s ear, say Joe Manchin, will go to him. And Mitch will say: F*ck off. However, the Democrats have a card to play here, if Joe Biden will play it. The number nine (of Supreme Court justices) is neither in the Constitution nor law. Biden, and Chuck Schumer, can say: If you fill this seat now, if Biden wins, we’re expanding the Court to 11 or 13, and your majority is dead. And they should be ready to do it.""

Secondly, the Senate Majority Leader may read the tea leaves when it comes to polling on the issue of a late Supreme Court replacement with the election in the offing and, if sentiment is overwhelmingly against it, may take a pass lest he damage the Republican Party even more than Donald Trump has already done. As the columnist put it: ""As I’ve often written, our democracy is corrupted and screwed, but it’s still enough of a democracy that public opinion actually matters.""

Lastly, McConnell who is desperately trying to hold onto power in the Senate may be able to save some GOP-held Senate seats that are poised to flip if he holds off.

""Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, not up for re-election, has apparently said she will not confirm a justice until the next president is sworn in,"" he wrote. ""That’s one. Democrats would need three more to say that they’ll follow Murkowski’s lead. Susan Collins, Cory Gardner, and Martha McSally seem the obvious choices. There are others. It all depends on the degree of progressive mobilizing in those states, to make those GOP senators know that if they acquiesce to McConnell’s games, they will lose.""

Offering a glimmer of hope, he added, ""So all is not lost yet. But gear up for a fight. And as you do, always leave time in your mind for this remarkable, towering American. Everything we do in this corrupt period should be to honor all that she stood for.""

gdyqe5	hillaryclinton	Opinion: Women are better leaders. The pandemic proves it.	"Michelle P. King is the director of Inclusion at Netflix and the author of The Fix: Overcome the Invisible Barriers That Are Holding Women Back at Work. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.

As the entire world works to contain the spread of the coronavirus, the role of effective leadership has been brought into razor sharp focus. What people need now are leaders with empathy, compassion and an ability to show support — skills that women leaders tend to exhibit more than men. While it may take a global pandemic to finally acknowledge the unique talents and capabilities women leaders offer, companies shouldn't wait until there is a crisis to afford women an opportunity to lead.

It's a trend we've seen before. The 2008 financial crash and resulting crisis was a result of irresponsible risk taking that ultimately came down to leadership and organizational priorities. Research examining risk-taking behavior finds that men are more prone to taking higher risks. Increased collective risk-taking behavior contributed to the crisis, which was an outcome of male-dominated workplaces that valued individual achievement and competition rather than collective well-being. Subsequent research found that women tend to adopt a more relational approach to leadership , which is more effective in a crisis compared to the more traditional command-and-control style of leadership typically adopted by men. Overall, women leaders adopt a relational style when leading through a crisis, which is highly effective as they focus on building trust, alleviating fears and managing the crisis at hand.

These lessons extend beyond crisis situations and into the everyday modern workplace. Research has consistently found women tend to adopt a more transformational leadership style , which includes demonstrating compassion, care, concern, respect and equality. In contrast, men have a more transactional approach, which includes a more task-focused, achievement-oriented and directive style of management.

But despite having demonstrated a more effective leadership style, women are put forward for fewer leadership positions and the roles they are given tend to be riskier. It's a phenomenon known as the ""glass cliff."" One of the key reasons for this is that risky roles are often considered a good fit for women, even though the chances of failure are higher. The underlying assumption is that women can manage difficult situations because they know how to assume the caretaker role and manage a lack of social support. In other words, women are used to not being set up for success and having to make the best of it. Because women have less access to leadership opportunities, these risky leadership roles are hard to turn down.

gdhf49	hillaryclinton	Don Lemon Mocks Trump's Obsession With Barack Obama	"CNN’s Don Lemon went after Donald Trump with an intense monologue Sunday night asking why he is obsessed with his predecessor, Barack Obama.

Lemon opened his show by ripping Trump for using the weekend to tweet about grievances with his political foes instead of staying focused on dealing with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

“He can’t seem to muster the kind of compassion that we need from our president.” Lemon lamented. He focused on how Trump retweeted an account to attack Obama for “running the Russia hoax.”

Right off the bat, its worth noting that the U.S. intelligence community, the GOP-led Senate Intelligence Community and Robert Mueller’s investigation all agree that Russia attempted to interfere in America’s 2016 election. Lemon called Trump’s retweet a “a new low from a president who goes low all the time,” a “disturbed fantasy,” and “a shameless attempt to distract from your own administration’s mishandling of a crisis that’s cost over 67,000 American lives.”

After comparing Trump’s remarks to Obama and George W. Bush calling for American solidarity over the weekend, Lemon stared directly into the camera and questioned Trump’s obsession with Obama.

What is it about President Obama that really gets under your skin? Is it because he’s smarter than you? Better educated? Made it on his own? Didn’t need daddy’s help? Wife is more accomplished? Better looking? I don’t know, what is it, what is it about him? That he’s a black man that’s accomplished being president? That he punked you on the whole birth certificate thing? What is it about him? Just wondering.

PLANNED PARENTHOOD VOTES

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Thursday, September 3, 2020

CONTACT: Planned Parenthood Votes Media Office; 212-261-4433; [email protected]

Planned Parenthood Votes Pressroom

Washington, DC — Today, Donald Trump promised leaders of the anti-abortion movement he would make attacking access to safe, legal abortion a second-term priority. In a letter, he pledges to continue appointing federal judges with records hostile to reproductive rights;pass legislation that would criminalize doctors; establish severe restrictions for abortion; and “fully defund” Planned Parenthood.

Jenny Lawson, Executive Director, Planned Parenthood Votes, issued the following statement:

“If it wasn’t clear before, it’s crystal clear now: A second Trump term would mean four more years of relentless, withering attacks on reproductive health care, including access to safe, legal abortion. Despite record-high support for abortion rights, Trump and his allies in Congress and state legislatures are committed to doing all they can to fill the courts with anti-abortion judges, pass restrictive abortion bans, and try to close Planned Parenthood health centers that provide essential sexual and reproductive health care to 2.4 million patients annually. It’s no exaggeration to say our health and rights are on the line this November, and Planned Parenthood Votes is prepared to ensure we elect reproductive health champions up and down the ballot.""

ikohtv	hillaryclinton	Women Need More Power	"I have long believed—supported by Everests of evidence—that relegating women’s health, education, and economic participation to the margins of foreign and domestic policy is ruinous not just for women, but for entire nations. The Beijing conference represented a rare opportunity to focus the world’s attention on the status of women and girls. I wanted to break the silence about atrocities being committed in specific regions of the world, as well as injustices and abuses that are universal, including in developed democracies such as my own. Most of all, I wanted to argue that it was no longer acceptable to talk about human rights and women’s rights as separate topics. They were one and the same, and I was determined to make people hear this.

Read: Hillary Rodham Clinton’s ‘Women’s Rights’ speech from 1995

Back in the U.S., the idea of my attendance in Beijing had been controversial. I was fresh off a bruising fight for health-care reform, a topic some considered far beyond the job description of a first lady. A year earlier, I had been burned in effigy at a protest against the health-care plan. (Today I take this as a compliment; back then it stung a little.) Members of Congress had scoffed at the idea of an international gathering focused on women’s issues. Republican Senator Phil Gramm declared that the conference was “shaping up as an unsanctioned festival of anti-family, anti-American sentiment.”

Officials at the State Department were nervous: A first lady talking about foreign policy on the world stage? What if I created some kind of international incident? They were also concerned that going to Beijing would implicitly condone China’s dismal human-rights record. I shared those concerns (and later, when I led the State Department, I made sure that China’s human-rights record was a focus of investigation and criticism). But in the end, I made my position clear: I was either going to travel to the conference as the leader of an official American delegation, or I was going to buy a seat on a commercial airline and attend as a private citizen. The opposition melted away.

Now, staring out at the delegates in front of me, I had a fleeting thought: What if this was a mistake? But if there’s anything I’ve learned in life, it is to keep going. I spoke about women and girls who were working to advance education, health care, economic independence, legal rights, and political participation. With barely concealed rage, I talked about the use of rape as a tactic of war, and the violence women are subjected to in their own homes.

I criticized China for its policy of coercive family planning. I didn’t know it at the time, but the Chinese government cut off the television feed of my speech to the rest of the convention center, where thousands of people who couldn’t fit into the hall were watching. (A few years ago, however, I got an email from a friend who had been walking around a department store in Beijing when the music faded and my speech started playing over the loudspeakers. I’ve always wondered what subversive person managed that.)"	left

id9x5k	hillaryclinton	Ezra Klein- The Tragedy of Hillary Clinton	"In another world — a world where the presidential candidate who wins the most votes wins the White House — Hillary Clinton is preparing once again to accept the Democratic Party’s nomination for president Thursday night. Historical counterfactuals are always dangerous, but I feel confident in this one: In that world, America had competent presidential leadership for the course of the coronavirus outbreak, its own Angela Merkel.

Clinton has her faults, but her strengths would have been on display here: a deep understanding of the federal government, a belief that it is the president’s job to solve national problems, an unparalleled enthusiasm for convening experts and synthesizing their knowledge into policy, an unusual enthusiasm for the details of interagency collaboration, a relentless focus on operational details.

President Clinton would be able to tell you where every vaccine in development stood, how fast tests were coming back in all 384 metropolitan areas, what PPE stocks looked like in every midsize city in the country. We would not be free of the coronavirus, but unlike under this administration, we would have a plan, and competent people running it, and we would’ve had it in place for months and months by now.

But that is not the world we live in. In this world, the unqualified reality TV star who won 3 million fewer votes captured the White House and botched the pandemic. And Clinton, wearing suffragist white, was relegated to a few scant minutes on the penultimate hour of the penultimate night of the convention.

In America, nothing washes sins clean like success, and nothing ensures ignominy like failure. In 2016, Clinton lost, and so her strengths have been forgotten, her weaknesses magnified. And yet her presence gave Wednesday’s convention a tragic air. The programming celebrated female leadership, with videos honoring past trailblazers, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi following Clinton, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren making the policy case for the Democratic ticket. As Kamala Harris accepted the vice presidential nomination, she honored the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote. “These women inspired us to pick up the torch and fight on,” Harris said.

But all those women joined together in service of the common goal of electing the 46th straight man to the presidency, after the country elected a buffoon over a hypercompetent woman in 2016 — a loss that convinced many Democrats that a white man would be the strongest candidate in 2020. And Joe Biden, for all his virtues, highlights the specific tragedy of Hillary Clinton in a way few other politicians could.

Like Clinton, Biden is a veteran politician, with a long record dotted with bad votes and taped gaffes. Clinton was often criticized for offering too many policies and too little boldness or thematic vision. Biden is also running on a laundry list of policies, but he’s far more detached from the substance of his agenda, and tends to speak in gauzy generalities. Clinton was criticized as too cautious a figure, too much a creature of the establishment, to win in a country that prefers inspiring outsiders. But Biden has been in politics longer, and tacked more carefully toward the Democratic Party’s shifting center over the course of his career.

Moreover, Biden lacks some of Clinton’s virtues: her policy sharpness, her attention to detail, her polymathic hunger for information, her obvious delight in the details of governance. The difference between them was on display in April when she endorsed him. There’s nothing wrong with Biden’s performance, but Clinton is by far the more knowledgeable and precise in her discussion of Covid-19.

In that way, Biden neutralizes some of the more high-minded critiques of Clinton. What he has that she didn’t is fuzzier: a reputation for likability, for relatability. Clinton was beloved by her staff, by those who met her or worked with her, but the person they described was rarely the person the public saw. Biden’s warmth shines through on the trail. There’s no “you’re likable enough” burns in his background.

Indeed, the whole convention is a paean to Biden’s likability, to the ease with which he connects, to the willingness people have to look past gaffes and bad votes to Biden’s fundamental decency. Republicans attested to his likability. Democrats related stories of how he cared about them, and cares about you. Jacquelyn Brittany, a 31-year-old security guard for the New York Times who met Biden a year ago and then nominated him on Tuesday night, explained her support to the Washington Post: “I just like Joe. I’ve always liked him.”

Clinton never managed that easy rapport with the public. She was endlessly caught in what feminist scholars call “the double bind.” As linguist Deborah Tannen wrote, “the requirements of a good leader and a good woman are mutually exclusive. A good leader must be tough, but a good woman must not be. A good woman must be self-deprecating, but a good leader must not be.” Reams of research reflect the difficulty women have stepping into leadership positions historically reserved for men, and Clinton faced those contradictions for decades on decades. When she chose her words carefully, it was considered calculating; when she emphasized her competence, she was dismissed as cold; when she tried to show her passion, she was told to stop shouting.

As Clinton used to tell her staff: “Nothing draws fire like a woman moving forward.” And sure enough, as Warren’s campaign caught fire in 2020, the critiques of her took on an eerie echo of the attacks levied at Clinton.

Biden is, of course, running in a different moment than Clinton. The fears about Trump came true. He’s been a disaster, and Americans mourn the deaths and collect the unemployment checks to prove it. If Clinton had sat out 2016 and run in 2020, perhaps she’d be trouncing Trump as we speak.

But Trump’s flaws were always clear. In her speech tonight, Clinton couldn’t hide her frustration that her warnings went unheeded. “For four years, people have said to me, ‘I didn’t realize how dangerous he was,’ ‘I wish I could go back and do it over,’ ‘I should have voted.’ This can’t be another woulda-coulda-shoulda election.”

More Americans voted for Clinton than voted for Trump, but it wasn’t enough. And as Biden’s rise — and historic lead — suggests, what held others back wasn’t just a dislike of veteran politicians, or a desire for a democratic socialist, or a yearning for an outsider. Clinton is not perfect, but neither was the man she lost to in 2016, nor the man she made the case for Wednesday night. America was taught to see her flaws, but not her strengths. That’s not been a problem for the men she’s run against.

“I think there’s a lot of sexism in the way they went after Hillary,” Biden said in January. “I think it was unfair. An awful lot of it. Well, that’s not gonna happen with me.”

He was right.

Will you become our 20,000th supporter? When the economy took a downturn in the spring and we started asking readers for financial contributions, we weren’t sure how it would go. Today, we’re humbled to say that nearly 20,000 people have chipped in. The reason is both lovely and surprising: Readers told us that they contribute both because they value explanation and because they value that other people can access it, too. We have always believed that explanatory journalism is vital for a functioning democracy. That’s never been more important than today, during a public health crisis, racial justice protests, a recession, and a presidential election. But our distinctive explanatory journalism is expensive, and advertising alone won’t let us keep creating it at the quality and volume this moment requires. Your financial contribution will not constitute a donation, but it will help keep Vox free for all. Contribute today from as little as $3."	left

Guests at the virtual premiere of Cinémoi's documentary film Woman got a special treat Tuesday night from Hillary Clinton.

During the event, the former presidential candidate and secretary of state, 72, surprised attendees with a special message encouraging women around the world.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

The documentary by Anastasia Mikova and Yann Arthus-Bertrand features female heroes across the globe who have survived horrific circumstances to create change despite their difficulties.

More than 2000 women across 50 different countries — discussing motherhood, education, marriage and sexuality — are featured in the project.

""Violence and repression against women all over the world is still shockingly prevalent. Woman is an incredibly vital and important documentary that alerts and informs us all about the urgent and necessary challenge we have in helping women worldwide,"" actress Hilary Swank, 45, who cohosted the premiere with Cinémoi Network president Daphna Ziman, tells PEOPLE in a statement. ""But it is also a film about strength, commonalities and hope that all women share. This is why I wanted to get behind the film.""

Earlier this year, Ziman announced a coalition of women — including Swank, Chaka Khan and Macy Gray — had pledged to help raise $1 million for The Red Cross to help COVID-19 front line workers."	left

gl0qst	hillaryclinton	Hillary Clinton Praises Nancy Pelosi’s Colour Coordination	"Nancy Pelosi is taking the global pandemic very seriously. As the Speaker of the House of Representatives and a congresswoman from San Francisco, Americans, by and large, look to her for guidance, especially in these trying times. For the past few months, she has been encouraging citizens to practice social distancing and wear masks so as to flatten the curve of the coronavirus outbreak. And she is using her wardrobe to get the point across.

At press conferences and events, Pelosi has worn a number of face coverings—from masks to silk scarves—that perfectly complement her selection of brightly colored dress and suit ensembles. She donned a white suit, brown top, and scarf with a graphic sandy print at the signing ceremony for the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act; a cerulean dress with a blue silk scarf at a weekly press conference; a pink pantsuit with a matching face mask at the swearing in of Representative-elect Kweisi Mfume; a white blazer and navy top with a blue patterned mask while making remarks on Capitol Hill; and a salmon-hued scarf with an orange suit at the Capitol Visitor Center.

Unlike many federal authorities in positions of immense power, the congresswoman is following mandates made by the government and health officials to cover one’s respiratory center. Some have worn standard hospital masks and the highly covetable N95 masks, but seeing how personal protective equipment (PPE) is lacking at health facilities across the nation, it can appear out of touch to wear them in front of the cameras when doctors and nurses are making due with scraps.

Indeed, optics in the political arena are important, and Pelosi, perhaps more than most, understands that. Her selection of colorful scarves and masks, though less shielding, does the job just fine. Per a report by The New York Times, using “a fabric with decent filtration potential—like two layers of heavy cotton or flannel—and you wear the mask properly, you increase your chances of avoiding the virus.”

Moreover, the fact that her face coverings match her attire shows that she has not eschewed her personal style. If anything, it conveys that wearing scarves or masks, for the time being, is the new normal, and that citizens should try their best to adapt to the circumstances by using what is available to them. And there are many—including Hillary Clinton, a fellow pantsuit devotee—who are taking notice of Pelosi’s sartorial efforts.

“Leader of the House majority, and of mask-to-pantsuit color coordination,” the former Secretary of State captioned a picture on Instagram of Pelosi wearing her pink pantsuit and mask.

Her tweet linked to an article by Newsweek about Michigan choosing to close down its Capitol and cancel its legislative session after armed protests and death threats to Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.

On Thursday, armed protesters had gathered outside the state Capitol for planned ""judgment day"" demonstrations against the state's stay-at-home order, which opponents have demanded be lifted businesses and the economy suffer during the pandemic.

Some 200 protesters turned out for Thursday's event, where one demonstrator was seen carrying an American flag with a doll hanging by a noose. The event mirrored a similar protest at the end of April, during which hundreds of protesters — many armed with rifles — entered the Capitol.

One man is reportedly facing charges over death threats to Whitmer, and Newsweek reports there have been posts online calling to lynch her as well as suggestions to crowdfund for a hitman."	left

je48dc	hillaryclinton	Hillary Clinton: A National Security Reckoning, How Washington Should Think About Power	"In a year marked by plague and protest, Americans are reckoning with long-overdue questions about racial justice, economic inequality, and disparities in health care. The current crisis should also prompt a reckoning about the United States’ national security priorities. The country is dangerously unprepared for a range of threats, not just future pandemics but also an escalating climate crisis and multidimensional challenges from China and Russia. Its industrial and technological strength has atrophied, its vital supply chains are vulnerable, its alliances are frayed, and its government is hollowed out. In the past, it sometimes has taken a dramatic shock—Pearl Harbor, Sputnik, 9/11—to wake up the United States to a new threat and prompt a major pivot. The COVID-19 crisis should be a big enough jolt to rouse the country from its sleep, so that it can summon its strength and meet the challenges ahead.

Among the highest priorities must be to modernize the United States’ defense capabilities—in particular, moving away from costly legacy weapons systems built for a world that no longer exists. Another is to renew the domestic foundations of its national power—supporting American innovation and bolstering strategically important industries and supply chains. These twin projects are mutually reinforcing. Modernizing the military would free up billions of dollars that could be invested at home in advanced manufacturing and R & D. That would not only help the United States compete with its rivals and prepare for nontraditional threats such as climate change and future pandemics; it would also blunt some of the economic pain caused by budget cuts at the Pentagon. Integrating foreign and domestic policy in this way would make both more effective. And it would help the United States regain its footing in an uncertain world.

SHORTSIGHTED

For decades, policymakers have thought too narrowly about national security and failed to internalize—or fund—a broader approach that encompasses threats not just from intercontinental ballistic missiles and insurgencies but also from cyberattacks, viruses, carbon emissions, online propaganda, and shifting supply chains. There is no more poignant example than the current administration’s failure to grasp that a tourist carrying home a virus can be as dangerous as a terrorist planting a pathogen. President Barack Obama’s national security staff left a 69-page playbook for responding to pandemics, but President Donald Trump’s team ignored it, focusing instead on the threat of bioterrorism. They dismantled the National Security Council’s pandemic directorate, folding it into the office responsible for weapons of mass destruction, and filled a national medical stockpile with drugs for anthrax and smallpox while neglecting the personal protective equipment needed for a pandemic. The Trump administration also shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development program created during my time as secretary of state to detect viral threats around the world, and it has repeatedly tried to slash funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The costs of this misjudgment have been astronomical.

The Trump administration has taken a similarly misguided approach to other nontraditional threats. It omitted any reference to climate change in its 2017 National Security Strategy and attempted to block Rod Schoonover, a senior intelligence official, from briefing Congress about it. The administration also deprioritized cyber-espionage in its trade negotiations with China and failed to confront Russia over its interference in U.S. elections. Unsurprisingly, both countries are at it again.

The problem runs much deeper than Trump, however. Administrations of both parties have long underappreciated the security implications of economic policies that weakened strategically important industries and sent vital supply chains overseas. The foreign policy community understandably focused on how new trade agreements would cement alliances and extend American influence in developing countries. Democrats should have been more willing to hit the brakes on new trade agreements when Republicans obstructed efforts to support workers, create jobs, and invest in hard-hit communities at home. When Republicans failed to use trade-enforcement tools to protect American workers—such as the safeguards against unfair surges of Chinese imports that my husband, President Bill Clinton, negotiated but the Bush administration refused to invoke even a single time—and blocked domestic investments in basic research, infrastructure, and clean energy, Democrats should have more forcefully called their intransigence what it was: not just bad economic policy but a national security liability.

The COVID-19 crisis should be a big enough jolt to rouse the country from its sleep.

Myopia about national security also manifests in the simplistic frames applied to complex challenges, such as insisting on seeing competition with China through the lens of the Cold War. In a speech in July, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo offered this pearl of wisdom: “I grew up and served my time in the army during the Cold War. And if there is one thing I learned, Communists almost always lie.” That’s a remarkably unhelpful way of approaching the challenge. Huffing and puffing about Communists may rile up the Fox News audience, but it obscures the fact that China—along with Russia—poses an altogether different threat from the one the Soviet Union did. Today’s competition is not a traditional global military contest of force and firepower. Dusting off the Cold War playbook will do little to prepare the United States for adversaries that use new tools to fight in the gray zone between war and peace, exploit its open Internet and economy to undermine American democracy, and expose the vulnerability of many of its legacy weapons systems. Nor will such an anachronistic approach build the global cooperation needed to take on shared challenges such as climate change and pandemics.

Meanwhile, the United States’ deep domestic fractures have hamstrung its ability to protect itself and its allies. Consider what happened after the Obama administration painstakingly built an international coalition to force Iran to the negotiating table, including winning the reluctant participation of China and Russia, and then secured a historic agreement to stop Iran’s nuclear program. Trump abruptly renounced the agreement. Now, predictably, Iranian centrifuges are spinning, Tehran is exploring a new alliance with Beijing, and the international sanctions regime is shattered. It’s a frustrating, self-inflicted wound and a reminder of the costs of inconstancy.

The problem is not always too much change; in some areas, it’s too little. The overmilitarization of U.S. foreign policy is a bad habit that goes all the way back to the days when President Dwight Eisenhower warned of “the military-industrial complex.” Many generals understand what James Mattis told Congress when he led U.S. Central Command: “If you don’t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition ultimately.” But many politicians are too afraid of being attacked as soft on defense to listen. So they pile mission after mission on the Pentagon and authorize ballooning military budgets while starving civilian agencies. And, it’s important to emphasize, for decades, right-wing ideological resistance has blocked crucial investments in American diplomacy and development abroad and American innovation at home—from foreign aid budgets to domestic infrastructure and R & D spending.

THE OBSTACLES TO MODERNIZATION

Like the broader government, the military itself can be slow to adapt to new threats. After the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, there were fatal delays in getting up-armored Humvees and lifesaving body armor to troops in the field. Now, the Pentagon is again at risk of being caught unprepared for the very different demands of competing with China. I saw how hard it can be to move a bureaucracy as sprawling as the Pentagon when, in 2004, I was asked to be the only U.S. senator on the Joint Forces Command’s Transformation Advisory Group, which was charged with helping the military reimagine itself for the twenty-first century. The Defense Department had assembled an impressive team of military and civilian experts from a range of disciplines and told them to think as big and boldly as possible, yet our efforts to recommend reforms ran into some of the same obstacles that remain today. Powerful players in the Pentagon, Congress, and the private sector have built careers—and, in some cases, fortunes—doing things a certain way. They have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo.

To be sure, when lives are on the line, it can be more prudent to rely on proven practices than untested innovations. And decisions about military posture and procurement have profound economic and political implications that should not be overlooked. As a senator, I represented many New York communities dependent on defense jobs, and I did everything I could to keep bases open and factories humming, whether it was funding the production of new howitzer tubes at the Watervliet Arsenal and the development of advanced radar systems on Long Island or bolstering the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum. I knew how much the jobs meant for my constituents, and I was convinced that each of the appropriations had national security merit. Yet multiply that dynamic across 50 states and 435 congressional districts, and it becomes clear why it’s so hard to retire aging weapons systems or close bases that have outlived their usefulness.

Today, the poster child for this political reality is the F-35 fighter. Development of the plane ran way behind schedule and over budget, and it is estimated to cost $1 trillion over its lifespan, yet it is considered untouchable. The air force sank so much time and money into the project that turning back became unthinkable, especially since the F-35 is the only fifth-generation aircraft currently being manufactured in the United States. And because the plane directly and indirectly supports hundreds of thousands of jobs across hundreds of congressional districts in nearly every state, it has legions of defenders in Congress.

A SMARTER DEFENSE BUDGET

These obstacles to reforming the military are not new, but they are newly urgent. The Pentagon must adapt to a strategic landscape far different from the one it faced during the Cold War or the war on terrorism. New technologies such as artificial intelligence are rendering old systems obsolete and creating opportunities that no country has yet mastered but many are seeking. Then there are the particularly thorny challenges in East Asia. While the American military was fighting costly land wars in the Middle East, China was investing in relatively cheap anti-access/area-denial weapons, such as antiship ballistic missiles, which pose credible threats to the United States’ expensive aircraft carriers.

No one should make the mistake of believing that the People’s Liberation Army is ten feet tall or that the competition with China is primarily a military contest. China has relied on financial coercion and economic statecraft to gain influence as it builds infrastructure around the world. In recent years, while the Trump administration was gutting the State Department and undermining U.S. alliances in Asia and Europe, China was doubling its diplomacy budget and pouring untold billions into developing countries, now outstripping American aid. China today has more diplomatic posts around the world than the United States does.

That said, the military challenge from China is real. The United States should not be lulled into a false sense of security by its continuing firepower advantage or the fact that its defense budget remains orders of magnitude larger than Beijing’s. China’s advances mean that the United States’ air and sea superiority in the region is no longer ensured. This isn’t competition from a military equal but a new kind of asymmetric threat. Americans learned in the sands of Afghanistan and Iraq that asymmetry can be deadly, and the same is true in the skies and seas of East Asia. To make matters worse, the United States must meet this challenge with a military that has been damaged by Trump’s mismanagement. He has degraded civilian oversight of the Pentagon by leaving scores of key posts vacant. At the same time, he has attempted to turn the military into part of his political machine—pardoning war criminals over the objections of military leaders and deploying National Guard troops in Lafayette Square so that he could stage a photo op.

Modernizing and refocusing the military will take both vision and backbone. A big part of the effort will have to involve overhauling the defense budget. Deep savings—potentially hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade—can and should be found by retiring legacy weapons systems. But choices about where to cut and where to spend must be driven by a clear-eyed analysis of national security needs, not politics. The United States can’t afford to repeat the mistakes of the 2013 budget sequestration, when Congress forced the Pentagon to slash budgets indiscriminately, with no overarching strategy. This work is going to require a president and a secretary of defense who are rigorous in their analysis and comfortable consulting with Congress and the military brass but prepared to make difficult decisions about which missions to prioritize and which to de-emphasize or eliminate. To insulate these decisions from political pressure, Congress should agree to take an up-or-down vote on a comprehensive package of defense reforms—a process that has been used in the past for closing military bases—rather than haggling over each adjustment.

Changes to the budget should aim to prepare the United States for asymmetric conflict with technologically advanced adversaries. For example, aircraft carriers still play an important role in U.S. power projection around the world but are vulnerable to Chinese antiship missiles, which cost a fraction of the price. In addition, only a handful of the U.S. Navy’s 11 aircraft carriers are usually operational and at sea at any given time, with onerous maintenance keeping others in port. Instead of continuing to expand the fleet of vulnerable surface ships, the navy should invest in accelerated maintenance and next-generation submarines. Similarly, as anti-access/area-denial weapons force U.S. aircraft carriers and guided-missile cruisers to stay farther away from potential targets, the U.S. Air Force will have to focus less on short-range tactical fighter planes and more on long-range capabilities. That means it won’t need nearly as many F-35s as planned, but it should welcome the arrival of the B-21 Raider, a long-range bomber under development that is designed to thwart advanced air defenses. These capabilities must be accompanied by mechanisms that allow for consultation with China and Russia to reduce the chances that a long-range conventional attack is mistaken for a nuclear strike, which could lead to disastrous escalation.

As the United States leaves behind a period dominated by land wars and looks ahead to potential air, sea, and space conflicts, the army should accept the risks that come with a smaller active-duty ground force. A force with fewer soldiers and heavy tanks would match the strategic moment and cost far less. Maintaining fewer active-component armored brigade combat teams, for example, could save tens of billions of dollars over the next decade. Instead of heavy tanks, the military should be investing in tools that will give troops an edge in the conflicts of the future, including upgraded communications and intelligence systems.

Modernizing and refocusing the military will take both vision and backbone.

Perhaps most important, the United States needs a new approach to nuclear weapons. For starters, it should not be deploying low-yield nuclear warheads on submarines or nuclear-armed cruise missiles, which expand the range of scenarios for the use of nuclear weapons and increase the risk of a misunderstanding escalating quickly into a full-blown nuclear exchange. Nor should the United States spend $1 trillion over the next 30 years on its nuclear arsenal, as is currently planned. Instead, it should significantly reduce its reliance on old intercontinental ballistic missiles, pursue a “newer and fewer” approach to modernization, and revive the arms control diplomacy that the Trump administration scrapped. A top priority should be to extend the New START treaty with Russia, which Ellen Tauscher, the State Department’s top arms control official, and I helped negotiate at the beginning of the Obama administration. It will also be important to persuade China to join nuclear negotiations.

A renewed commitment to diplomacy would strengthen the United States’ military position. U.S. alliances are an asset that neither China nor Russia can match, allowing Washington to project force around the world. When I was secretary of state, for example, we secured an agreement to base 2,500 U.S. marines in northern Australia, near the contested sea-lanes of the South China Sea. Yet Trump treats the U.S. alliance system as nothing more than a protection racket—for example, warning NATO partners that they must “either pay the United States for its great military protection, or protect themselves.” Although it’s appropriate to emphasize the need for burden sharing, it is more constructive to think of a division of labor. As the United States focuses on modernizing its air and sea capabilities, it will make sense for other NATO members to concentrate on strengthening their conventional ground forces so that they can deter incursions in eastern Europe or lead counterterrorism missions in Africa.

REBUILDING SELF-SUFFICIENCY

That is how the United States should modernize its approach to defense—one of the three Ds, along with diplomacy and development, that for more than a decade I have said should be integrated as part of a “smart power” strategy. Now, it’s time to add a fourth D: domestic renewal, the rebuilding of the country’s industrial and technological strength.

The United States’ dwindling industrial capacity and inadequate investment in scientific research leave the country dangerously dependent on China and unprepared for future crises. The problem goes back decades. When the USS Cole was bombed in 2000, I was shocked to learn that there was only one American company left that manufactured the specialized steel needed to repair the ship’s hull. Twenty years later, the pandemic has underscored how much the United States relies on China and other countries for vital imports—not just lifesaving medical supplies but also raw materials such as rare-earth minerals and electronic equipment that powers everything from telecommunications to weapons systems.

The United States should pursue a plan like the one proposed by former Vice President Joe Biden to invest $700 billion in innovation and manufacturing and impose stronger “Buy American” provisions, with the goal of jump-starting domestic production in key sectors—from steel to robotics to biotechnology—reshoring sensitive supply chains, and expanding strategic stockpiles of essential goods. It’s time for ambitious industrial policies. China does whatever it can to gain an advantage, including conducting industrial espionage on a massive scale, pursuing a range of unfair trade practices, and providing virtually unlimited resources to state-owned and state-backed enterprises. The United States doesn’t need to cheat or steal, but it can’t afford to compete with one hand tied behind its back.

The United States can’t afford to compete with one hand tied behind its back.

Although it is a mistake to use national security as a catchall justification for blanket protectionist trade policies, as Trump has done, policymakers should widen the range of industries and resources deemed vital to it. It’s not enough anymore to prioritize materials and technologies used for weapons systems and semiconductors; the United States’ security also depends on the control of pharmaceuticals, clean energy, 5G networks, and artificial intelligence. That’s one reason it’s crucial to reverse the long-term decline in the federal share of spending on R & D. Another reason is that investments in basic science and medical research can yield huge economic gains: economists at MIT have estimated that increasing federal funding for research in the United States by 0.5 percent of GDP, or about $100 billion per year, would create some four million jobs.

Massive new investments in advanced manufacturing and R & D will be expensive, but they are necessary for the United States’ long-term economic and security interests and will pay off for years to come. Critics will no doubt warn that running up the national debt is itself a national security risk. But at a time of historically low real interest rates and historically high unemployment, the country should not shy away from bold investments. There is a growing consensus among economists that Washington need not be paralyzed by fears of debt and that it can afford to spend heavily on critical national investments that bring high returns, especially during a crisis. Indeed, what the United States cannot afford is to defer these investments any longer.

AN INTEGRATED APPROACH

These two agendas—military modernization and domestic renewal—should be integrated. Moving away from outdated weapons systems will cause economic disruption and real hardship. That’s why it should be done in tandem with targeted investments in economically struggling communities, bringing advanced manufacturing and R & D to the places most affected by defense cuts. In fact, as a study by economists at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, has found, $1 billion spent on clean energy, health care, or education creates, on average, far more jobs than the same amount of military spending.

I’m not suggesting telling laid-off factory workers to reinvent themselves as coders; that’s fanciful and condescending. Previous pledges to support workers who lost their jobs because of defense cuts or trade policies have often fallen abysmally short. But the U.S. government can do more to help displaced workers and those leaving the military transition to the millions of new jobs that could be created through major new domestic investments. In 2008, when the U.S. Air Force retired the F-16s based at Hancock Field Air National Guard Base, in Syracuse, New York, I helped secure funding to turn the base into one of the military’s first major drone bases, saving hundreds of jobs. American history is full of examples of factories, communities, and entire industries pivoting when they had to. During World War II, the auto industry shifted gears with incredible speed to make tanks and bombers. At the beginning of the pandemic, it shifted swiftly again, to produce desperately needed ventilators and personal protective equipment. With the right long-term investments, communities can reinvent themselves successfully. Pittsburgh, once a center of steel production, has become a hub for health care, robotics, and research on autonomous vehicles.

Many legacy weapons systems are built or based in communities with skilled workforces that can and should be the backbone of the country’s renewed self-sufficiency. Think of Syracuse, which has long been a center of defense manufacturing, a bright spot in an otherwise difficult economic picture. In 2017, the Brookings Institution ranked Syracuse dead last for economic growth out of 100 U.S. metro areas, so it could ill afford to lose any of the defense jobs keeping the region afloat. Yet a 2019 ranking by a pair of MIT economists put the city as the third most promising technology hub in the country, thanks to its skilled workers and low cost of living. It’s exactly the kind of place where significant public investments in advanced manufacturing, clean energy, and R & D could create good jobs and help the United States outcompete China.

Washington need not be paralyzed by fears of debt.

So is Lima, Ohio. Hundreds of people work at the city’s Abrams tank factory. Even though General Ray Odierno, then chief of staff of the U.S. Army, told legislators in 2012, “We don’t need the tanks,” Congress kept the factory open. It’s true that the plant’s workers and their community have devoted themselves to protecting the United States, and the country absolutely must keep faith with them. It’s also true that the military still doesn’t need the tanks. But if the United States is to get serious about climate change, what it does need are more factories to churn out clean electric vehicles. The Pentagon alone should replace most of its fleet of 200,000 nontactical vehicles with electric. Some of those new vehicles could be built in Lima, which is already home to a large Ford engine factory. And that’s just one possibility. If Washington decides to boost domestic production of next-generation electric batteries, wind turbines, and other strategically significant products, Northwest Ohio is a natural place to do it.

No one should pretend that every defense job can be saved or replaced. Cutting hundreds of billions of dollars in military spending over the next decade will inevitably inflict a painful toll on families and communities across the country. But if the government can pair these cuts with major new investments in affected communities, it can minimize the economic damage and maximize the United States’ ability to compete with China and prepare for future challenges.

All of this requires leadership from the top. Having a commander in chief with no experience—and no empathy or vision—has been a disaster. But it’s hard to imagine a man better suited to lead the work ahead than Biden, a former chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who has deep expertise in national security policy, a military father who knows how much the country owes its men and women in uniform and their families, and a champion of working people who fought to save the auto industry when others would have let it go bankrupt.

In the throes of a crisis as dire as any the United States has seen in many decades, it can be difficult to imagine what the world will look like in four months, let alone four years. But the country needs to be thinking now about the threats it will face in a post-pandemic future, as well as the opportunities it must seize. As former Secretary of State Dean Acheson recounted in his memoirs, when George Marshall led the State Department, he urged his team to look ahead, “not into the distant future, but beyond the vision of the operating officers caught in the smoke and crises of current battle; far enough ahead to see the emerging form of things to come.” The United States should endeavor to do the same today. To look beyond the current battle and prepare to lead the post-COVID world, it must broaden its approach to national security and renew the foundations of its national power."	left

i01xl8	hillaryclinton	The Hunting of Hillary	"In January 1979, Hillary Rodham Clinton, the first lady of Arkansas, was confronted by a male reporter during an interview for a local television station. “Does it concern you,” he asked, “that maybe other people feel that you don’t fit the image that we have created for the governor’s wife in Arkansas?”

Hillary Clinton, as depicted on cover of new book, Hunting for Hillary, by Pulitzer Prize-winning political biographer Michael D’Antonio.

In March 1992, columnist William Safire declared, in the midst of accusations of bad behavior facing presidential contender Bill Clinton, that his campaign really just had a “Hillary Problem.” Early on in her husband’s presidency, Clinton was subjected to more of the same kind of treatment when columnist David Brock claimed that a member of her staff had said “the devil’s in that woman.”

By 2016, followers of Donald Trump were chanting “lock her up” at political rallies, and merchandise mocking Clinton saturated digital marketplaces.

“The meaner they are,” admitted one woman selling buttons making blow job jokes at Clinton’s expense, “the more people buy them.”

Pulitzer Prize-winning political biographer Michael D’Antonio recounts dozens of moments like these in The Hunting of Hillary. His compelling examination of the “vast, right-wing conspiracy” to take down the esteemed former first lady and secretary of state is immaculately compiled, exposing how her political opponents used sexist attacks to paint Clinton as a “ball-busting feminist” and frigid wife; a power-hungry “Lady Macbeth” and even a manipulative murderer. Along the way, he writes, they eroded political institutions, not only to damage Clinton’s political prospects, but to consolidate their own power.

The Hunting of Hillary: The Forty-Year Campaign to Destroy Hillary Clinton, by Michael D’Antonio.

Bill Clinton’s 1992 arrival in Washington, D.C., marked the end of a 24-year period of Republican rule in the White House. Lacking strong policies or candidates to help them regain their footing, D’Antonio suggests, Republicans took aim at the president’s wife. Lawmakers, lobbyists and media personalities, funded by a handful of billionaires, built a cottage industry on “Hillary Hate” over four decades—launching media platforms, publishing houses and political careers by way of sexist smear campaigns.

People on both sides of the aisle tire of being asked to confront this ugly history, but D’Antonio’s stirring account demands that we consider it further, especially now: Four years after Hillary Clinton won more individual votes than any white male candidate for president in U.S. history, voters this year will find themselves choosing between two white men at the ballot box in yet another presidential election shaped by the persistently sexist media coverage of women candidates and widespread harassment of their supporters.

More than 40 years after her husband first campaigned for public office, the persistent attacks on Clinton’s career and character remain a driving force in our polarized and dysfunctional political landscape.

Many of the men who built this campaign have become household names, and some are Trump’s foremost coconspirators. Brett Kavanaugh, decades before Trump promoted him to the Supreme Court, worked under prosecutor Kenneth Starr to extract lurid details about the president’s affair with Monica Lewinsky for public consumption during his impeachment hearings. Rudy Giuliani, now an attorney for the president, launched a senatorial campaign in 2000 just to stop Clinton from winning hers. Newt Gingrich would help launch the Benghazi conspiracy against Clinton in 2012—and then be appointed an adviser to the Trump campaign, and his wife an ambassador during the Trump presidency. Rush Limbaugh, who launched a career on Hillary Hate and popularized the term feminazi in the ’90s, was awarded a Presidential Medal of Freedom by Trump in 2020.

D’Antonio argues that the echo chamber of misinformation and conspiracy theories that grew out of these connected efforts to take down one woman also became the foundation of the Russian interference that undermined Clinton’s campaign for the White House. Sexism was a key component of the click-bait disruption to our democracy: Those churning out content for the effort were instructed to “use any opportunity to criticize Hillary.”

“[Trump’s] election didn’t mark the start of something new,” D’Antonio asserts at the outset of the book, “but rather the logical conclusion of something much bigger.”

Until we grapple with the sexism that shapes that something bigger, we may be doomed to continue reliving it.

hvzlgh	hillaryclinton	Hillary Clinton Alternative History Series in Development at Hulu	"Hulu has optioned the rights to Curtis Sittenfeld’s alternative history book “Rodham,” which takes place in a world in which Hillary Rodham never married Bill Clinton.

The series is described as telling the story of an ambitious young woman, developing her extraordinary mind in the latter part of the 20th century, moving from idealism to cynicism and all the way back again.

Sarah Treem is attached to write and executive produce the project. “The Handmaid’s Tale” executive producer Warren Littlefield will also executive produce “Rodham” via The Littlefield Company along with Sittenfeld. Fox 21 Television Studios, where Littlefield is under an overall deal, will produce.

Should the show go to series, it would be the second project focused on Hillary Clinton that Hulu has aired. The streamer debuted the four-part docuseries “Hillary” back in March. That series chronicled her 2016 presidential campaign while also delving into events from her past that shaped her life.

“Rodham” was originally published back in May and went on to become a New York Times bestseller. Sittenfeld’s other books include “You Think I’ll Say It,” “Eligible,” “Sisterland,” and “American Wife.”

Treem was previously the co-creator and showrunner on Showtime’s critically-acclaimed series “The Affair.” Her other credits include “In Treatment,” “House of Cards,” and “How to Make It in America.” Variety exclusively reported in May that the Gal Gadot-led series about Hedy Lamarr, which Treem will write and executive produce, has been set up at Apple with a straight-to-series order. Littlefield is also an executive producer on that project."	left
loaj9i	hillaryclinton	The Life and Death of a Woman-Hater	"As Mr. Trump would later, Mr. Limbaugh had Mrs. Clinton, and the conservative public’s insatiable appetite for attacks on her, partly to thank for his success. And like Mr. Trump, Mr. Limbaugh then further wielded his huge platform to threaten and denigrate smart, ambitious, politically involved women.

In 1992, Mr. Limbaugh introduced the term “feminazi,” a pejorative he assigned women who spoke out for their own rights generally, and for abortion rights specifically. It was his preferred term, he said, for “women who are obsessed with perpetuating a modern-day Holocaust: abortion.”

Girls were not spared his ire. Mr. Limbaugh told viewers of his television show in 1993: “Socks is the White House cat. But did you know there is also a White House dog?” And he held up a photograph of Chelsea Clinton, who at the time was just 13 years old. Two decades later, as he established a steady patter of racist and misogynistic hate aimed at Barack and Michelle Obama, Mr. Limbaugh took to calling Mrs. Obama “Moochelle,” reinforcing the idea that women are only as valuable as their looks — a rule that he did not seem to apply to men.

That Mr. Limbaugh’s fortunes grew with this kind of extreme and schlocky rhetoric, could not have been lost on conservative politicians. The victories of the civil rights and feminist movements in the 1960s and ’70s had forced a great reorganization in American politics, with the Republican Party seizing opportunities for growth among whites angry about progress toward racial equality, and among men who resented women’s changing roles and growing power in the workplace, society and the family.

Mr. Limbaugh was the ur-character of this new kind of conservative Republican: one who spoke out loudly for traditional values — which in this case meant male authority over women — as well as the cultural, political and economic dominance of whites. But unlike many Republican politicians, he eschewed dog whistles and code words in favor of unvarnished bigotry. His talk radio show soon became the most popular in America, riding a wave of white male resentment as well as helping to stoke it.

Aware of his reach, Republican politicians began competing for his listeners’ votes. That meant firmly solidifying themselves as opponents of women’s rights, privacy and progress.

As much as moderate Republicans may have publicly, at least occasionally, wrung their hands over Mr. Limbaugh’s boorishness, they were happy to support his politics. Perhaps the best case study of Mr. Limbaugh’s grotesque efforts happened in 2012, after Sandra Fluke, a Georgetown law student, testified before Congress to urge mandatory coverage of contraception in the Affordable Care Act, which many congressional Republicans opposed."	left
muiilg	hillaryclinton	Total Meltdown: How One Emoji From Hillary Clinton Set Off A Delicious Explosion in The Midst of Bernie Twitter	"







Like what you read? Leave a Tip.





One emoji. One emoji from Hillary Clinton is all it took to set the entire Bernie Sanders social-media sphere in complete and total meltdown mode.Clinton, whose righteous indignation against Bernie Sanders is an oasis of sanity for many, promoted a tweet that featured a video clip of hers from 1993 advocating for health care reform. The original tweet, by the commentator Chantay Berry , noted that Hillary Clinton beat Bernie Sanders by about 27 years on the idea of lowering the eligibility age for Medicare, something Sanders’s fanclub has hailed as the best thing since running water now that Sanders has said he’s for it.Clinton’s contribution to the conversation? One emoji. She quote-tweeted Berry with a single, googly eyed emoji.She may as well have thrown a lit match into a pool of gasoline. Cosplay socialist Twitter-sphere exploded.Briahna Joy Gray, former Bernie Sanders national spokesperson who once danced for joy that Donald Trump, rather than Hillary Clinton, would become president because of far left’s hatred for Hillary, scolded Clinton for promoting content from a “#KHive woman,” and demanded that Clinton apologize for doing so.It’s a little rich for Gray to demand others disavow “toxic, hate-fueled politics” when in literally her next tweet she screenshots an insane article trashing Harris fans by Matt Orfalea, a former colleague of Gray’s at the Sanders campaign. Before he was hired as part of the Sanders video team, Orfalea once edited MLK’s I have a dream speech to insert sexual innuendos . After he left the Sanders campaign, Orfalea recorded himself making live phone calls to trash Joe Biden to voters from a Biden campaign caller list.Now, I think Chantay Berry would be the first to tell you that she is indeed a “KHive woman,” - the group of online supporters of Kamala Harris led predominantly by Black women - as pejoratively as Gray may have used the term. But the toxic, knee-jerk, anti-Kamala Harris resentment that fueled this phenomenal meltdown from Gray and others isThe KHive is everything cosplay socialist Twitter fancies itself as but never will be.That has to do with the purposes of the two groups. Although both the KHive and Berniebros rose to advocate for their respective candidates for president, socialist cosplay Twitter quickly transformed itself into a cartoonish personality cult. They attacked everyone daring to speak ill of their messiah, and deployed abhorrent tactics like ad-hominem attacks, trolling people on social media, and exposing the personal and employment information of private individuals.The KHive took a different tact to defending its candidate of choice: they call it receipts. Lie about Harris online, and an army of well-informed respondents will come at you with links to news articles, video clips, legislative language, and documented policy positions. They’ll be unforgiving, and they might even dig up your own bad social media takes, but they will not demand that you worship at the altar of Kamala Harris.Bottom line: The KHive will set you straight for lying about Kamala, but the Benriebros will make your life hell for telling the truth about Bernie.There’s another important difference between the online supporters of most other candidates and the Bernie Sanders fanclub: for supporters of most other candidates, their candidates exemplified their causes. For supporters of Bernie Sanders, their candidate exemplified their grievances. That is why when Harris dropped out, KHive quickly coalesced around Joe Biden, and in honesty, so did the online supporters of Pete Buttigueg, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke, and other Democratic candidates after their candidates left the race. By contrast, Bernie’s true believers continue their nagging grievances against Biden to this day, and outshined by Harris, they are triggered at every time the KHive gets any kudos.Berniebros had thought they owned the online space, and KHive not only beat them in the primary by getting behind Biden but got their candidate elected as the second-in-command. Cosplay socialists have never gotten over that.That is why at the center of this recent meltdown is not something that Hillary Clinton said, but her act of highlighting the work done by a Harris supporter. They hate Hillary Clinton, and they hate Kamala Harris, but what they really can’t stand is people in KHive getting any credit.Clinton, of course, has always been a fan of Harris’s (and vice versa). Those who followed last year’s Democratic primary closely will note that Clinton did not enter the foray until Tulsi Gabbard started smearing Harris. Clinton then torched Gabbard’s candidacy by exposing her for being propped up by Russians without ever saying her name. Sanders backers who were particularly pleased with Gabbard’s sharp jabs against Harris were incensed.But Clinton had hit Gabbard where it hurt. Less than a week after Clinton took Gabbard to task, Gabbard announced that she would not run for re-election to Congress, effectively ending her political career.There are some politicians who occupy all their time with their own grievances, and that rubs off on their supporters who become obsessed with birthing conspiracy theories about how their dear leader was cheated. Then there are leaders who come through the most agonizing experiences in their lives and pledge never to let that happen to the next person.The first group makes noise. The second, history."	left

k8mt2q	hillaryclinton	Kamala - the triumph of women in the United States	"In a tweet ahead of the US election, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden wrote, ‘Big news! : I've chosen Kamala Harris as my running mate.' The news was really great, was made clear by the new history of the US presidential election on November 3, 2020.

And that history is the triumph of women in American politics. Because Kamala Harris became the first woman vice president of the United States. No woman has previously been elected to one of the top two positions in the United States. Nancy Pelosi became the first female speaker in the United States.

""But while I may be the first woman in this office, I won’t be the last,"" Kamala said in a speech from the Victory Stage in Wilmington, Delaware, on November 8, after the victory was confirmed.

But I am not the end. ' She addressed the children, especially every girl child, saying, 'Our country has sent you a clear message: dream with ambition, lead with conviction, and see yourself in a way that others might not see you, simply because they’ve never seen it before.'



Really, this is a story of women moving forward in the United States! Women in the United States first got the right to vote in 1920. Exactly 100 years ago. And 100 years later, in 2020, women were represented for the first time in one of the two most important positions in the United States.





However, Nancy Pelosi became the first woman speaker in the history of the United States. She was the Speaker of the House of Representatives from 2008 to 2011. She became a member of the House of Representatives in 1986.





She has been a speaker since the time of Barack Obama. Democratic lawmakers in Congress on Thursday re-elected her speaker of the House of Representatives for two years. She is the most powerful person in the United States Congress at her age of 60 years. Women have come a long way to achieve this.



Geraldine Ferraro became the first woman to run for vice president in 1974, along with Democrat Walter Mandel. However, she could not become vice president.





Alaska's female governor, Sarah Palin, was nominated for vice president in 2008 alongside Republican presidential candidate John McCain. He also could not be vice president.





In 2016, Hillary Clinton became the first woman candidate of the Democratic Party for the presidency. But despite winning more than 3 million popular votes, Hillary lost the electoral vote to Trump.





This time, Kamala became the Vice President and said that women are no longer an issue in politics in the United States. Earlier, Madeleine Albright was President Clinton's secretary of state as a woman.





Condoleezza Rice was President Bush's secretary of state. Hillary Clinton has served as powerful Secretary of State under the Obama administration.





Two other women ministers in the Obama administration are Janet Napolitano and Hilda Solis in the Ministries of Homeland Security and Labor.



Hillary Clinton did not win the presidency in 2016, that's right. However, in 2017, a record number of women entered the US Senate. The number of women legislators in the state is more. In 2017, 1,830 women served in 50 state legislatures.





In addition, 20 percent of the mayors of cities with a population of more than 30,000 are women. In the mid-term elections of 2018, a record number of 98 women became members of the House of Representatives.





Until the 2018 election, 322 women served in the US Congress. Of these, 208 are from the Democratic Party and 114 are from the Republicans.



This election has created an awakening among women as Kamala Harris has become the first woman vice president of the United States. According to AFP, Kamala has energized female voters in the United States. In many cities in the United States, there has been a lot of talk about Kamala.





Lawyer Theodora told AFP in her response that Kamala is a wonderful role model to girls. Joe Biden is going to make Michèle Flournoy, a woman, the secretary of defense in his cabinet. This will also be new history.



Kamala Harris, the daughter of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father, went to the polls for the first time in 2003 after entering American politics. She became the District Attorney of San Francisco, California.





In 2010, she was elected Attorney General of California. In 2016, she was elected senator of California. The children of two immigrants are now the first female vice president of the United States.



In her autobiography, ""The Truth We Hold"", Kamala Harris writes that ""Kamol"" means lotus, a symbol of significance in Indian culture. The name 'Kamala' is taken from there.





Her mom, Shyamla Gopalan immigrated to the United States from Tamil Nadu, India. She was a cancer researcher and rights activist. Father Donald Harris was born in Jamaica.





She taught at Stanford University. She was born in Auckland, California, to the children of these two immigrants. The parents separated at the age of five. Kamala and her sister Maya grew up in a mixed culture with their mother. They have also come to visit India with their mother.





But my mother knew that the people of the country she had chosen to live in would accept Kamala and Maya as black. Mother raised us in that culture.





She was admitted to Howard University, which was k nown as the ‘University of Blacks’ in Washington DC. There she studied political science and economics. She then studied law at the University of California.



However, Howard University has had the greatest impact on her in terms of constructive experience in life. Mother Shyamla died in 2009. Kamala married lawyer Douglas Emhoff in 2014 in keeping with Indian and Jewish traditions.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)

Just like 2016 and 2018, the 2020 election in Florida did not go to plan for Democrats. Leading up to the election, opinion polls had Joe Biden up by just about 2.5%. Florida looked close, but it seemed as though it would follow the lead of the majority of US voters and go blue. Thats not what happened. Despite losing the White House, Mr. Trump carried the state fairly easily. The past two election cycles, 2020 and 2018, had good national environments for democrats, yet they could not seem to eke out a win in Florida. If even on good years, Democrats cannot win, when can they?

For most of the state’s history, it has had Democratic leadership. Yet over the past 20 years, there have been only four Democrats to win Florida in a state wide election — President Barrack Obama, Senator Bill Nelson, Attorney General Alex Sink, and Agriculture Commissioner Niki Field. Out of the state’s 34 or so state wide elections since the turn of the century, 27 of them have been won by the GOP.

What has been causing this shift? One answer is demographics. The state’s population is growing, and this growth is fueled by older white people. It is projected that between 2000 and 2030, 53.2% of Florida’s population growth will come from 60 year olds and over. Older Americans are much more likely to vote than younger groups, and vote Republican. Despite Biden making some gains with this group, this demographic shift will make Florida quite difficult for Democrats to win in the coming future.

Another demographic group that has contributed to Florida’s rightward shift has been Cuban Americans. While it is true, Cuban Americans have a history of voting Republican, there has been a shift towards the Republicans in how they vote. The Florida GOP has done a great job courting Cuban Americans. This is due to their effective outreach efforts and Cuban American’s perception that Democrats are truly socialists. Mr. Biden managed to flip three counties Mr. Trump won in 2016, including two rather large ones, Duval and Pinellas. Yet, Democratic support bled out of Miami at a rate in which those wins were unable to make up the difference. It was not just in 2020, Mr. Gillum in 2018, and Ms. Clinton in 2016 underperformed Mr. Obama’s 2012 and 2008 numbers in Miami-Date county, likely costing both of them the election.

It seems Florida is going down the same path as Ohio, a swing state turning red after losing its shade of purple. Democrats could try to stop this by reaching out more to Cuban Americans or older whites. Both seem like a tall order when other states such as Arizona, Georgia, and maybe even Texas, seem more posed for their taking in the near future."	left

kbjdhm	hillaryclinton	The Supreme Court's clear message to President Trump: Stop	"(CNN) During the past four years, President Donald Trump has challenged the integrity of the Supreme Court and tried to drag the justices into the legal muck with him.

His arguments have pushed the boundaries of the law and his assertions have tested the impartiality of individual justices. But Trump's meritless attack on the November election and his loss to Joe Biden in a brazen lawsuit initiated by the Texas attorney general brought the court into a wholly new realm.

The high court slapped down the case promoted by Trump on Friday, three days before the Electoral College will meet to cast votes for Biden as the winner of the November election, with no noted dissents.

As such, the court's justices, six of whom were appointed by Republican presidents, three by Trump, have separated themselves from the pattern of hard-core partisans who were asking the court to use baseless claims of widespread voter fraud to disenfranchise millions of voters.

If the justices had not rejected the request from Texas and other Republican-led states, they would have defied their own precedent and compromised any notion of neutrality.

For the Supreme Court itself, there has always been a question of how it emerges from Trump's legally fraught four years. Many of his policy initiatives -- and some of his personal financial dealings -- were subject to lawsuits.

And the President routinely suggested that once a case reached the conservative-dominated bench, he would prevail. His Twitter posts and other rhetoric have constantly undermined the notion of neutral judges. He implied Democratic appointees would automatically rule against him and Republican appointees would side with him.

On Friday afternoon, a few hours before the justices' order in Texas v. Pennsylvania, Trump tweeted, ""If the Supreme Court shows Great Wisdom and Courage, the American People will win perhaps the most important case in history and our Electoral Process will be respected again!""

He had pushed for swift Senate confirmation in October of his third appointee, Amy Coney Barrett, to succeed the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg, saying the court might end up deciding the election. (Barrett did not recuse herself from the Texas case.)

Before Trump brought the country to this point on the election, his policy agenda had bitterly divided the nine justices, such as on the travel ban that affected majority-Muslim countries and his attempt to end the ""Dreamers"" program for young immigrants who came to the US without proper papers.

Trump prevailed on the first, in 2018, and lost on the second, just this year. The administration generally did better in the early years, as the court majority soon grew frustrated with the Trump team's failure to comply with procedural norms.

In opinions written by Chief Justice John Roberts, the court found that the administration contrived a rationale for a proposed citizenship question on the 2020 census and, separately, failed to justify its rollback of protections for ""Dreamers"" in the Obama-sponsored Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , or DACA, program.

But Trump could usually count on two or more justices on the right-wing to endorse his positions.

In the election case, not a single justice expressed any openness to the Texas and Trump assertions of election irregularities. Friday night's order was unsigned.

The only other comment in the court's action may be mainly of interest to the legal community, rather than relevant to the election results. In asking the justices to exercise its ""original jurisdiction,"" Paxton tried to vault over lower courts and brush aside rulings against the President and his allies. Only Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas wrote a separate statement saying they would have given Texas permission to file the case. But they also said they would not have granted any claims.

The substance of the case aside, the sloppiness of some of filings might have generated additional frustrations for the justices. The apparent haste in which many were put together reinforced the overall weakness of the arguments. A brief from GOP states that included Louisiana spelled it ""Lousiana."" The filing from GOP lawmakers placed Republican Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey from South Carolina instead. Advocates for the ""New California"" and ""New Nevada"" states, siding with Texas, repeatedly misspelled the name of current California Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Trump vs. The Roberts Court

Over his tenure, Trump has split the high court and put Roberts on the defensive.

After Trump derided a judge who ruled against him in November 2018 as an ""Obama judge,"" Roberts issued a statement: ""We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.""

The Roberts Court majority has sided with the President's positions more often than not, particularly on pro-corporate, anti-immigrant, and conservative religious liberty claims. But there have been recent high-profile losses, including the DACA case this year, that have drawn Trump's wrath on Twitter.

The administration may be headed for another. Based on the justices' comments during arguments over the Affordable Care Act in November, Trump may soon lose his attempt to kill Obamacare. During arguments, Roberts expressed frustration that opponents of the law that has brought health insurance coverage to 20 million more Americans had failed to end it legislatively and were asking the judicial branch to do it for them.

Irrespective of whether the justices ruled for the administration or its challengers, Roberts took pains to signal the justices' independence.

""We should celebrate our strong and independent judiciary, a key source of national unity and stability,"" Roberts wrote in his 2019 year-end message. ""But we should also remember that justice is not inevitable.""

Texas and its supporters had invoked the 2000 Bush v. Gore case, in which the Supreme Court cut off Florida recounts and effectively declared then-Gov. George Bush the winner of Florida's decisive electors over then-Vice President Al Gore.

That dispute, arising from a truly tight race and a state-certified 537-vote margin for Bush, worked its way through lower courts and offered grounds that differed dramatically from the Texas effort. Still, Texas warned that the 2020 ""electoral irregularities exceed the hanging-chad saga of the 2000 election"" and ""preclude knowing who legitimately won the 2020 election.""

For the Supreme Court of 2000, Bush v. Gore came down to a difficult 5-4 vote, coincidentally issued 20 years ago on Saturday. Justices on both sides later expressed regret that they were dragged into it.

For the current Supreme Court, considering whether to join the Trump turmoil, it wasn't close."	left

h9rp95	hillaryclinton	Hillary Clinton Backs Eliot Engel, in Her First House Primary Endorsement of 2020	"Hillary Clinton delivered her first Democratic primary endorsement in a 2020 House race on Monday, throwing her support behind Representative Eliot L. Engel of New York, who is trying to fend off a serious challenge from his left after more than three decades in Congress.

“I have worked with Eliot Engel as first lady, as senator from New York and as secretary of state,” Mrs. Clinton said in a statement provided to The New York Times. “Every step of the way, his No. 1 priority has always remained the same: delivering for his constituents.”

The endorsement puts Mrs. Clinton on the opposite side of a wave of progressives who are backing Mr. Engel’s leading challenger, Jamaal Bowman, a middle school principal, including Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont; Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York; the Working Families Party; Justice Democrats; and MoveOn, the progressive advocacy group.

On Tuesday morning, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is being considered by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as a possible running mate, also endorsed Mr. Bowman."	left

Hahn was asked on CNN's ""State of the Union"" to respond to Trump's remarks at the White House on the Fourth of July, when he said that ""99 percent of [cases] are totally harmless.""

""We know that cases are surging in the country,"" Hahn said. ""We've all seen the graphs associated with that, and it's just too early, and I'm not gonna speculate on what the causation is there.""

CNN's Dana Bash pushed the commissioner, saying, ""I can tell you it's not true, and that's obviously not my opinion,"" adding that it is based on estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Bash then asked Hahn whether Trump is ""wrong.""

""I'm not gonna get into who's right and who's wrong,"" he responded. ""What I'm gonna say, Dana, is what I've said before, which is that it's a serious problem that we have. We've seen this surge in cases. We must do something to stem the tide.""

Bash then asked, ""So you won't say whether 99 percent of coronavirus cases are 'completely harmless' is true or false, what the president said at the White House last night?""

""Dana, what I'll say is that we have data in the White House task force,"" Hahn responded. ""Those data show us this is a serious problem. People need to take it seriously.""

During his Independence Day address, Trump seemed to reference a statistic from the CDC this week that the hospitalization rate is 102.5 per 100,000.

COVID-19 cases in the U.S. have been surging in recent weeks in states such as Arizona, California, Texas and Florida. In total, the U.S. has confirmed more than 2.8 million cases with 129,676 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

i76apq	hillaryclinton	100 Years Later, These Activists Continue Their Ancestors’ Work — A new generation of activists traces its ancestry and inspiration to key figures in the suffrage movement.	"Black Lives Matter protesters violently cleared by federal forces from Lafayette Square this June were the latest Americans to bring their demand for justice to the doorstep of a sitting president. The first White House protesters were the suffragists, who amid a world war and a flu pandemic unfurled banners demanding of Woodrow Wilson, “MR. PRESIDENT, HOW LONG MUST WOMEN WAIT FOR LIBERTY?” Shunned, imprisoned, beaten and tortured, the uneasy alliance of white, Black and brown, highly privileged and formerly enslaved women won passage of the 19th Amendment 100 years ago this month using tactics of protest and persuasion that activists still deploy. As Americans mark a century since that struggle, suffragists’ descendants reflect here on the movement’s legacy among Americans of all races, faiths and genders battling for what the suffragists — quoting the president at the time — described as “liberty: the fundamental demand of the human spirit.”

Michelle Duster marvels at how her great-grandmother did it all, juggling research and writing, teaching and speaking. An educator turned journalist, Wells-Barnett’s illustrated accounts of lynchings as an instrument of terror jolted the nation and endangered her life. She was also a founder of the N.A.A.C.P. and a suffragist who demanded voting rights be inseparable from civil rights. Wells-Barnett refused to comply with Alice Paul’s segregation of the 8,000-strong Woman Suffrage Procession in Washington on March 3, 1913, edging into the Illinois contingent as it moved past and marching as the only Black woman in the state delegation. This year Wells-Barnett, who died in 1931, was awarded a posthumous Pulitzer Prize.

“She lived her life on her own terms,” Ms. Duster said.

Born into slavery, Wells-Barnett “could go to the White House and talk to two different presidents,” Ms. Duster said. “But at the same time, she took in people who were practically homeless.”

Ida B. Wells-Barnett

After college, Ms. Duster immersed herself in Wells-Barnett’s life. “I got very interested in the impact of images on people’s worldview,” she said. “I felt like I was experiencing the results of that level of intentional misinformation. That has been the driving force of my whole career — how can I dismantle these false narratives of exactly who African-Americans are?”

Ms. Duster lives in Chicago, where Wells-Barnett settled after a white mob destroyed her Tennessee newspaper office. She teaches writing at Columbia College Chicago and tutors at Wilbur Wright College.

Ms. Duster speaks widely about her great-grandmother’s legacy, a theme explored in her book “Ida B. the Queen: The Extraordinary Life and Legacy of Ida B. Wells.” She is creating an initiative “to educate people about the involvement of Black women in the suffrage movement, and how it ties into today,” she said. Ms. Duster has seen social media posts invoking Wells-Barnett, and an article crediting her with creating a blueprint for opposing police violence. “They’re giving her credit for paving the way, expressing inspiration for how outspoken she was, and willingly and knowingly putting her life in danger,” Ms. Duster said. In addition to exposing lynchings as state-sanctioned murder, “she was encouraging Black people to exercise the power that they did have,” organizing boycotts of white-owned businesses and streetcars and a mass exodus of Black residents from Memphis. “That’s why they wanted to kill her.”

Pamela Swing Anna Plotkin-Swing Granddaughter and Great-granddaughter Betty Gram Swing

Haruka Sakaguchi for The New York Times

From 1917 to 1920, Pamela Swing’s grandmother traveled the country for the National Woman’s Party. Born Myrtle to Danish immigrants, Gram was singing under the stage name Betty on Broadway when the suffrage bug bit. She and her sister Alice hopped a train to Washington in 1917 and joined a protest at the White House demanding President Woodrow Wilson’s support for a federal suffrage amendment.

Photographs in front of the executive mansion capture Betty Gram striking dramatic poses before being sent to the Occoquan Workhouse in Lorton, Va., for the “Night of Terror,” when prison guards severely beat the suffragists. An eight-day hunger strike there weakened Alice so much that Wilson dispatched the White House physician to attend to her. The strike ended with the president’s promise to support the amendment. Betty “emerged from this experience gung-ho,” Ms. Swing said.

She added that she heard her paternal grandmother relate her exploits “until I was almost 16.”

“But it wasn’t until I inherited her papers eight years ago that I started digging around,” said Ms. Swing, who has a Ph.D. in anthropology and folklore. “I found six typewritten pages about a jail experience. No location, no notes, nothing,” she said, adding that about a year later, “I started reading about the Night of Terror. I went back and — oh, my God, she was there.”

Betty Gram Swing

Today, Ms. Swing is a resident scholar at Brandeis’s Women’s Studies Research Center in Waltham, Mass. In 2017, the centennial of the start of the White House demonstration, she organized a re-enactment in Washington.

Ms. Swing’s interest in Black women in the movement stems from the often unsuccessful balance that white movement leaders tried to strike between the demands for universal suffrage and the need to persuade racist legislators to back the amendment. With Elizabeth Dabanka, a Brandeis student from Ghana, Ms. Swing wrote “I Want to Go to Jail,” a play about the last time women were jailed for suffrage that links that struggle with civil rights.

“With what is going on right now, my mind is just exploding with new ideas about working more on the white-Black rift,” Ms. Swing said.

As a child, Anna Plotkin-Swing said that she was into historical fiction, and that “Betty Gram was part of that world of women I had in my head.”

When her mother inherited the suffragist’s papers, they teamed up to save them, “one of us typing and the other one reading aloud.”

“The suffragist movement was pretty pointedly exclusionary of Black women and other women of color,” said Ms. Plotkin-Swing, who is studying at Smith College for a master’s in social work. “They made decisions to exclude those voices and those individuals from their movement because they thought it would detract from their cause.”

Intersectional feminism is “vastly different than what she lived through and identified with,” she said.

“I hope she’d be really excited about that and see the ways Black Lives Matter, prison abolition and immigrant rights all are feminist issues in their own right,” Ms. Plotkin-Swing added.

“Whenever I go to a protest — the Women’s March, Black Lives Matter — that feels like following in her footsteps,” she said. “But I think I’ve taken a different path than she did.”

Susan Whiting Cousin Susan B. Anthony

Haruka Sakaguchi for The New York Times

Growing up, Susan Whiting remembers a stern portrait hanging in her grandmother’s dining room in Lake Geneva, Wis., of her cousin Susan Brownell Anthony, an abolitionist and suffragist. Barely out of her twenties, Anthony teamed up with Elizabeth Cady Stanton to galvanize the suffrage movement. She traveled the nation to promote an unlawful idea; in 1872, she actually was arrested — for voting. Anthony died in 1906 with her goal unrealized, but by then, as she noted, failure was “impossible.”

Entering the working world in the late 1970s, Ms. Whiting learned that her assumptions that “all women were equal” and that “there wasn’t anything I couldn’t do” were more ideals than reality. Still, she was the first female member of a management development program at Nielsen, the global research giant. Over a 35-year career, Ms. Whiting led departments, including the television ratings division. She retired in 2014 as vice chairwoman of the company.

“As I hired people and furthered my career, I was looking for ways to ensure people had equal opportunities, but of course that can be difficult,” she said. “Many, many times when I would run into barriers, I would think of not just her, but all of our ancestors.”

Today, Ms. Whiting leads the board of the National Women’s History Museum, founded by Karen Staser, a researcher and organizational psychologist who noted that there was no museum or research repository devoted to women’s history. One of the organization’s first achievements was an effort in 1997 to position the “Women’s Suffrage Statue,” a.k.a. the “Portrait Monument to Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony,” carved by Adelaide Johnson, in the Capitol Rotunda in Washington. The seven-ton sculpture had been displayed in the basement of the Capitol since its unveiling in 1921.

Susan B. Anthony

The museum has grown into the largest online cultural institution dedicated to American women’s history. It provides lesson plans for teachers and organizes panels on women’s history, the suffrage movement and the life stories of major and minor players.

But the goal had always been to build a physical museum. Ms. Whiting says that could happen soon, and she hopes for an announcement to be made this year.

“We want girls and boys, men and women in the United States to have access to inspiration about the roles women have played and are playing in our history,” she said. “Susan B. Anthony’s story is told, but many others have not been.”

Kenneth B. Morris Jr. Great-great-great-grandson Frederick Douglass

Kayla Reefer for The New York Times

Frederick Douglass, though famed as an abolitionist, attended the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848 and was one of 32 men who signed the Declaration of Sentiments, demanding the vote. In 1866, he joined Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton in founding the American Equal Rights Association, demanding suffrage for all people.

“When I ran away from slavery, it was for myself; when I advocated emancipation, it was for my people,” he said in a speech in 1888 to the International Council of Women in Washington. “But when I stood up for the rights of woman, self was out of the question, and I found a little nobility in the act.”

Growing up, Kenneth B. Morris Jr. spent summers at Twin Oaks, Douglass’s Chesapeake Bay retreat in Highland Beach, Md., an airy home with photographs of his famous ancestors “in every room,” he said.

In 2005, Mr. Morris grew riveted by a National Geographic article on global human trafficking titled, “21st Century Slaves,” as his two daughters, then 12 and 9, got ready for bed.

Mr. Morris, a founder of a marketing firm in Corona, Calif., recalled that he “couldn’t look them in the eyes” as he said goodnight to the girls.

“Frederick Douglass’s goal was to end slavery,” he said. “How could I leverage this platform that I had done nothing with?”

Mr. Morris’s great-great-great-grandfather had written that his lifelong commitment to education was rooted in his enslaver’s rationale for laws criminalizing education for Black Americans: “You cannot teach a slave to read or write because it will unfit him to be a slave.” So in 2007, Mr. Morris co-founded the Frederick Douglass Family Initiatives, “to ‘unfit’ communities to allow slavery to exist and thrive,” he said. “The foundation of all our work is around education,” including how to identify victims of human trafficking. That work has expanded to nearly three dozen counties in California, as well as cities in Utah and Texas.

Frederick Douglass

After the death of George Floyd, a Black man killed in May while in police custody in Minneapolis, and the ensuing explosion of protest, Mr. Morris said: “We started speaking to students, trying to get a sense of where they were. They were filled with anger.” Recalling Douglass’s 1881 essay excoriating racism as a “moral disorder” and “disease,” Mr. Morris developed a youth writing program to explore “remedies for the disease of racism.”

He has also been speaking out to correct another historical wrong: the near-erasure of his great-great-great-grandmother Anna Murray Douglass. A free Black woman, she sold her personal belongings to help finance Douglass’s escape from slavery.

“Had she not been in his life, I don’t know that he would have had the courage to run away,” Mr. Morris said. “I am as much a product of her as I am of him.”

Marguerite Buckman Kearns Granddaughter Edna Buckman Kearns

Adria Malcolm for The New York Times

In 2019, Marguerite Buckman Kearns joined the nationwide Women’s March in her adopted home of New Mexico, holding aloft a poster-size photograph of her grandmother Edna Buckman Kearns, a Quaker suffragist, her grandfather Wilmer Kearns and their daughter Serena. Edna Buckman Kearns, who died in 1934, played a major role in New York’s suffrage campaign while documenting it as a reporter for The Brooklyn Daily Eagle and other newspapers. Wilmer Kearns was her enthusiastic supporter, marching or running the household while his fiery spouse was on the road.

Marguerite Kearns followed her grandmother’s career path, working as a reporter and an editor for The Woodstock Times in Woodstock, N.Y., from its founding in 1972 through the 1980s. In the early ’80s, she documented Pete Seeger’s grass-roots campaign to clean up the Hudson River aboard the sloop Clearwater. The vessel, now a historic landmark, echoes a tactic used by Ms. Kearns’s grandmother, who in the summer of 1913 rode a horse-drawn wagon she christened “Spirit of 1776” throughout Long Island, demanding the vote.

Edna Buckman Kearns

Ms. Kearns learned of her grandmother’s accomplishments from her grandfather, who would haul his wife’s wagon out into his driveway each summer for photographs. “Spirit of 1776” now resides in the New York State Museum in Albany.

Ms. Kearns, retired from the National Education Association, now works to ensure that lesser-known suffragists retain their places in history. They include Adelina Otero-Warren, a revered New Mexico suffragist who became Santa Fe’s first female superintendent of public schools, and Inez Milholland, a National Woman’s Party member who collapsed while speaking in favor of women’s suffrage in Los Angeles. After her death a few weeks later, she was declared a martyr for the cause. Ms. Kearns’s book, “An Unfinished Revolution: Edna Buckman Kearns and the Struggle for Women’s Rights,” will be published in 2021.

“I’m a storyteller for all these generations,” she said.

Joyce Stokes Jones Michele Jones Galvin Great-great- and great-great-great-grandnieces Harriet Tubman

Haruka Sakaguchi for The New York Times

When Michele Jones Galvin was in fourth grade in Syracuse, N.Y., her class was assigned to make a collage depicting a famous person in history. She asked her mother, Joyce Stokes Jones, for an idea. Her mother suggested she choose Aunt Harriet Tubman. Consulting multiple encyclopedias, Ms. Jones Galvin found the same scant sentences, so she chose Sidney Poitier instead.

Soon after, Ms. Jones began filling those historical gaps in the Tubman collage. Over 30 years, she read and researched, traveled and interviewed, learning all she could about Tubman, abolitionist, suffragist and friend of Frederick Douglass, Lucretia Mott and Susan B. Anthony.

Born in 1821 into slavery on a Maryland plantation, according to Ms. Jones’s research, Tubman escaped. Then, through the Underground Railroad, she led slaves to freedom. During the Civil War, Tubman led a spy network for the Union. Though she never learned to read or write, she was a founder of the National Association of Colored Women’s Clubs, prominent advocates for universal suffrage.

Harriet Tubman

Inspired by her research, Ms. Jones began writing a weekly column in 1968 on Black heritage for The Syracuse Herald-Journal and produced programming on Black history for local television. In 1985, she produced a documentary on Tubman’s life and family.

Four decades after embarking on her research, Ms. Jones teamed up with her daughter to write a book. In 2013, on the centennial of Tubman’s death, they published “Beyond the Underground: Aunt Harriet, Moses of Her People.”

“We know Aunt Harriet to be as John Brown described her: ‘The best and the bravest person on the continent,’” Ms. Jones Galvin said. “Her rescue missions, military prowess and support of women’s suffrage speak for themselves.” Ms. Jones Galvin is active in a half-dozen charitable and advocacy groups, including the League of Women Voters.

In mid-March, she was asked what Tubman would think of race relations today. “Aunt Harriet would be heartbroken,” Ms. Jones Galvin said. “She’d be wondering, ‘What the heck have you guys been doing for 107 years after I’m gone?’”

But a month later, after the death of George Floyd, came “the emergence of this new, momentous movement — the people standing up for Black Lives Matter were intergenerational, interracial, a conglomeration of all the best America has to offer,” she said. “I felt we had finally come to the America Aunt Harriet would be proud of.”

Coline Jenkins Great-great-granddaughter Elizabeth Cady Stanton

Haruka Sakaguchi for The New York Times

One story from the early life of Coline Jenkins’s great-great-grandmother Elizabeth Cady Stanton stood out for Ms. Jenkins. Stanton’s father was a judge in Johnstown, N.Y., with an office in the family home on Main Street. Asking about the anguished faces of women who sought his counsel, Stanton learned that marriage erased a woman’s identity, rendering her “civilly dead.” In a fury, Stanton, 10 at the time, tried to slice the relevant statutes from her father’s law books.

One of her father’s clerks, noticing a coral necklace Stanton had gotten as a Christmas gift, once baited her, saying, “‘When you get married, your husband will own it. He can swap your necklace for cigars, and it will go up in smoke,’” Ms. Jenkins said. As an adult, Stanton lobbied the New York legislature, and the state became one of the first to overhaul marital property rights.

Elizabeth Cady Stanton

“She was addressing women’s rights from childhood to her deathbed,” Ms. Jenkins said. With Susan B. Anthony, Stanton — 32 and with a family of her own — helped start the movement that culminated in 1920, nearly two decades after her death, with the ratification of the 19th Amendment.

Ms. Jenkins has that coral necklace now. Her own cause is to ensure that monuments and reminders of the suffragists’ work are all over America.

She is a vice president of Monumental Women, which secured a site in Central Park in New York for the “Women’s Rights Pioneers” monument, portraying Stanton, Anthony and Sojourner Truth. Its unveiling is set for Aug. 26.

Ms. Jenkins lobbied for passage of federal legislation creating a National Votes for Women Trail. With generations of family members, she has donated the Stanton papers, belongings and the original copy of “The Woman’s Bible” — all stored for generations in steamer trunks in the attic of her Greenwich, Conn., home — to institutions across the country. When Ms. Jenkins learned that a collection of 3,000 suffrage campaign mementos was for sale, she bought it: ballots, a fly swatter, a risqué black stocking embroidered with “Votes for Women” that she loans to museums, libraries and the news media.

“To me, this collection reflects the mass movement, the weapons and tools these women used in the world’s greatest bloodless revolution,” she said. “Fifty-one percent of the population gained a legal right, without a gun.”

Jessye Kass Great-great-granddaughter Dora Lewis

Haruka Sakaguchi for The New York Times

Jessye Kass really learned about her great-great-grandmother Dora Lewis during the 2016 presidential campaign, when many women believed they would elect the first female president. Lewis was one of the first members of the National Woman’s Party, founded by Alice Paul and Lucy Burns, and she served in several top roles, including as treasurer. She was arrested during the 1917 protests in Washington and imprisoned in the Occoquan Workhouse in Lorton, Va. During a crackdown at the prison known as the “Night of Terror,” prison guards knocked Lewis unconscious against an iron bedstead. They force-fed her through a tube down her throat when she refused to eat.

Dora Lewis

Ms. Kass has always had a social justice bent. When she was 15, she began volunteering for a domestic violence services network. In college, she ran the Attukwei Art Foundation, a nonprofit providing art therapy to children in Ghana. A Fulbright scholarship in Thailand took her to Urban Light, a group assisting young boys who had been sex trafficked. Returning home to Massachusetts, Ms. Kass worked for an affordable housing program and groups serving underserved and marginalized people.

In 2018, she joined the Cambridge Women’s Center, the oldest such center in the United States. The Cambridge Women’s Center itself sprang from protest: In 1971, a group of women marched from Boston to Cambridge on International Women’s Day and staged a sit-in at a Harvard University building, demanding affordable housing, child care and education for women. With a $5,000 donation from a sympathetic benefactor, Susan Lyman, they bought the house where the center still operates.

“This job most closely connects me to Dora,” Ms. Kass said.

Ms. Kass and Anna Plotkin-Swing, Betty Gram’s great-granddaughter, are childhood friends and recently worked together at the center. There, they realized that not only were their ancestors were allied in the movement, they were close friends.

Rohulamin Quander Carmen Quander Cousins Nellie Quander

Haruka Sakaguchi for The New York Times

The Quanders are one of the Washington region’s largest and most illustrious African-American families. Their presence in North America dates to the late 17th century, and Rohulamin Quander, a family patriarch, says he has found historical suggestions of shared ancestry with a nephew of George Washington’s. Quander descendants include the first Black people to hold leadership roles in education, medicine, commerce and the military, Courtland Milloy reported in 1978 in a column in The Washington Post.

Nellie Quander, an educator and activist for Black women’s rights, taught in Washington public schools while earning her degree at Howard University. She became the president of Alpha Kappa Alpha, an African-American sorority, in 1911, three years after its founding on the campus. In 1913, Quander incorporated the sorority, preserving its founding principles, including high scholastic and ethical standards and service in perpetuity. Alpha Kappa Alpha now has 300,000 members.

Nellie Quander

Quander supported women’s suffrage, and when the National American Woman Suffrage Association announced plans for the Woman Suffrage Procession, spearheaded by Alice Paul and Lucy Burns, in Washington on March 3, 1913, Quander sought entry for Alpha Kappa Alpha. But organizers, acceding to racists in states needed to ratify the 19th Amendment, sought to isolate Black women.

In a letter to Paul, Quander made clear she was having none of it.

On the day of the procession, “Nellie and her group refused to take a place in the back of the D.C. line,” Rohulamin Quander said. “They forcibly integrated themselves into the group of white women from D.C.”

W.E.B. DuBois wrote at the time that “there seems to be no doubt but that the attempt to draw the color line in the woman’s suffrage movement has received a severe and, let us hope, final setback.”

Nellie Quander worked to empower women as a national leader in the Y.W.C.A., where she served for more than 50 years, until her death in 1961.

Much of this history came from Mr. Quander, a Washington lawyer who for more than a half-century has fought as his cousin did to ensure that Black women are not sidelined in the suffrage story. He contributes family history and lends documents to historians, academics and the Library of Congress. His book “Nellie Quander: An Alpha Kappa Alpha Pearl” was published in 2008, the sorority’s centennial year.

“Her family knew Frederick Douglass. Her father was a decorated Civil War veteran. She was an activist until the very end,” Mr. Quander said. “She would be very proud, I think, of the fact that since the 1960s, I have been bringing forth the history of the Quander family.”"	left

j8vfp3	hillaryclinton	A National Security Reckoning: How Washington Should Think About Power [Hillary Clinton in Foreign Affairs]	"In a year marked by plague and protest, Americans are reckoning with long-overdue questions about racial justice, economic inequality, and disparities in health care. The current crisis should also prompt a reckoning about the United States’ national security priorities. The country is dangerously unprepared for a range of threats, not just future pandemics but also an escalating climate crisis and multidimensional challenges from China and Russia. Its industrial and technological strength has atrophied, its vital supply chains are vulnerable, its alliances are frayed, and its government is hollowed out. In the past, it sometimes has taken a dramatic shock—Pearl Harbor, Sputnik, 9/11—to wake up the United States to a new threat and prompt a major pivot. The COVID-19 crisis should be a big enough jolt to rouse the country from its sleep, so that it can summon its strength and meet the challenges ahead.

Among the highest priorities must be to modernize the United States’ defense capabilities—in particular, moving away from costly legacy weapons systems built for a world that no longer exists. Another is to renew the domestic foundations of its national power—supporting American innovation and bolstering strategically important industries and supply chains. These twin projects are mutually reinforcing. Modernizing the military would free up billions of dollars that could be invested at home in advanced manufacturing and R & D. That would not only help the United States compete with its rivals and prepare for nontraditional threats such as climate change and future pandemics; it would also blunt some of the economic pain caused by budget cuts at the Pentagon. Integrating foreign and domestic policy in this way would make both more effective. And it would help the United States regain its footing in an uncertain world.

SHORTSIGHTED

For decades, policymakers have thought too narrowly about national security and failed to internalize—or fund—a broader approach that encompasses threats not just from intercontinental ballistic missiles and insurgencies but also from cyberattacks, viruses, carbon emissions, online propaganda, and shifting supply chains. There is no more poignant example than the current administration’s failure to grasp that a tourist carrying home a virus can be as dangerous as a terrorist planting a pathogen. President Barack Obama’s national security staff left a 69-page playbook for responding to pandemics, but President Donald Trump’s team ignored it, focusing instead on the threat of bioterrorism. They dismantled the National Security Council’s pandemic directorate, folding it into the office responsible for weapons of mass destruction, and filled a national medical stockpile with drugs for anthrax and smallpox while neglecting the personal protective equipment needed for a pandemic. The Trump administration also shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development program created during my time as secretary of state to detect viral threats around the world, and it has repeatedly tried to slash funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The costs of this misjudgment have been astronomical.

The Trump administration has taken a similarly misguided approach to other nontraditional threats. It omitted any reference to climate change in its 2017 National Security Strategy and attempted to block Rod Schoonover, a senior intelligence official, from briefing Congress about it. The administration also deprioritized cyber-espionage in its trade negotiations with China and failed to confront Russia over its interference in U.S. elections. Unsurprisingly, both countries are at it again.

The problem runs much deeper than Trump, however. Administrations of both parties have long underappreciated the security implications of economic policies that weakened strategically important industries and sent vital supply chains overseas. The foreign policy community understandably focused on how new trade agreements would cement alliances and extend American influence in developing countries. Democrats should have been more willing to hit the brakes on new trade agreements when Republicans obstructed efforts to support workers, create jobs, and invest in hard-hit communities at home. When Republicans failed to use trade-enforcement tools to protect American workers—such as the safeguards against unfair surges of Chinese imports that my husband, President Bill Clinton, negotiated but the Bush administration refused to invoke even a single time—and blocked domestic investments in basic research, infrastructure, and clean energy, Democrats should have more forcefully called their intransigence what it was: not just bad economic policy but a national security liability.

The COVID-19 crisis should be a big enough jolt to rouse the country from its sleep.

Myopia about national security also manifests in the simplistic frames applied to complex challenges, such as insisting on seeing competition with China through the lens of the Cold War. In a speech in July, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo offered this pearl of wisdom: “I grew up and served my time in the army during the Cold War. And if there is one thing I learned, Communists almost always lie.” That’s a remarkably unhelpful way of approaching the challenge. Huffing and puffing about Communists may rile up the Fox News audience, but it obscures the fact that China—along with Russia—poses an altogether different threat from the one the Soviet Union did. Today’s competition is not a traditional global military contest of force and firepower. Dusting off the Cold War playbook will do little to prepare the United States for adversaries that use new tools to fight in the gray zone between war and peace, exploit its open Internet and economy to undermine American democracy, and expose the vulnerability of many of its legacy weapons systems. Nor will such an anachronistic approach build the global cooperation needed to take on shared challenges such as climate change and pandemics.

Meanwhile, the United States’ deep domestic fractures have hamstrung its ability to protect itself and its allies. Consider what happened after the Obama administration painstakingly built an international coalition to force Iran to the negotiating table, including winning the reluctant participation of China and Russia, and then secured a historic agreement to stop Iran’s nuclear program. Trump abruptly renounced the agreement. Now, predictably, Iranian centrifuges are spinning, Tehran is exploring a new alliance with Beijing, and the international sanctions regime is shattered. It’s a frustrating, self-inflicted wound and a reminder of the costs of inconstancy.

The problem is not always too much change; in some areas, it’s too little. The overmilitarization of U.S. foreign policy is a bad habit that goes all the way back to the days when President Dwight Eisenhower warned of “the military-industrial complex.” Many generals understand what James Mattis told Congress when he led U.S. Central Command: “If you don’t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition ultimately.” But many politicians are too afraid of being attacked as soft on defense to listen. So they pile mission after mission on the Pentagon and authorize ballooning military budgets while starving civilian agencies. And, it’s important to emphasize, for decades, right-wing ideological resistance has blocked crucial investments in American diplomacy and development abroad and American innovation at home—from foreign aid budgets to domestic infrastructure and R & D spending.

THE OBSTACLES TO MODERNIZATION

Like the broader government, the military itself can be slow to adapt to new threats. After the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, there were fatal delays in getting up-armored Humvees and lifesaving body armor to troops in the field. Now, the Pentagon is again at risk of being caught unprepared for the very different demands of competing with China. I saw how hard it can be to move a bureaucracy as sprawling as the Pentagon when, in 2004, I was asked to be the only U.S. senator on the Joint Forces Command’s Transformation Advisory Group, which was charged with helping the military reimagine itself for the twenty-first century. The Defense Department had assembled an impressive team of military and civilian experts from a range of disciplines and told them to think as big and boldly as possible, yet our efforts to recommend reforms ran into some of the same obstacles that remain today. Powerful players in the Pentagon, Congress, and the private sector have built careers—and, in some cases, fortunes—doing things a certain way. They have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo.

To be sure, when lives are on the line, it can be more prudent to rely on proven practices than untested innovations. And decisions about military posture and procurement have profound economic and political implications that should not be overlooked. As a senator, I represented many New York communities dependent on defense jobs, and I did everything I could to keep bases open and factories humming, whether it was funding the production of new howitzer tubes at the Watervliet Arsenal and the development of advanced radar systems on Long Island or bolstering the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum. I knew how much the jobs meant for my constituents, and I was convinced that each of the appropriations had national security merit. Yet multiply that dynamic across 50 states and 435 congressional districts, and it becomes clear why it’s so hard to retire aging weapons systems or close bases that have outlived their usefulness.

Today, the poster child for this political reality is the F-35 fighter. Development of the plane ran way behind schedule and over budget, and it is estimated to cost $1 trillion over its lifespan, yet it is considered untouchable. The air force sank so much time and money into the project that turning back became unthinkable, especially since the F-35 is the only fifth-generation aircraft currently being manufactured in the United States. And because the plane directly and indirectly supports hundreds of thousands of jobs across hundreds of congressional districts in nearly every state, it has legions of defenders in Congress.

A SMARTER DEFENSE BUDGET

These obstacles to reforming the military are not new, but they are newly urgent. The Pentagon must adapt to a strategic landscape far different from the one it faced during the Cold War or the war on terrorism. New technologies such as artificial intelligence are rendering old systems obsolete and creating opportunities that no country has yet mastered but many are seeking. Then there are the particularly thorny challenges in East Asia. While the American military was fighting costly land wars in the Middle East, China was investing in relatively cheap anti-access/area-denial weapons, such as antiship ballistic missiles, which pose credible threats to the United States’ expensive aircraft carriers.

No one should make the mistake of believing that the People’s Liberation Army is ten feet tall or that the competition with China is primarily a military contest. China has relied on financial coercion and economic statecraft to gain influence as it builds infrastructure around the world. In recent years, while the Trump administration was gutting the State Department and undermining U.S. alliances in Asia and Europe, China was doubling its diplomacy budget and pouring untold billions into developing countries, now outstripping American aid. China today has more diplomatic posts around the world than the United States does.

That said, the military challenge from China is real. The United States should not be lulled into a false sense of security by its continuing firepower advantage or the fact that its defense budget remains orders of magnitude larger than Beijing’s. China’s advances mean that the United States’ air and sea superiority in the region is no longer ensured. This isn’t competition from a military equal but a new kind of asymmetric threat. Americans learned in the sands of Afghanistan and Iraq that asymmetry can be deadly, and the same is true in the skies and seas of East Asia. To make matters worse, the United States must meet this challenge with a military that has been damaged by Trump’s mismanagement. He has degraded civilian oversight of the Pentagon by leaving scores of key posts vacant. At the same time, he has attempted to turn the military into part of his political machine—pardoning war criminals over the objections of military leaders and deploying National Guard troops in Lafayette Square so that he could stage a photo op.

Modernizing and refocusing the military will take both vision and backbone. A big part of the effort will have to involve overhauling the defense budget. Deep savings—potentially hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade—can and should be found by retiring legacy weapons systems. But choices about where to cut and where to spend must be driven by a clear-eyed analysis of national security needs, not politics. The United States can’t afford to repeat the mistakes of the 2013 budget sequestration, when Congress forced the Pentagon to slash budgets indiscriminately, with no overarching strategy. This work is going to require a president and a secretary of defense who are rigorous in their analysis and comfortable consulting with Congress and the military brass but prepared to make difficult decisions about which missions to prioritize and which to de-emphasize or eliminate. To insulate these decisions from political pressure, Congress should agree to take an up-or-down vote on a comprehensive package of defense reforms—a process that has been used in the past for closing military bases—rather than haggling over each adjustment.

Changes to the budget should aim to prepare the United States for asymmetric conflict with technologically advanced adversaries. For example, aircraft carriers still play an important role in U.S. power projection around the world but are vulnerable to Chinese antiship missiles, which cost a fraction of the price. In addition, only a handful of the U.S. Navy’s 11 aircraft carriers are usually operational and at sea at any given time, with onerous maintenance keeping others in port. Instead of continuing to expand the fleet of vulnerable surface ships, the navy should invest in accelerated maintenance and next-generation submarines. Similarly, as anti-access/area-denial weapons force U.S. aircraft carriers and guided-missile cruisers to stay farther away from potential targets, the U.S. Air Force will have to focus less on short-range tactical fighter planes and more on long-range capabilities. That means it won’t need nearly as many F-35s as planned, but it should welcome the arrival of the B-21 Raider, a long-range bomber under development that is designed to thwart advanced air defenses. These capabilities must be accompanied by mechanisms that allow for consultation with China and Russia to reduce the chances that a long-range conventional attack is mistaken for a nuclear strike, which could lead to disastrous escalation.

As the United States leaves behind a period dominated by land wars and looks ahead to potential air, sea, and space conflicts, the army should accept the risks that come with a smaller active-duty ground force. A force with fewer soldiers and heavy tanks would match the strategic moment and cost far less. Maintaining fewer active-component armored brigade combat teams, for example, could save tens of billions of dollars over the next decade. Instead of heavy tanks, the military should be investing in tools that will give troops an edge in the conflicts of the future, including upgraded communications and intelligence systems.

Modernizing and refocusing the military will take both vision and backbone.

Perhaps most important, the United States needs a new approach to nuclear weapons. For starters, it should not be deploying low-yield nuclear warheads on submarines or nuclear-armed cruise missiles, which expand the range of scenarios for the use of nuclear weapons and increase the risk of a misunderstanding escalating quickly into a full-blown nuclear exchange. Nor should the United States spend $1 trillion over the next 30 years on its nuclear arsenal, as is currently planned. Instead, it should significantly reduce its reliance on old intercontinental ballistic missiles, pursue a “newer and fewer” approach to modernization, and revive the arms control diplomacy that the Trump administration scrapped. A top priority should be to extend the New START treaty with Russia, which Ellen Tauscher, the State Department’s top arms control official, and I helped negotiate at the beginning of the Obama administration. It will also be important to persuade China to join nuclear negotiations.

A renewed commitment to diplomacy would strengthen the United States’ military position. U.S. alliances are an asset that neither China nor Russia can match, allowing Washington to project force around the world. When I was secretary of state, for example, we secured an agreement to base 2,500 U.S. marines in northern Australia, near the contested sea-lanes of the South China Sea. Yet Trump treats the U.S. alliance system as nothing more than a protection racket—for example, warning NATO partners that they must “either pay the United States for its great military protection, or protect themselves.” Although it’s appropriate to emphasize the need for burden sharing, it is more constructive to think of a division of labor. As the United States focuses on modernizing its air and sea capabilities, it will make sense for other NATO members to concentrate on strengthening their conventional ground forces so that they can deter incursions in eastern Europe or lead counterterrorism missions in Africa.

REBUILDING SELF-SUFFICIENCY

That is how the United States should modernize its approach to defense—one of the three Ds, along with diplomacy and development, that for more than a decade I have said should be integrated as part of a “smart power” strategy. Now, it’s time to add a fourth D: domestic renewal, the rebuilding of the country’s industrial and technological strength.

The United States’ dwindling industrial capacity and inadequate investment in scientific research leave the country dangerously dependent on China and unprepared for future crises. The problem goes back decades. When the USS Cole was bombed in 2000, I was shocked to learn that there was only one American company left that manufactured the specialized steel needed to repair the ship’s hull. Twenty years later, the pandemic has underscored how much the United States relies on China and other countries for vital imports—not just lifesaving medical supplies but also raw materials such as rare-earth minerals and electronic equipment that powers everything from telecommunications to weapons systems.

The United States should pursue a plan like the one proposed by former Vice President Joe Biden to invest $700 billion in innovation and manufacturing and impose stronger “Buy American” provisions, with the goal of jump-starting domestic production in key sectors—from steel to robotics to biotechnology—reshoring sensitive supply chains, and expanding strategic stockpiles of essential goods. It’s time for ambitious industrial policies. China does whatever it can to gain an advantage, including conducting industrial espionage on a massive scale, pursuing a range of unfair trade practices, and providing virtually unlimited resources to state-owned and state-backed enterprises. The United States doesn’t need to cheat or steal, but it can’t afford to compete with one hand tied behind its back.

The United States can’t afford to compete with one hand tied behind its back.

Although it is a mistake to use national security as a catchall justification for blanket protectionist trade policies, as Trump has done, policymakers should widen the range of industries and resources deemed vital to it. It’s not enough anymore to prioritize materials and technologies used for weapons systems and semiconductors; the United States’ security also depends on the control of pharmaceuticals, clean energy, 5G networks, and artificial intelligence. That’s one reason it’s crucial to reverse the long-term decline in the federal share of spending on R & D. Another reason is that investments in basic science and medical research can yield huge economic gains: economists at MIT have estimated that increasing federal funding for research in the United States by 0.5 percent of GDP, or about $100 billion per year, would create some four million jobs.

Massive new investments in advanced manufacturing and R & D will be expensive, but they are necessary for the United States’ long-term economic and security interests and will pay off for years to come. Critics will no doubt warn that running up the national debt is itself a national security risk. But at a time of historically low real interest rates and historically high unemployment, the country should not shy away from bold investments. There is a growing consensus among economists that Washington need not be paralyzed by fears of debt and that it can afford to spend heavily on critical national investments that bring high returns, especially during a crisis. Indeed, what the United States cannot afford is to defer these investments any longer.

AN INTEGRATED APPROACH

These two agendas—military modernization and domestic renewal—should be integrated. Moving away from outdated weapons systems will cause economic disruption and real hardship. That’s why it should be done in tandem with targeted investments in economically struggling communities, bringing advanced manufacturing and R & D to the places most affected by defense cuts. In fact, as a study by economists at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, has found, $1 billion spent on clean energy, health care, or education creates, on average, far more jobs than the same amount of military spending.

I’m not suggesting telling laid-off factory workers to reinvent themselves as coders; that’s fanciful and condescending. Previous pledges to support workers who lost their jobs because of defense cuts or trade policies have often fallen abysmally short. But the U.S. government can do more to help displaced workers and those leaving the military transition to the millions of new jobs that could be created through major new domestic investments. In 2008, when the U.S. Air Force retired the F-16s based at Hancock Field Air National Guard Base, in Syracuse, New York, I helped secure funding to turn the base into one of the military’s first major drone bases, saving hundreds of jobs. American history is full of examples of factories, communities, and entire industries pivoting when they had to. During World War II, the auto industry shifted gears with incredible speed to make tanks and bombers. At the beginning of the pandemic, it shifted swiftly again, to produce desperately needed ventilators and personal protective equipment. With the right long-term investments, communities can reinvent themselves successfully. Pittsburgh, once a center of steel production, has become a hub for health care, robotics, and research on autonomous vehicles.

Many legacy weapons systems are built or based in communities with skilled workforces that can and should be the backbone of the country’s renewed self-sufficiency. Think of Syracuse, which has long been a center of defense manufacturing, a bright spot in an otherwise difficult economic picture. In 2017, the Brookings Institution ranked Syracuse dead last for economic growth out of 100 U.S. metro areas, so it could ill afford to lose any of the defense jobs keeping the region afloat. Yet a 2019 ranking by a pair of MIT economists put the city as the third most promising technology hub in the country, thanks to its skilled workers and low cost of living. It’s exactly the kind of place where significant public investments in advanced manufacturing, clean energy, and R & D could create good jobs and help the United States outcompete China.

Washington need not be paralyzed by fears of debt.

So is Lima, Ohio. Hundreds of people work at the city’s Abrams tank factory. Even though General Ray Odierno, then chief of staff of the U.S. Army, told legislators in 2012, “We don’t need the tanks,” Congress kept the factory open. It’s true that the plant’s workers and their community have devoted themselves to protecting the United States, and the country absolutely must keep faith with them. It’s also true that the military still doesn’t need the tanks. But if the United States is to get serious about climate change, what it does need are more factories to churn out clean electric vehicles. The Pentagon alone should replace most of its fleet of 200,000 nontactical vehicles with electric. Some of those new vehicles could be built in Lima, which is already home to a large Ford engine factory. And that’s just one possibility. If Washington decides to boost domestic production of next-generation electric batteries, wind turbines, and other strategically significant products, Northwest Ohio is a natural place to do it.

No one should pretend that every defense job can be saved or replaced. Cutting hundreds of billions of dollars in military spending over the next decade will inevitably inflict a painful toll on families and communities across the country. But if the government can pair these cuts with major new investments in affected communities, it can minimize the economic damage and maximize the United States’ ability to compete with China and prepare for future challenges.

All of this requires leadership from the top. Having a commander in chief with no experience—and no empathy or vision—has been a disaster. But it’s hard to imagine a man better suited to lead the work ahead than Biden, a former chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who has deep expertise in national security policy, a military father who knows how much the country owes its men and women in uniform and their families, and a champion of working people who fought to save the auto industry when others would have let it go bankrupt.

In the throes of a crisis as dire as any the United States has seen in many decades, it can be difficult to imagine what the world will look like in four months, let alone four years. But the country needs to be thinking now about the threats it will face in a post-pandemic future, as well as the opportunities it must seize. As former Secretary of State Dean Acheson recounted in his memoirs, when George Marshall led the State Department, he urged his team to look ahead, “not into the distant future, but beyond the vision of the operating officers caught in the smoke and crises of current battle; far enough ahead to see the emerging form of things to come.” The United States should endeavor to do the same today. To look beyond the current battle and prepare to lead the post-COVID world, it must broaden its approach to national security and renew the foundations of its national power."	left

grjz5p	hillaryclinton	Hillary Clinton throws weight behind Rocah in Westchester DA's Democratic primary race	"Hillary Clinton throws weight behind Rocah in Westchester DA's Democratic primary race

Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has waded into the Westchester County district attorney's race, encouraging voters to back former prosecutor and TV analyst Mimi Rocah in her bid to take out incumbent Anthony Scarpino Jr. in an upcoming primary.

With the Democratic primary less than a month away, Clinton voiced support for Rocah, but didn't officially endorse her, during a virtual rally for female candidates on Friday. Rocah is challenging Scarpino, who is completing his first term, to be the top law enforcement officer in the county. The primary is June 23.

Clinton, the former First Lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state, detailed Rocah's career as a prosecutor, including her work as chief of the Justice Department’s Westchester division.

DISTRICT ATTORNEY RACE: Rocah continues to outraise Scarpino in Westchester race

Clinton, who lives in Chappaqua, said Rocah has spoken ""truth to power"" during her numerous cable television appearances since the election of President Donald Trump.

""If you’re looking for somebody who has good ideas to fix our criminal justice system to make it fair, equitable, efficient and productive and do the job it's supposed to be... I'm thrilled to lend my voice to all those that are supporting Mimi in this race,"" Clinton said. ""We have a lot of work to do to make sure she gets her message out, people get to know her, they understand why she'd be a great district attorney.""

She didn't mention Scarpino, a former state Supreme Court judge and county Surrogate Court judge.

The brief speech by Clinton was part of a virtual event organized by several groups that support women running for office and was hosted by ex-television host Rosie O'Donnell.

COMMITTEE NOD: Democrats pick Anthony Scarpino for DA in close vote over Mimi Rocah

BACK AND FORTH: MSNBC's Mimi Rocah and Westchester DA Anthony Scarpino trade charges as race heats up

DEBATE: Democrats in Westchester District Attorney primary to square off in online forum

Rocah, in a statement, called it an honor to have Clinton's backing.

""The Trump Administration has harmed our community — and it is up to local leaders to push back and help repair the damage it has caused,"" Rocah said.

Scarpino's campaign didn't address Clinton's snub in a statement to The Journal News/lohud.com. Scarpino narrowly nailed down the county Democratic committee's nod earlier this year.

“District Attorney Scarpino is proud of his service over the last three years, enacting progressive reforms, making Westchester a safer place and leading the office through this unprecedented crisis,"" a Scarpino spokesperson said. ""This is a strong record to run on and we are confident that Westchester Democrats will agree on Election Day.”

A spokesperson for Rocah said while the show of support from Clinton wasn't an official endorsement, ""it's virtually and pretty much an endorsement.""

Rocah and Clinton met at the nascent stages of Rocah's campaign in February, the spokesperson said. The two also met in 2016 when Clinton was running for president.

""It was just kind of this really organic, effusive show of support at this event that we weren't expecting,"" the spokesperson said.

l90eht	hillaryclinton	After Record Turnout, Republicans Are Trying to Make It Harder to Vote	"Bills in Arizona, Mississippi and Wisconsin would end the practice of awarding all electoral votes to the presidential candidate who wins the statewide vote. Instead, they would be allotted according to votes in congressional districts — which in Republican states are generally gerrymandered to favor Republicans. In Arizona, the Legislature also would choose two electors.

In the last election, the moves would have reduced Mr. Biden’s electoral vote total by 11 votes.

Nebraska, on the other hand, would do the reverse with a similar partisan outcome: The state now awards presidential electors by congressional district, but legislation would move the state to the winner-take-all system. One of Nebraska’s three House districts voted for Mr. Biden in November.

The Battle Over Voting Rights Amid months of false claims by former President Donald J. Trump that the 2020 election was stolen from him, Republican lawmakers in many states are marching ahead to pass laws making it harder to vote and changing how elections are run, frustrating Democrats and even some election officials in their own party. A Key Topic : The rules and procedures of elections have become a central issue in American politics. The Brennan Center for Justice, a liberal-leaning law and justice institute at New York University, counts 361 bills in 47 states that seek to tighten voting rules. At the same time, 843 bills have been introduced with provisions to improve access to voting. The Basic Measures: The restrictions vary by state but can include limiting the use of ballot drop boxes, adding identification requirements for voters requesting absentee ballots, and doing away with local laws that allow automatic registration for absentee voting. More Extreme Measures: Some measures go beyond altering how one votes, including tweaking Electoral College and judicial election rules, clamping down on citizen-led ballot initiatives, and outlawing private donations that provide resources for administering elections. Pushback: This Republican effort has led Democrats in Congress to find a way to pass federal voting laws. A sweeping voting rights bill passed the House in March, but faces difficult obstacles in the Senate. Republicans have remained united against the proposal and even if the bill became law, it would likely face steep legal challenges. Florida: The latest state to restrict voting. Measures include limiting the use of drop boxes, adding more identification requirements for absentee ballots, requiring voters to request an absentee ballot for each election, limiting who could collect and drop off ballots, and further empowering partisan observers during the ballot-counting process. Texas: The next big move could happen here, where Republicans in the legislature are brushing aside objections from corporate titans and moving on a vast election bill that would be among the most severe in the nation. It would impose new restrictions on early voting, ban drive-through voting, threaten election officials with harsher penalties and greatly empower partisan poll watchers. Other States: Georgia Republicans in March enacted far-reaching new voting laws that limit ballot drop-boxes and make the distribution of water within certain boundaries of a polling station a misdemeanor. Iowa has also imposed new limits, including reducing the period for early voting and in-person voting hours on Election Day. And bills to restrict voting have been moving through Republican-led legislatures in Arizona and Michigan.



Even Republicans in states where the November election was not close are proposing to tighten voting laws. In Texas, a state with perhaps the nation’s strictest voting rules and one of the lowest levels of turnout, the state party has declared “election integrity” the top legislative priority. Among other proposals, legislators want to cut the time allotted for early voting, limit outsiders’ ability to help voters fill out ballots and require new voters to prove they are citizens.

Republicans who control the Pennsylvania Legislature have mounted one of the most aggressive campaigns, even though any laws they enact probably would have to weather a veto by the state’s Democratic governor.

A handful of Republican state lawmakers want to abolish no-excuse absentee voting only 15 months after the Legislature approved it in an election-law package backed by all but two of its 134 G.O.P. members who cast votes. The main supporter of the bill, State Senator Doug Mastriano, has claimed that Mr. Biden’s victory in the state is illegitimate, and spent thousands of dollars to bus protesters to the Jan. 6 demonstration that ended in the assault on the Capitol.

Rolling back the law appears a long shot. But there seems to be strong Republican support for other measures, including eliminating drop boxes for absentee ballots, discarding mail-in ballots with technical errors and ending a grace period for receiving ballots mailed by Election Day.

State Representative Seth Grove, the Republican chair of the committee holding 14 hearings into election practices, said at the initial gathering on Jan. 21 that he was not interested in dwelling on the 2020 election. “We want a better process going forward, and we’re committed to that,’’ Mr. Grove said."	left

jiieo8	hillaryclinton	“Thought of Trump 2nd term literally makes me sick” girl me too!	"Wyatte Grantham-Philips | USA TODAY

USA TODAY

In a podcast released Monday, former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said the thought of a second term with President Donald Trump makes her ""literally sick to my stomach.""

""I can't entertain the idea of him winning, so let's just preface it by that,"" Clinton told Kara Swisher, as a guest on Swisher's New York Times Opinion podcast.

""It makes me literally sick to my stomach to think that we'd have four more years of this abuse and destruction of our institutions, and damaging of our norms and our values, and lessening of our leadership... The list goes on,"" she said.

In a 42-minute conversation, the two also discussed the 2016 presidential election, shifts seen among voters over the past four years and the persisting challenges of being a woman in politics.

Clinton's dislike of the President isn't one-sided. Trump continues to criticize Clinton and refer to her as ""Crooked,"" as in an Oct. 17 tweet.

""Joe Biden is a corrupt politician — and the Biden family is a criminal enterprise,"" he wrote. ""This makes Crooked Hillary Clinton look like amateur hour!""

This election year, Clinton has endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.). She's helped raise millions for the campaign and has vocalized her support on social media.

Clinton has urged her followers to vote early, and cast their ballots for Biden-Harris — most recently, in a Monday post that also marked her birthday.

""It's my birthday. Here's my one wish: that you reach out to one person in your life who may not vote this year and encourage them to turn out for Biden-Harris,"" Clinton wrote on Instagram. ""All of us have more power than we know.""

In April, Biden referred to Clinton as ""a woman who should be President of the United States right now"" and said he wished he was campaigning for her re-election instead.

jgpdi2	hillaryclinton	The Unemployment Rate in U.S. States from 1980 to September 2020 - Statistics and Data	"What was the impact of the Coronavirus on the American economy? What is the trend of the employment rate in the different States of the U.S.? In this new analysis some tables, videos and graphs that show the trend of the labor market in the last 30 years.

The evolution of the unemployment rate in the U.S.

The darker the color of the individual states (red and then black) the higher the unemployment rate of the individual state. The two most difficult moments of the last 30 years in the United States of America are definitely 2. The financial crisis of 2008 and the Covid-19. In January 2010 for example the unemployment rate in California was 12.2%. In MIchigan it was 13.9% and in Nevada it was 13%. Worst figures in the history of the last 30 years are not seen except during Covid-19. In fact, in May 2020 Nevada reached an unemployment rate of 25.3%. In Michigan it reached 21.3% and in California, the largest state, 16.4%.

The video with Bar Chart and map of the evolution of the unemployment rate in the U.S. On the left the map with all the States. On the right the 15 States with the highest unemployment rate.

The Unemployment Rate in U.S. States.

The interactive map of all U.S. states by unemployment rate. The more the color tends towards red and black, the higher the unemployment rate.

The impact of Covid-19 on the unemployment rate in America

If we compare the unemployment rate in 2020 to 2019, the rate has increased in all countries.

The peak of variation was on the island of Hawaii. In just 12 months it went from a rate of 2.7 to 15.10. Hawaii is the state that has had the biggest gap in this time. Among the three nations with the biggest gap are Nevada and California. Nevada grew by 8.90 and California by 7.10 from 3.90 to 11.00.

Between these states it is to say however that Puerto Rico had an unemployment rate above average with 7.90. The growth was in this case “only” 0.50 additional points.

het6oc	hillaryclinton	"Hillary Clinton, in conversation with Amy Schumer, talks about George Floyd, Black Lives Matter and ""retiring"" Donald Trump"	"Amy Schumer had a message for Hillary Clinton.

On the day after the 2016 election, the “Trainwreck” actor and comedian took to her Instagram account to express her rage at the millions of Americans who had supported Donald Trump. “People who voted for him, you are weak. You’re not just misinformed, you didn’t attempt information,” Schumer wrote online. “Well, you’ve gotten what you asked for. And now you can watch the sky open up, literally.”

“Wow, who said that?” Clinton asked, when presented with the quote.

“That’s me,” Schumer responded.

For nearly an hour, Schumer and Clinton spoke over Zoom during a conversation for Variety’s Virtual TV Festival, which streamed on Variety.com this week. What brought them together was a common experience: Both Clinton and Schumer are the subjects of recent documentaries about their careers and lives as trailblazing feminists.

In “Hillary,” now playing on Hulu, director Nanette Burstein mines 1,700 hours of unseen footage from the 2016 campaign and more than 35 hours of new interviews with Clinton to explore the politician and the person behind the pantsuit.

And in “Expecting Amy,” coming to HBO Max on Joy 9, director Alexander Hammer chronicles Schumer’s life on the road as a comedian who is navigating her first pregnancy

The former Secretary of State and First Lady spoke from her home in Chappaqua, N.Y., while Schumer was isolating with her family on Martha’s Vineyard. There were moments of levity in the interview as Schumer asked Clinton if she was a good sleeper. “I’ve always been a really good sleeper,” Clinton said.

What would Clinton’s last meal be? “Oh, brother,” Clinton said. “Probably a fully loaded deep dish pizza.”

In her spare time, Clinton said she was catching up on the TV series “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.” “I love all the 1950s and ’40s looks, and the clothes,” Clinton said. “Do you relate to her character at all, and the stand-up?”

“I like to think that I’m funnier than her,” Schumer said about the title character played by Rachel Brosnahan.

But beyond these lighter moments, Clinton’s conversation with Schumer was rooted in the current reality — of ongoing racism in the United States and the sexism that led to Trump’s surprise victory.

“It was such an emotional gut punch,” Clinton said of how she felt when she learned of the results of the election. “I didn’t think I was going to lose. But I felt a sense of real responsibility, like how did this happen? Of course, I was really worried about Trump. But he’s been worse than I even feared he would be, and as I tried to warn people he would be.”

Clinton also spoke about the health, civil rights and economic crises associated with Trump’s presidency. “We’re seeing that play out dramatically right now between COVID, and the economy, and the terrible decisions he made around peaceful protestors, and trying to send in the military — and so much that is contrary to the Constitution, to our fundamental values to humanity,” Clinton said. “So, I have carried with me this real sense of deep responsibility that, ‘Oh, my gosh, I just can’t bear the fact this man became president.’ For whatever combination of reasons, and there were a lot of reasons, I win a popular vote and lose the electoral college by literally a handful.”

Clinton vowed that she was determined to help Joe Biden defeat Trump in the upcoming November election. “I’m spending most of my time trying to do everything I can to retire him, and to send him back to the golf course full-time,” Clinton said.

She continued: “This protest that is going on” — in response to George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police officers — “it really is a kind of moment of moral reckoning,” Clinton said, noting that people could no longer ignore images of police brutality shot on iPhones. “They can’t turn away from that eight-minute-and-46-second video. They can’t turn away from the look on that policeman’s face where he just literally shifted his body and put his hand in [his] pocket and put greater pressure on Mr. Floyd’s neck. Because they can’t look away, they have to come to grips with what has gone on.”

Clinton told Schumer she believed that there have been changes in the dialogue about racism that exists in the United States. “Black Lives Matter was considered a kind of radical statement a few years ago,” Clinton said. “I remember I was criticized, I was attacked online, for using it. And I get it, and now we’re at a different point because people’s awareness, consciousness and actual events that they now see on their phones has changed the debate.”

Schumer said that in the few times she’s spent with Clinton, she’s been shocked by the way that people have treated her.

“One time I got to sit next to you at your birthday, and one time we were at this awards show,” Schumer said. “It was before you had announced your run, but everybody kind of thought you were probably going to run. The host of this show came out, and it was this guy, and he did a whole thing where he was singing to you, and trying to seduce you, and he sat on your lap. And I’m like, ‘This is so inappropriate. This is probably the next president of our country.’”

Clinton told Schumer that, throughout her campaign, she’d saw that voters would respond to her differently based on their own biases about women.

“I really did feel that I was this walking Rorschach test,” Clinton said. “That people would project onto me all kinds of feelings and experiences in their own lives. Obviously, it was most apparent around my decision to stay in my marriage, which was a very painful, personal challenge. We talked, obviously, quite a bit about [that] in the documentary, and it was not easy. I felt like I was making, at the end of the day, the right decision for me, my family. And therefore, I was very much at peace with that.”

Schumer said that for as long as she could remember, she’d always looked up to Clinton as a role model. “When I was a little girl,” Schumer said, “if somebody told me I was going to someday Zoom with Hillary, I don’t know what that would’ve meant, but I would’ve known it was special.”"	left

gqw3pz	hillaryclinton	BTRTN: Hey, Joe Biden... Here's How To Turn Your V.P. Dilemma Into a Big Win	"President Biden's Approval Rating for the week ending May 1, 2021 increased by +1 percentage point versus the prior week, from 53% to 54%.





With a disapproval level of only 4o%, Biden's net approval is +14, slightly up versus the week before (+12), and down from +21 at the time of his inauguration.





Biden's weekly approval rating has not gone below 50% yet in his presidency. His predecessor never achieved the 50% level -- even once.





Biden will try to keep his approval rating at 50% or higher to increase his prospects for reelection. Only one President had an approval rating under 50% and won reelection, George W. Bush in 2004, who had an approval rating of 48%. (This is covering all presidents from Truman forward, when polling to measure approval ratings was first undertaken.)

jff68p	hillaryclinton	Planned Parenthood Action: 5 Issues to Watch in the 2020 Election	"1. Abortion Access

For years, anti-abortion politicians in the Trump-Pence administration and elsewhere have fought to pack the federal courts, misinform voters, and undercut the political power of populations that support abortion rights. Their schemes have yielded results; in 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear arguments in a case which could make the protections of Roe v. Wade virtually meaningless, taking the country one step closer to making abortion impossible to access.

But abortion opponents who proclaim the fight for reproductive rights a lost cause could hardly be more wrong. More than three-quarters of voters support say abortion should remain safe and legal — and at the polls in 2018 and 2019 they made their wishes clear, electing champions for reproductive rights down the ballot.

As anti-abortion politicians fall increasingly out of step with the American public — passing state laws that attempt to ban abortion at a point before most people know they’re pregnant, or even outright, despite there being no state in which banning abortion is popular — we’re ready to sustain the unstoppable grassroots momentum to protect reproductive freedom, and to prove that access to health care, including safe, legal abortion, remains a winning issue for candidates."	left

jj3nmi	hillaryclinton	[OC] States in U.S. with more Covid Cases per 100,000 people - Statistics and Data	"In recent weeks we have seen and read many graphs. Many of them talk about the absolute data of Covid-19. In this new in-depth study we will try to see the cases of Covid-19 for every 100 thousand inhabitants. A different way to see the data and understand where the Covid-19 cases are more based on the population. States in U.S. with more Covid Cases per 100000 people.

States in the U.S. with the highest number of cases every 100 thousand inhabitants

The 3 states by total number of Covid-19 cases in the U.S. are Texas, California and Florida. Texas is the state with the highest total number of cases, 917,000 followed by California with 914,000. In third place is Florida with 782,000. However, if we look at the 15 states of the U.S. with more cases per 100,000 inhabitants, the situation changes. Among the first 15, in fact, there is only Florida with a figure as of 26 October of 3555.74 cases per 100 thousand inhabitants. At the top of this statistic are North Dakota, South Dakota and Louisiana. North Dakota has more than 5000 cases of Covid-19 per 100 thousand inhabitants. South Dakota follows with 4400 and Louisiana with 3876.47. Florida which has, as we have seen, many total cases is eighth with 3555.74.

The map with all states for cases of Covid-19 every 100 thousand inhabitants

The evolution of Coronavirus cases per 100 thousand inhabitants is also interesting to see through the map below. As of October 26, the states colored black or tending to black are those in the chart above. However, it is interesting to note that the worsening of the cases has been constant and that today there are very few states with few cases, even per 100 thousand inhabitants. If until the first weeks the Covid-19 was located in the eastern part of the U.S. with the time it has developed in all the United States of America.

Data on Covid-19 in the U.S. updated to October 26th

But how many cases in total are there of Covid-19 in the USA? And how are they distributed among the different States?

The number of total cases in the U.S. is almost 9 million. Of these 231,129 are the victims since the beginning of the pandemic. The active cases in total to date are almost 3 million while the recovered are almost 6 million.

In the table below you can see the number of cases per state and per number of deaths. As we said Texas, California and Florida are the first 3 states for confirmed cases. These states are followed by Florida, New York and Illinois. Different discourse for deaths. The first state is New York with 33,523 followed by Texas with 17786. In third place is Caliofrnia with 17194 victims from Covid-19. The explanation of this diversity from total cases and victims can be explained as follows. New York was one of the first states to be hit by the pandemic. In a time of difficulty and novelty of the virus, it is possible that the way patients are treated has changed and improved over time.

Hillary Clinton Reveals Her New 'Catch Phrase' — and It's the Title of Her Intimate New Podcast

Hillary Clinton is opening up in a new way — from the cozy, book-filled attic in her Chappaqua, N.Y., home — and she's not just talking politics.

The 2016 Democratic nominee for President is launching her first podcast on September 29 in partnership with iHeartRadio. The 24-episode show, You and Me Both with Hillary Clinton, takes its title from something the former First Lady realized she had been saying a lot lately.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

""Over the last few years, when people would talk to me about a concern of theirs or a problem that they faced, I found myself saying, 'Well, you and me both!' "" Clinton, 72, tells PEOPLE exclusively. ""It became a catch phrase to sum up that a lot of us are worried about the same things and going through the same experiences.""

The new podcast — which Clinton recorded from the New York home where she has been isolating during the pandemic with her husband, former President Bill Clinton — features a wide range of guests covering everything from the upcoming election to cooking in quarantine to themes of grief, resilience and mental health.

In one episode, Clinton speaks with Sybrina Fulton, who became an activist and advocate following the 2012 death of her son, Trayvon Martin.

""Talking with Sybrina was humbling, because she went through what I personally think has to be the worst tragedy any of us can experience: the loss of a child, and in such terrible circumstances as her son was killed,"" says Clinton. ""We talked about being able to find moments of joy in the midst of grief. Finding reasons to get out of bed. Her faith was instrumental to her in being able to continue. Her family. People who rallied around her. It was literally one step at a time, one day at a time. I found it reassuring and also teachable. Maybe somebody who listens to this episode of the podcast needs to hear what she says. I think we need conversations like these.""

There are also lighter moments throughout the series, including an interview with Salt Fat Acid Heat chef Samin Nosrat in which Clinton admits her struggle with a common pandemic kitchen challenge: dried beans.

""I said, 'It's the only thing that will last in your pantry. But I don’t really feel like I know how to cook beans very well!' "" says the grandmother of three. ""And she gave me some tips about soaking beans and adding baking soda to alkalize the water and make the beans softer. It was an entertaining interlude amidst all the other serious challenges we’re facing in our country right now.""

The show, which was produced remotely by executive producer Kathie Russo and producer-editor Julie Subrin, opens a window onto a Hillary Clinton who has swapped her signature pant suits for athleisure and relishes her down time.

""I was surprised by how unfiltered and off-script she is,"" says Conal Byrne, president of the iHeartPodcast Network. Byrne notes that the show's relaxed vibe echoes the viral photo of Clinton taken on a hike just days after her 2016 election loss.

""This show is like the podcast version of that picture,"" says Byrne. ""A lot of the world took solace in that picture, for a million different reasons. But there is a spirit in that picture that I feel like is a lot of the [show].""

Adds Clinton: ""I think we all need to feed our heart, our mind, our soul and our body. All of us, every single day. And yet we don’t have to do it all at one time.""

The avid reader spoke with Fair Fight Action founder Stacey Abrams for one episode, and along with a discussion of current events, the pair also chatted about Abrams' work as a romance novelist under the pen name Selena Montgomery.

""It was just a nice break from the incoming that we all face every day,"" says Clinton. ""And the opportunity to say, 'You know what? I’m going to go read a book.' Or, 'I’m going to go for a long walk. Or cook some beans.' Whatever it might be."""	left

hlazi2	hillaryclinton	Perspective of a Clinton Voter: Can Any Honest Comparison of Trump to Hitler Escape Emotional Bias?	"To begin, let’s not ignore that we live in a world of justice and injustice both, of criminality and innate decency.

Of good and not.

There have been those responsible for concentration camps and those responsible for the Armenian Genocide. There have been those responsible for murdering black men and women and those responsible for hate crimes against Asians.

The Native American Trail of Tears was not made up history, nor were the assassinations of Abraham Lincoln, two Kennedys, and Dr. King.

There are those responsible for killings at an LGBTQ-attended nightclub and those responsible for shootings in schools and movie theaters.

And so on.

Most frequently, the identities of the men and women who have committed such crimes are met with stunned surprise when the facts are exposed.

Who is to say, then, that those who become our leaders are immune? Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini … Putin?

gt3b7e	hillaryclinton	New Transcript Shows Trump Adviser Michael Flynn Colluding With Russia in 2016	"Photo: Alexander Shcherbak/TASS via Getty Images

Michael Flynn, the former Trump national security adviser, pleaded guilty in federal court to the charge of lying to FBI officials about a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador. Flynn’s defenders have insisted his lie was innocent and immaterial.

Late Friday afternoon, the Trump administration released the transcript of that conversation. The timing itself does not indicate much confidence that the transcript would support Flynn’s interpretation (late Friday afternoons not being the customary time to drop favorable news stories). And indeed, the transcript makes Flynn’s call look even less innocent.

On December 29, 2016, President Obama announced economic sanctions against Russia to retaliate for its interference in the presidential elections. Flynn, Trump’s incoming national security adviser, quickly got on the phone with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. When word of the phone call leaked, the administration announced that the call had merely served the purpose of touching base and exchanging pleasantries. “On Christmas Day, General Flynn reached out to the ambassador, sent him a text, and it said, you know, I want to wish you Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, I look forward to touching base with you and working with you,” announced Press Secretary Sean Spicer. “The call centered around the logistics of setting up a call with the president of Russia and the president-elect after he was sworn in.”

The FBI, which was already conducting a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, asked Flynn if he and Kislyak had discussed the sanctions. Flynn insisted he hadn’t, a lie he later pleaded guilty to.

Flynn’s lawyers insisted his call was “consistent with him advocating for, not against, the interests of the United States.” That depends heavily on how one defines “the interests of the United States.” In December 2016, the United States had a strong interest in punishing and deterring hostile foreign governments that had stolen the private communications of American political figures in order to affect the outcome of the election. By January 20, the United States would have a very different interest.

That context looms over the Flynn-Kislyak call. The U.S. government at the time was treating Russia’s efforts to help Trump win as a hostile act. The beneficiary of those acts was not.

A recent lengthy polemic supporting Flynn by conservative reporter Eli Lake presented this defense of the call:

The idea that Flynn had behaved illegally, let alone unethically or immorally or unconventionally, in discussing U.S. foreign policy with the Russians during the transition is beyond absurd. He was the incoming national-security adviser. Phone calls between incoming senior administration officials and foreign governments are common during a presidential transition. And given what is now known about the context of that phone call, the initial spin in the press that Flynn’s conversation with Kislyak had undermined the outgoing administration’s policy was misleading.

The transcripts today quote Flynn telling Kislyak, “Do not, do not uh, allow this (Obama) administration to box us in, right now, okay?” If that does not constitute “undermined the outgoing administration’s policy,” what does?

Two days later, the two men held a follow-up call, in which Kislyak made the premise more explicit. “I just wanted to tell you that we found that these actions have targeted not only against Russia, but also against the president elect.” Flynn replied, “Yeah, yeah,” accepting the premise. Kislyak then said he agreed with Flynn’s request not to retaliate. “We have decided not to act now because, it’s because people [presumably the outgoing Obama administration] are dissatisfied with the loss of elections, and it’s very deplorable.”

Flynn’s discussions with Kislyak were not part of a criminal conspiracy. They were, however, part of a secret channel of communications, the premise of which was that the two parties had a secret common interest against the United States government. One word that might describe this relationship would be “collusion.”"	left

Anti-abortion groups attacked the U.S. Supreme Court nomination of then-Judge Sandra Day O’Connor because they suspected she was a threat to reproductive rights even though she said she was personally opposed to abortion. Years later, O’Connor was one of an unusual trio of high court justices who reaffirmed the core right to an abortion.

Many observers predicted in 1990, when David Souter was nominated to the court, that he would be a conservative vote in favor of abortion restrictions, but he joined O’Connor in upholding a woman’s right to choose in the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey."	left

Guest host for the June 11 Evening with Elaine Weiss is Susan Odgers, a faculty member at Northwestern Michigan College and Board Chair of the Traverse City Human Rights Commission. The National Writers Series recently had an e-chat with Weiss.

NWS: Your home is in Baltimore, Maryland. Currently, what’s life like there, during Gov. Larry Hogan’s “stay home, stay safe” order?

Elaine Weiss: I’m thankful that my governor—like yours in Michigan—cares enough about the citizens of the state to keep us safe. Even as the state of Maryland is phasing in the easing of restrictions, our mayor in Baltimore is keeping them in place, to assure the safety gains made are not squandered. But my life as a writer is much the same—long hours alone at the desk is nothing new for me. But everything else is strange.

NWS: “The Woman’s Hour” is a nonfiction history book that reads like a political thriller. Who are the main characters and what did they want? Tell us about the role Harry Burn, 24, played.

EW: The book is the story of the last battle in the fight for women’s suffrage—the last state to ratify the 19th Amendment—Tennessee. It takes place in Nashville in the summer of 1920 when all the forces for and against women’s suffrage clash in the capital. My main characters are the three women who lead their respective forces into the fight: Carrie Chapman Catt, protegé of Susan B. Anthony, president of the largest suffrage organization, the National American Woman Suffrage Association. She has dedicated her life to “The Cause” and this is the definitive battle—her legacy is at stake, as is the enfranchisement of half of the citizens of the nation.

My second character is young Sue Shelton White, lieutenant to Alice Paul, of the breakaway and more radical wing of the suffrage movement, the National Woman’s Party. Sue is a third-generation suffragist, impatient with the slow pace of progress in achieving equality, willing to be confrontational and disruptive in her quest for the vote. Her future is at stake.

And finally, Josephine Pearson, president of the Tennessee Women Opposed to Woman Suffrage, who fears that suffrage will undermine the American family and the foundations of southern society—i.e. white supremacy. For Josephine and her comrades, the moral collapse of the nation is at stake.

I won’t tell you about Harry Burn, that’s for readers to find out.

NWS: What are some of the common myths about the passage of the 19th Amendment?

EW: 1.) That it just happened: enlightened men of Congress saw fit to correct the egregious omission of women to be able to vote. That it was quick and easy. That it did not require seven decades and three generations of women fighting for it. 2.) That the 19th Amendment did not grant the vote to ALL women. This is not true: the 19th does give the vote to all eligible woman citizens—but the amendment was subverted by Jim Crow laws in the southern states—so African American women (and men) could not enjoy the franchise promised by the 19th (or the 15th) Amendments. Also undermined by racist government policies—both federal and state—classifying Native Americans and Asian Americans as not being citizens, so not eligible to vote.

NWS: Extensive research is a crucial component of your writing. You’ve worked with a variety of librarians, historians and archivists. What key document did you find that surprised you?

EW: I was surprised by many documents, among them the publications of the anti-suffragists.

NWS: The Spanish flu pandemic occurred from 1918–20, what impact did this have on the suffragist movement?

EW: They continued to campaign as best they could—but were severely limited. Rallies and marches were impossible, large meetings and conventions canceled, even parlor meetings nixed. They used the mail to distribute material, telephone, signs, tacking bulletins to trees. Many suffragists ‚ and their families—fell ill; some died. Others took on frontline roles as nurses and health care workers.

NWS: While researching and writing “The Woman’s Hour,” what parts did you have the strongest emotional reaction to?

EW: 1.) The courage of the suffragists. 2.) The bitter intensity of the racial political dynamics. 3.) The hypocrisy of the anti-suffrage arguments.

NWS: “The Woman’s Hour (Adapted for Young Readers)” will be released on June 2. What are your hopes for this edition?

EW: I very much want young people to understand what it took to secure the right to vote—how difficult the fight was, how brave the suffrage activists were, how important it is to stand up against injustice, in all its forms. I hope the story gives them a sense of how lucky they are to have inherited these rights—women’s political equality and expanded role in society, and voting rights in general—and not take them for granted. It will be their job to protect these gains against assault (happening now) and their responsibility to exercise their own voting rights by participating in EVERY election. It’s also just an exciting, inspiring read.

NWS: How involved are you with Steven Spielberg’s upcoming production of “The Woman’s Hour” for television? What can you tell us about this?

EW: I am an executive producer on the project, as is Secretary Hillary Clinton. It is being developed for TV as a scripted limited series. That’s about all for now.

NWS: Michigan’s own Helen Milliken fought tirelessly for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). To pass the ERA, what might we take from the suffragists’ playbook?

EW: The Equal Rights Amendment, introduced into Congress in 1923, WAS passed by Congress (after 50 years of stalling) in 1972. It fell short of full ratification by the states (38 states required) in two successive efforts in the 1970s, due to Congress placing a time-limit on the process. In 2019 Virginia became the 38th state to ratify: it will now go into the courts.

Answer to your question: persistence. And good legal representation.

NWS: You’re friends with Steve Luxenberg, who has been to the National Writers Series twice. What unique history topics are the two of you likely to discuss over lunch?

EW: 19th-century railroad laws.

NWS: Your husband is from Michigan. Can you share a prior Michigan experience?

EW: I’ve learned to hold up my hand, to point on my palm to designate the place in Michigan under discussion. But I always forget if it’s the left or right hand I should be raising."	left
j81ohs	hillaryclinton	Covid-19 in USA - Data analysis with video, tables and bar charts - Statistics and Data	"In this article, a new in-depth look at the Coronavirus in the United States of America. Thanks to video, data and processing we will see the development of active cases of Covid-19 in the United States from the beginning of the pandemic until today.

“Top” 15 States in the United States for active Covid-19 cases

Let’s start first of all from the 8th of October. According to the latest available data the total active cases of Coronavirus in the United States are 2,546,010. A trend of total cases that is undergoing a continuous ups and downs since August, but that all in all seems quite “stable”. The first state for active cases of Covid-19 is California with 394,230 active cases followed by Florida with 303,269 and Georgia with 196,263. In the video below you can see the Top 15 States By Active Cases – 20 April to 8 October.

The evolution of active cases of Covid-19 from May 1 to October 8

If at May 1, 2020 the states with many active cases of Coronavirus were only New York, New Jersey (followed by others like Illinois but with minor data) by October 1, the situation has completely changed. From the map in fact you can see how California is colored black (maximum value is 400,000) but in general there are many states colored red. The number of cases increases as well, as in Florida where there are 303,269 cases. In this map it is interesting to note that in general the distribution of cases is greater where there are also larger cities. This is the example of California which is also the largest state in the United States of America.

The “weight” of the first 5 States per inhabitants

An element has been added to the pie chart. What is the “weight” of the top 5 states of the United States of America (as number of inhabitants) in terms of active cases of Covid-19 compared to the rest of the states?

As you can see from the pie charts the data are certainly interesting. The first 5 states added together have almost always had between 30 and 40% of the total active cases. October is the period in which the weight of these first 5 states is lower than all the other months. This means that the active cases are spreading more and more throughout the United States of America and not only in the states with more inhabitants.

Active cases of Covid-19 in all US States

From August 1 to October 8, the total number of active cases in the United States of America is stable. In fact, the active cases on August 1 were 2,229,539 and on October 1, 2,515,469. The change in the time taken into consideration is +285,930 cases. Different if we take the active cases of June or May: the active cases in this case were 1,117,951 and in May less than 900 thousand. Below in the table you can see all the active cases of Covid-19 in the first days of each month throughout the United States. The last 3 states for number of active cases are: Virgin Islands, Vermont and New Hampshire.

Data updated to January 3, 2020

Below is the table with the total doses of vaccine administered per country worldwide. Data refer to nations for which data are known and are current as of January 3, 2021. Not all nations report data daily. The top nation with the most vaccines administered appears to be China with 4,500,000. In percentage terms, however, China is the sixth most vaccinated state with 0.31 vaccinations per 100 inhabitants. In first place for vaccines administered per 100 inhabitants is Israel, which on January 2nd had a value of 11.5 vaccinated per 100 inhabitants.

In the Bar Chart below you can see the evolution of the top positions by absolute number of vaccines made. Also in this case the data must be put in relation to the number of inhabitants. However, it is useful to understand how the nations are working on the vaccine, when they started and how the vaccination is evolving.

ivhivy	hillaryclinton	Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Dies at 87	“I surely would not be in this room today without the determined efforts of men and women who kept dreams alive, dreams of equal citizenship.” Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the Supreme Court’s feminist icon. Small, soft-spoken, yet fiercely determined, she was an unstoppable force who transformed the law and defied social conventions. “To her fans she’s known as Notorious R.B.G.” Singing: “Supreme Court’s a boys club. She holds it down, no cares given. Who else got six movies about ’em and still livin’?” Ginsburg was hailed as a crusader for women’s rights. Chanting: “D-I-S-S-E-N-T. We’re Notorious R.B.G.!” But her legal legacy was even more sweeping. “The project she brought to the Supreme Court first as the leading women’s rights lawyer of her day, and then as a justice for all those years, I actually think has been kind of misunderstood. She had a really radical project to erase the functional difference between men and women in society. She wanted to make it clear that there should be no such thing as women’s work and men’s work.” “Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court.” In fact, in many of the landmark cases Ginsburg argued before the Supreme Court as a young lawyer for the A.C.L.U., her clients were often men. One key case involved a man from New Jersey, whose wife died during childbirth. “Stephen Wiesenfeld’s case concerns the entitlement —” He wanted to work less and stay home with his son, but found out only widows, not widowers, were eligible for Social Security payments. “Ruth Ginsburg went to court on his behalf and said that law, that distinction between mothers and fathers incorporates a stereotyped assumption of what women do and what men do in the family, and is unconstitutional.” “Laws of this quality help to keep women not on a pedestal, but in a cage.” “She won. And that was the kind of case that she brought. And it was really very significant in the march toward the court establishing a jurisprudence of sex equality.” What inspired Ginsburg to take on such a bold project, and there was little sign of anything radical in the beginning. “Ruth Bader Ginsburg grew up in Brooklyn in a lower middle-class family. When she was in high school, she was a twirler. You know, a cheerleader with a baton. She was known as Kiki Bader. And she played a very traditional female role in her high school.” Ginsburg’s mother, who’d been a star student until she was forced to drop out of school to put her brother through college, had big ambitions for her daughter. But the day before Ruth’s high school graduation, her mother died of cancer. It was that shattering loss, Ginsburg said many years later, that instilled in her the determination to live a life her mother could have only dreamed about. “I pray that I may be all that she would have been had she lived in an age when women could aspire and achieve, and daughters are cherished as much as sons.” The other pivotal turn in Ginsburg’s path came during college. She earned a scholarship to Cornell, where she met a jovial sophomore who became the love of her life. “He was the first boy I ever knew who cared that I had a brain.” Theirs was not a typical 1950s marriage, but an equal partnership. “Her husband, Marty, was a fabulous cook, and she was a terrible cook. And Marty did all the cooking.” “In the historic Harvard Yard, you will see your classmates, men from every section of the country.” A year after Marty enrolled at Harvard Law School, Ruth followed, one of only nine women in a class of more than 550, with a new baby girl in tow. “During their time in law school, Marty became very sick. He had cancer. And she basically took all the notes for him and made it possible for him to graduate on time, while in fact, raising their baby and being a law student herself. Marty recovered and their relationship was very central to her work and her understanding of how it was possible to organize society.” This understanding turned into a mission after law school, when Ginsburg took on a legal study in Sweden where feminism was on the rise. “Sweden, where everything and everyone works.” Swedish women weren’t choosing between careers and family, and they inspired the young lawyer. When Ginsburg returned to the U.S., she launched what would become her radical project. As a law professor and leader of the A.C.L.U. Women’s Rights Project, she took on groundbreaking cases to build constitutional protections against gender discrimination. There was a lot of speculation about why a lawyer hailed as a Thurgood Marshall of women’s rights was representing so many men. “People looking back on that had thought, well, she was kind of trying to sweet talk the court. She was trying to give the court cases and plaintiffs that wouldn’t get those nine old guys very upset and kind of, you know, sneak in a doctrine of sex discrimination. And actually, that’s not accurate. She happened to have male clients because they were making claims that were traditionally, were women’s claims. And she wanted to just shake up the preconceived notions when it came to raising families and providing for them and working in the economy. Everybody should be on equal footing.” The legal crusade quickly unleashed profound changes in the law and daily life, but Ginsburg’s own rise to the federal bench took decades, and a lot of lobbying by her husband, a prominent tax attorney, with key old boys club connections. After getting passed over three times, President Carter nominated Ginsburg to be a federal judge in 1980. “The framers had in mind as the way to protect individual rights and liberty.” People were surprised that the A.C.L.U. activist turned out to be a very moderate judge, a centrist who often sided with conservatives, praised judicial restraint, and slammed Roe v. Wade for going too far, too fast. “I am proud to nominate for associate justice of the Supreme Court, Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg.” Some feminist leaders were concerned when President Clinton tapped Ginsburg for the High Court. “She will be able to be a force for consensus building on the Supreme Court.” But Justice Ginsburg quickly pleased supporters and skeptics alike with her opinions in landmark cases, like the Virginia Military Academy. “May it please the court. V.M.I., the Virginia Military Institute, was established by the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1839.” “V.M.I. was age-old military academy run by the state of Virginia, was men only.” “Stand! Attention!” “It emphasizes competition. It emphasizes standing up to stress. It emphasizes the development of strong character in the face of adversity.” “The question was, did it violate the Constitution to bar women from this school that was entre into the political establishment of the state of Virginia.” Justice Ginsburg believed that omitting women was a constitutional violation. And she ultimately convinced all but one justice, Scalia, to take her position. “The opinion of the court in two cases, the United States against Virginia, will be announced by Justice Ginsburg.” “State actors may not close entrance gates based on fixed notions concerning the roles and abilities of males and females.” “Women will now be walking on the campus of the Virginia Military Institute.” “I think she would say it was the case she was happiest about in her tenure on the court.” “V.M.I. superintendent promises that female cadets will be treated the same as male cadets.” “She used an analysis that increased the level of scrutiny that courts in the future have to give to claims of sex discrimination. I think she found that an extremely satisfying outcome.” Ginsburg’s opinions helped solidify the constitutional protections she’d fought so hard to establish decades earlier. And her grit helped keep her on the bench through colon cancer, pancreatic cancer and the death of her beloved partner. “Justice Ginsburg, even though her husband died yesterday after a battle with cancer, was on the bench.” Ginsburg battled on through it all, unrelentingly tough, but still a consensus builder. She famously forged friendships with right-leaning justices, including Justice Scalia. “You know, what’s not to like? Except her views of the law, of course.” [laughter] Their shared love for opera actually inspired a composer to write a new one, about them. Singing: “We are different, we are one.” “Do you like how you were portrayed in the opera?” “Oh, yes. Especially in the scene where I rescue Justice Scalia, who is locked in a dark room for excessive dissenting.” [laughter] But in her later years, as the court moved to the right, Ginsburg grew bolder in her dissents. “She was not in a position to control the outcome of events. But she was in a position to stake her claim for what the outcome should have been. And she was very strategic and very powerful in using that opportunity.” The opportunity that made her into a rock star came in 2013, when the court struck down a key part of the Voting Rights Act. “Ginsburg wrote a lengthy, scathing dissent.” “She was pretty candid in her displeasure with the court’s decision.” “Hubris, pride, is a fit word for today’s demolition of the Voting Rights Act.” Ginsburg’s fiery dissent inspired law students to lay her words to a beat and turn the 80-year-old justice into the Notorious R.B.G. Singing: “Now I’m in the limelight, because I decide right, court has moved right, but my dissents get cites.” Suddenly, Ginsburg went viral. Children’s books to bumper stickers. Halloween costumes to a Hollywood biopic. “What did you say your name was?” “Ruth Bader Ginsburg.” Even her fitness trainer was a sensation. “Justice is blind, but you know man meat when you see it.” When asked about retirement plans, Ginsburg balked. “There was a senator who announced with great glee that I was going to be dead within six months. That senator, whose name I’ve forgotten, is now himself dead.” [laughter] Ginsburg’s stardom only grew after she criticized then-candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential race. “Ginsburg said, ‘I can’t imagine what the country would be with Donald Trump as our president.’” Ginsburg apologized for her remarks, but instead of retreating, she was emboldened. “As a great man once said, that the true symbol of the United States is not the bald eagle, it is the pendulum. And when the pendulum swings too far in one direction, it will go back.” Notorious R.G.B. became a badge of the Trump resistance, and keeping her on the bench became part of the cause. “Health scare for Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.” “News tonight about the health scare for Supreme Court Justice —” “Ruth Bader Ginsburg, she was hospitalized.” “And those ribs you busted?” “Almost repaired.” After all the spills, surgeries and bouts with cancer, what was it that kept her going? Ginsburg said it was her job on the bench, which she still found exhilarating. But perhaps most of all, it was her radical project, which Ginsburg said was still far from complete. “People ask me, ‘When will you be satisfied with the number of women on the court?’ When they are nine.”	left

gqaxc1	hillaryclinton	BTRTN: “Freedom” in the Age of the Coronavirus	"President Biden's Approval Rating for the week ending May 1, 2021 increased by +1 percentage point versus the prior week, from 53% to 54%.





With a disapproval level of only 4o%, Biden's net approval is +14, slightly up versus the week before (+12), and down from +21 at the time of his inauguration.





Biden's weekly approval rating has not gone below 50% yet in his presidency. His predecessor never achieved the 50% level -- even once.





Biden will try to keep his approval rating at 50% or higher to increase his prospects for reelection. Only one President had an approval rating under 50% and won reelection, George W. Bush in 2004, who had an approval rating of 48%. (This is covering all presidents from Truman forward, when polling to measure approval ratings was first undertaken.)

mm67bo	hillaryclinton	USA - Poverty rate by State - 1980/2019	"In this new article I try to analyze the poverty rate in the United States. We will look at not only the data for the entire nation but also state by state. In fact, the data is different by area.

The article has been realized thanks to the data on the database: census.gov. Poverty rates refer to the people who are in poverty compared to the total population. USA – Poverty rate by State – 1980/2019.

USA – Poverty rate by State – 1980/201

What is the poverty rate in the United States? How has it evolved in individual states? How has it changed since 1980? Which states have the highest poverty rates? In the map created by Statistics and Data, you can see how the rate has evolved from 1980 to 2019. There are 34 million people in poverty in the United States. The poverty rate in 2019 is 10.5%. The state with the highest poverty rate in the entire United States in 2019 is Mississippi with 19.2% of the total population. A figure that peaked in 1988 when it was 27.2. In second place is Louisiana and in third place is New Mexico. In Louisiana in 2019 the poverty rate is 17.9%. In New Mexico it is 15.3. This is followed by South Carolina and Arkansas. Among the top 10 states in the U.S. by poverty rate in 2019, 9 states are part of the South. Only New Mexico is in the top 10 (West US).

The poverty rate in U.S. states from 1980 to 2019

From 1980 to 2019, the poverty rate has definitely gone down. Whereas in 1980 the top 10 states ranged from 24.3% to 16.8%, in 2019 it goes from 19.2% to 12.7%. Interestingly, in 1980 and 2019 the top state is still Mississippi. From 24.3 in 1980 this state is down to 19.2 in 2019. It was not always the first state. In the late 1980s it was surpassed by Louisiana by one year, as well as in the early 1990s. Around the mid-1990s the first state was often New Mexico and for a very brief period also District of Columbia. In the 2000s Arkansas and New Mexico had the highest poverty rates only to be surpassed again by Mississippi. So went the remaining years with these three states vying for the dismal record.

US poverty rate by State by decade

In the table below you can see the poverty rate every 10 years. The last figure refers to 2019 because the 2020 figures are not yet available. It is clear that the 2020 data will be a very strong increase because of Covid-19. In general, one can see that there has been a strong decrease from the 1990s to the 2000s. Almost all the states that had a very high rate decreased. For example, Alabama went from 19.2 in 1990 to 13.3 in 2000. Louisiana went from 23.6 to 17.2. A decade later, partly as a result of the financial crisis, the figures rose again to the levels of ten years earlier. In fact, the 2010 figures are not too far off from 1990. In 2019, on the other hand, the data are again positive. As already mentioned it will be very interesting to see the trend next year which could probably take us back ten years to 2010 again.

Households by Total Money Income: 1967 to 2019

We have seen the trend in the poverty rate percentage by individual state. But what is the trend in household income at the national level? Has income increased or decreased from 1967 to 2019? The blue line indicates people with incomes below $15,000. These have decreased from 14.8 of the total to 9.1. Also decreasing albeit slightly are people with incomes between $15,000 and $24,999. In fact, these fell from 10.2 in 1967 to 8 points in 2019. While very high salaries have increased with a range that has gone from medium to high salaries, however, it seems that the category “in between” has all in all remained fairly the same as previous years.

Is the income of American households the same for everyone?

To complete the analysis on income and poverty rate I analysed the distribution of income from 1967 to 2019 by race.

In the table below you can see the distribution of income above 200k by race. Black and white Americans who had an income above 200k were the same: about 1% of the population. But while today almost 11% of the white American population has an income above $200,000, blacks stop at 4.9 of the total. A variation that has grown since the mid-1980s and has not stopped since.

ju0u9m	hillaryclinton	Evolution of Number of Deaths for leading causes of Death - U.S. (2020) - Statistics and Data	"In this article/video a comparison between deaths for the main causes of death in the United States. The figure refers to the period from January 1 to November 8. For the data on Covid-19 the New York Times was used as a source. For data on other causes of death, 2018 data from the Center for Disease Control was used. Evolution of Number of Deaths for leading causes of Death – U.S.

Heart Disease, Cancer and Covid-19 the top three diseases by number of deaths in the U.S.

What are the main causes of death in the US? According to the latest data as of November 8, the deaths of Covid-19 are about 237,572. Covid-19 is the third leading cause of death in the US. A very high figure surpassed only by Heart Disease and Cancer. These two, on the other hand, according to 2018 projections, make 556,990 victims and 515,397 victims.



As far as the Covid-19 is concerned, the acceleration in terms of victims is obviously striking. If until March 31 the victims were “only” 4000, in very few months the number has increased. In April alone, the number has increased from about 4000 victims to more than 60 thousand.

Covid-19 cases continue to rise in the US

The new cases of Covid-19 don’t seem to stop. On November 13, the highest altitude was reached: 181,194 in a single day. A very strong leap forward if we think that a month ago, on October 13, the new cases had been about 54 thousand. In terms of victims, the deaths on November 13 were 1398. Also in this case compared to the month of October and sevenmpre the data peaks have increased. No nai nai levels of April but surely we are witnessing a new rise. In total the cases of Covid-19 found in the U.S. are now 10.8 million and the total victims 244 thousand.

Useful links and data sources

Several sources have been used to realize this article. For the data on Covid-19 the data from the New York Times. For data on victims by typology: Center for Disease Control.

j3coft	hillaryclinton	Hillary Clinton to Exec-Produce ‘The Woman’s Hour’ Series at The CW	"RELATED STORIES Hulu Eyes Alt-Reality Hillary Series

Hulu Eyes Alt-Reality Hillary Series Hillary Review: Hulu's Documentary Goes Deep, But Will It Change Minds?

The CW plans to give a few lessons in political history, with the help of Hillary Clinton.

The network is developing The Woman’s Hour, an anthology drama that counts Clinton among its executive producers, TVLine has learned.

The potential first season of The Woman’s Hour would take inspiration from Elaine Weiss’ 2018 nonfiction book, The Woman’s Hour: The Great Fight to Win the Vote, and would shed light on the battle to ratify the 19th Amendment. Per the official logline, future Woman’s Hour seasons will “celebrate those who changed history and have strong contemporary reverberations, appealing to today’s rising tide of young, politically active audiences.”

Weiss will serve as an EP alongside Clinton, while Amblin Television (co-founded by Steven Spielberg) and Warner Bros. Television will produce. Angelina Burnett (Halt and Catch Fire, Hannibal) is on board as writer, executive producer and showrunner.

Earlier this year, Clinton was the subject of Hulu’s four-part docuseries Hillary, which chronicled the former secretary of state’s multi-decade career in politics, including her ill-fated run for president against Donald Trump in 2016. Hulu is now also developing Rodham, a series adaptation of Curtis Sittenfeld’s novel that imagines a world in which Clinton never married her husband, Bill.

myg86v	hillaryclinton	USA - Poverty rate by State - 1980/2019	"In this new article I try to analyze the poverty rate in the United States. We will look at not only the data for the entire nation but also state by state. In fact, the data is different by area.

The article has been realized thanks to the data on the database: census.gov. Poverty rates refer to the people who are in poverty compared to the total population. USA – Poverty rate by State – 1980/2019.

USA – Poverty rate by State – 1980/201

What is the poverty rate in the United States? How has it evolved in individual states? How has it changed since 1980? Which states have the highest poverty rates? In the map created by Statistics and Data, you can see how the rate has evolved from 1980 to 2019. There are 34 million people in poverty in the United States. The poverty rate in 2019 is 10.5%. The state with the highest poverty rate in the entire United States in 2019 is Mississippi with 19.2% of the total population. A figure that peaked in 1988 when it was 27.2. In second place is Louisiana and in third place is New Mexico. In Louisiana in 2019 the poverty rate is 17.9%. In New Mexico it is 15.3. This is followed by South Carolina and Arkansas. Among the top 10 states in the U.S. by poverty rate in 2019, 9 states are part of the South. Only New Mexico is in the top 10 (West US).

The poverty rate in U.S. states from 1980 to 2019

From 1980 to 2019, the poverty rate has definitely gone down. Whereas in 1980 the top 10 states ranged from 24.3% to 16.8%, in 2019 it goes from 19.2% to 12.7%. Interestingly, in 1980 and 2019 the top state is still Mississippi. From 24.3 in 1980 this state is down to 19.2 in 2019. It was not always the first state. In the late 1980s it was surpassed by Louisiana by one year, as well as in the early 1990s. Around the mid-1990s the first state was often New Mexico and for a very brief period also District of Columbia. In the 2000s Arkansas and New Mexico had the highest poverty rates only to be surpassed again by Mississippi. So went the remaining years with these three states vying for the dismal record.

US poverty rate by State by decade

In the table below you can see the poverty rate every 10 years. The last figure refers to 2019 because the 2020 figures are not yet available. It is clear that the 2020 data will be a very strong increase because of Covid-19. In general, one can see that there has been a strong decrease from the 1990s to the 2000s. Almost all the states that had a very high rate decreased. For example, Alabama went from 19.2 in 1990 to 13.3 in 2000. Louisiana went from 23.6 to 17.2. A decade later, partly as a result of the financial crisis, the figures rose again to the levels of ten years earlier. In fact, the 2010 figures are not too far off from 1990. In 2019, on the other hand, the data are again positive. As already mentioned it will be very interesting to see the trend next year which could probably take us back ten years to 2010 again.

Households by Total Money Income: 1967 to 2019

We have seen the trend in the poverty rate percentage by individual state. But what is the trend in household income at the national level? Has income increased or decreased from 1967 to 2019? The blue line indicates people with incomes below $15,000. These have decreased from 14.8 of the total to 9.1. Also decreasing albeit slightly are people with incomes between $15,000 and $24,999. In fact, these fell from 10.2 in 1967 to 8 points in 2019. While very high salaries have increased with a range that has gone from medium to high salaries, however, it seems that the category “in between” has all in all remained fairly the same as previous years.

Is the income of American households the same for everyone?

To complete the analysis on income and poverty rate I analysed the distribution of income from 1967 to 2019 by race.

In the table below you can see the distribution of income above 200k by race. Black and white Americans who had an income above 200k were the same: about 1% of the population. But while today almost 11% of the white American population has an income above $200,000, blacks stop at 4.9 of the total. A variation that has grown since the mid-1980s and has not stopped since.

hk8ne3	hillaryclinton	Hillary Clinton talks Trump, protests and that time Chelsea brought her and Bill together	"“Hillary,” Hulu’s four-part documentary about Hillary Clinton, came out of 2,000 hours of footage shot during her 2016 presidential campaign, 35 hours of fresh interviews with the subject herself and a bevy of archival material that filmmaker Nanette Burstein found while researching the project.

When Burstein had a version of the movie that was close to locked, she sent it to Clinton at her home in Chappaqua, N.Y., where she watched it in a single sitting. As you might expect, taking it all in, Clinton says, chuckling, was an “overwhelming experience.”

“It’s daunting to watch your life unfold on the screen,” Clinton says. She’s on the phone, along with Burstein, in early June, as America continues to reel from the coronavirus pandemic and nationwide protests following the police killing of George Floyd.

Clinton understands the despair that drives the protests and pervades the country in the wake of more than 120,000 (and counting) pandemic deaths and months of economic hardship.

But she also sees signs for cautious optimism.

“If you look at the young people who are the primary movers of the peaceful protests in response to Mr. Floyd’s killing, I’m hopeful that this can break open not only some hearts but some structural impediments to equality and justice in a way that defies the distraction of the second-to-second demands of social media,” Clinton says.

“And it may well be that a leader like [Donald] Trump, who depends upon distraction, has finally been brought down to earth because people are watching in real time what is happening and how inadequate his response has been to these historic moments.”

Over the course of a quick 45 minutes, we discussed the news, the documentary and the ways the two intersect.

Were there things in the documentary that surprised you? Maybe the footage of your daughter Chelsea putting herself between you and Bill, holding both your hands, “filling in the empty space,” as Bill puts it, that existed after he addressed the nation about his relationship with Monica Lewinski?

Clinton: That was one of those moments that I remembered but I hadn’t seen the footage for years until I saw the movie. Watching it again was pretty emotional. I had no idea Chelsea was going to do that.

Nanette found things, like me being burned in effigy when I was working for healthcare, that I had forgotten about. And I have to say, I was struck again about how trying to get people universal healthcare could be whipped up into such a frenzy. That was kind of a moment.

Burstein: I thought that clip was iconic of where our country is at right now, so divided. That’s what made me passionate as a filmmaker, understanding the antecedents to when partisan politics became so entrenched.

The documentary ends on a positive tenor, noting the number of women elected to Congress in 2018 and with you saying that maybe your loss will be remembered as a turning point that lit the fuse. Rewatching it, the phrase “lit the fuse” hit me in a much different way.

Clinton: I can understand that. I’ve had people contact me about the documentary, and it’s interesting because people who watched it early had a different take than people who watched it recently.

So much of what we’re seeing now, sadly, was known about Trump and the kind of people who were loyal to him. But it turned out to be even worse than what I thought it would be. Despite having my own front-row seat and being concerned about his character and behavior, he has gone further and broken more norms and undermined our institutions more deeply than I thought would have been possible in such a short period of time.

We see you in the movie at his inauguration, showing up, taking a deep breath and worrying that he wouldn’t rise to the occasion.

Clinton: Whathas been so surprising to me is how he can barely make an effort to rise to the occasion. I truly don’t think he can get out of his own way. Everything has to be all about him. If it’s about a terrible pandemic with an unprecedented virus, he tries to ignore it, tries to keep the attention on himself. Then when it becomes impossible to do that, he tries to seize the moment and turn it into a daily rally, like he loves to do. And then when it becomes impossible to ignore, he tries to change the subject; he tries to withdraw from the spotlight so he can come up with some other diversion and distraction for the body politic and the press.

Then when we have a terrible killing like we did in Minneapolis, he makes some steps toward — in the very early hours after we all saw that horrific video — to look like he’s going to be empathetic, to look like he’s going to try to talk about this stripping bare of the continuing racism and inequities of law enforcement and the justice system. And then he pivots again because he’s not comfortable doing that. He doesn’t have even the minor amount of empathy to fake it, to look like he is concerned, and he reverts to the belligerence and the threat-making and the photo-opping, all the tried-and-true tactics that feed his need for control and dominance and attention.

You tweeted about his recent photo op, when troops used tear gas to clear protesters so Trump could walk to St. John’s Church and hold up a Bible, calling it a “horrifying use of presidential power.” What was that like to watch?

Clinton: It was beyond my comprehension. We have never seen anything like this. He is without shame. It is a mystery why anybody with a beating heart and a working mind still supports him.

You mentioned the inauguration. I’d been to every inauguration since 1993, and I had a really hard time going to that one, but I thought, “OK. The moment might very well transform him, and the awesome responsibility of the office as well.” And yet I heard him get up and give that speech that was the absolute opposite of anything that could have brought the country together. Politics should be about addition, about finding common ground. No, he was speaking to his outraged base.

And in the movie, I say, I was sitting next to George W. Bush — who has now spoken out twice, trying to provide some ballast in this time we’re going through, which I appreciate, despite my political disagreements with him — and he just turned to me and said, “That was some weird [stuff].” And every single day has been a surprise, an unpleasant surprise, about how there seems to be no bottom to this man and his presidency.

“Hillary” documents the media’s gender bias in your presidential campaigns. How do you think the women running for president this year were treated?

It was a very mixed picture. On the one hand, we had more women running, which was a big positive because then you could see that women, just like men, had different styles, different approaches, different platforms. And yet at the same time, there were still some of the same tropes and attitudes being expressed about women becoming president and what kind of person could beat Donald Trump and all of the usual questioning. It was a step forward, but not as big a step as I wish it had been.

Watching those clips in the movie, men screaming, “Iron my shirt,” or John Edwards saying, “I’m not sure about that coat” during a debate, made me crazy. Did you ever come close to snapping?

We all have that choice. You can escalate or you can try to take a deep breath and deal with it thoughtfully. I believe strongly in what I think is right. And I am willing to stand up for it. But I’m not interested in engaging in some kind of verbal confrontation for the sake of delivering a flashpoint.

What’s fascinating to me is the thoughtful, deliberate response or the careful thinking before you speak is somehow viewed as less authentic than the blowing up. And we’ve seen the result of that now, sadly, for 3½ years, someone who doesn’t have the discipline, someone who doesn’t care what he says because he came from reality TV. He was a bankrupt businessman who got a second wind because he could scream at people, “You’re fired.”"	left

An Illinois anti-shutdown protester. In English the sign means, “Work makes you free.” The same message was on the gate over Auschwitz. (Twitter)

In the early years of the Obama presidency, I penned a column stating the Republican Party would eventually split. The sane, more moderate Republicans would realize that with the country’s changing demographics they would have to tone down the white supremacy and start appealing to minority voters.

I also suggested a faction of the party would break away and form an explicitly white nationalist party. I said this because I had been reading stories about CPAC, an annual political convention for conservatives. Some of the white nationalists and neo-confederates in attendance were demanding the GOP become the “white party.”

Steve King under fire for re-tweeting Nazi sympathizer

However, for a while the GOP tried to embrace inclusivity. At the 2012 Republican National Convention, Sen. Lindsay Graham stated the party could no longer win national elections because “The demographics race we’re losing badly … [Republicans are] not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term.”

Embracing White Nationalism

In 2009, the party named Michael Steele, a black Maryland legislator, RNC chair and he did a fairly good job of raising money and overseeing the party’s recapture of the House. But he faced pushback and resigned in 2011. Steele, who tried to diversify the party claimed he was once told that he rubbed some party members the wrong way because he “sounded too black.” Huh? Steele, who has called Donald Trump a racist, now feels alienated from his party.

The GOP continues to tolerate Iowa Rep. Steve King who has explicitly stated his desire for a country dominated by white men. Reacting to the increased number of blacks, Latinos and women representatives in Congress, King said, “You could look over there and think the Democratic Party is no country for white men,” according to a 2019 New York Times article.

When Trump ran for president, he seized upon festering racial issues such as Obama’s birth certificate and immigration. And his messages resonated with a lot of people. My prediction turned out to be wrong, instead of splitting with the white nationalist wing, the GOP embraced it and the white nationalists essentially took over the party. Whether they admit it or not, white nationalism is now a main feature of the GOP’s platform.

For example, the GOP continues to tolerate Iowa Rep. Steve King who has explicitly stated his desire for a country dominated by white men. Reacting to the increased number of blacks, Latinos and women representatives in Congress, King said, “You could look over there and think the Democratic Party is no country for white men,” according to a 2019 New York Times article.

King also regularly associates with European neo-Nazis. However, as I have stated in previous columns, neo-Nazis seem to be tolerated in the Republican Party. I often receive pushback online for this, but the truth is evident.

Tucker Carlson, the top-rated pundit on FOX News, regularly talks about “the great replacement,” a conspiracy theory which suggests Jews are conspiring to replace white majorities in Europe and North America with immigrants from the developing world.

Former White House advisor Steve Bannon, was former CEO of Breitbart, an alt-right cesspool. He has also associated with neo-fascist groups in Europe. Stephen Miller, a descendant of Jewish refugees, would like to halt all forms of immigration and suggested mass roundups of undocumented families. And fake counter-terrorism adviser Sebastian Gorka showed up to the inauguration wearing a Nazi medal. He’s also been associated with Hungarian neo-Nazi groups.

Letting the Elderly Die

However, neo-Nazi attitudes have spread to other Republicans. Recently, several Republicans have called for an end to the shutdown by sacrificing the elderly.

Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick has stated grandparents should sacrifice themselves for the economy. Far-right political commentator Ben Shapiro also echoed this sentiment. He suggested that we might need to let some old people die so the country can get back to work

“If somebody who is 81, dies of Covid-19 that is not the same thing as somebody who is 30 dying of Covid-19,” said Shapiro on the Rubin Report.

Ken Turnage II, chairman of the city planning commission of Antioch, was removed from his post after he called for culling the sick, the weak and the homeless, according to the Huffington Post.

“In my opinion we need to adapt a Herd Mentality. A herd gathers its ranks, it allows the sick, the old, the injured to meet its natural course in nature.” said Turnage in a Facebook post.

You know who also espoused these kinds of views? Actual Nazis, you know the goose-stepping, Third Reich kind. They also advocated racial purity and Eugenics policies that rid society of the weak and infirm.

The website Facing History stated, “The first to be eliminated were too young to speak on their own behalf. In fall 1938, the parents of a severely disabled infant petitioned Hitler for the right to kill their child. He granted the petition and saw in the request an opportunity to encourage what he called ‘mercy killings’ or ‘euthanasia.’ In fact, according to science historian Robert N. Proctor, the goal was not to provide mercy to the victims but to improve the ‘Aryan’ race and make hospital beds and personnel available for the coming war.”

However, a sign at an Illinois anti-shutdown rally showed how deeply these messages have been embedded in the GOP. Translated into English, the sign reads “Work sets You Free.” This is the exact same sign over a Nazi death camp. The protester claimed that “some of her friends are Jews.” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzer is of Jewish descent.

It’s evident that the GOP has not only been infiltrated by white nationalists, but also by neo-Nazis.

This was summed up in a scathing May 2 Daily Kos article.

“This terrifying stance should scare you to do everything you can to make sure this Nazified version of the GOP is thrown out of power this year. Otherwise, you or your family might be subjected to the ‘next stage.’ Right now, the right is asking for voluntary sacrifices of the old and weak, but history shows it’s just a few atrocities away from being made mandatory,” said DemSem.

But let’s leave the last word to King, who was hilariously honest after meeting with Austrian neo-Nazis.

“If they were in America pushing the platform that they push, they would be Republicans,” said King in a 2018 Washington Post article.

Anne Raup/Anchorage Daily News, via Associated Press As of Saturday morning, only 56 percent of Alaska voters’ ballots had been counted, less than in any other state. There is little question about who will take the state’s three electoral votes — President Trump is leading, and the state has voted for a Republican in every presidential election since 1964 — but its slow count has put Alaska in league with the five states where close races have kept most news outlets from projecting a winner (Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and North Carolina). Two factors seem to be responsible for the slow count: the state’s late deadline for mailed absentee ballots and a process of ensuring that voters do not vote twice. Alaska allows absentee ballots to arrive up to 10 days after Election Day for most voters, as long as they are postmarked by Election Day. Election officials also must wait for paper voter history records to be mailed from precincts to make sure no one votes twice. Only then can the ballots from a precinct be opened and counted, Tiffany Montemayor, a spokeswoman for the state’s election division, said in an email. “Given the geographic expanse of Alaska, this does take some time,” she said.

Nov. 7, 2020, 9:17 a.m. ET Nov. 7, 2020, 9:17 a.m. ET Rethinking the causes of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 defeat: Should the 2020 results prompt a reassessment? Hillary Clinton at a campaign event in 2016. Credit... Eric Thayer for The New York Times There was one subset of the political world that felt vindicated by the nail-biter presidential race: Democrats who worked for Hillary Clinton. The closeness of the Biden-Trump race suggests that the 2016 election outcome may have been less about Mrs. Clinton’s political weaknesses than it was about Mr. Trump’s political strengths. In some of the states that Mr. Biden managed to flip, like Wisconsin, his victory was by a slim margin of about 20,000 votes. Four years ago, Mrs. Clinton lost the state by about 22,000. A potential victory with more than 300 electoral votes would look like a blowout for Mr. Biden, but it would also mask the fact that in some of the most critical states, the race was still only won by a hair. Mr. Biden has not received the wide margins nationwide that many liberals had been hoping for. The silver lining for some former members of Clintonworld, as one put it: The 2016 Democratic nominee might not go down in history as the political version of Bill Buckner, who blew the World Series for the Red Sox in 1986 by letting a ground ball go through his legs. “His electoral strength in 2016 had less to do with any shortcomings of Hillary Clinton as a candidate or of her campaign than with Trump’s own appeal to a broad segment of the population,” Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union and a member of the D.N.C.’s executive committee, said of Mr. Trump. “We need as Democrats to understand that and confront it more effectively going forward.” Philippe Reines, a former top adviser to Mrs. Clinton both in the Senate and at the State Department, was even more blunt. “Hillary’s owed more than a few apologies for how her campaign was assessed,” Mr. Reines said. Jennifer Palmieri, who served as communications director for the 2016 Clinton campaign, said that the current election gives a new perspective to the race four years ago. “There’s only so much you can do to ameliorate larger forces,” Ms. Palmieri said. “When I see young Latino and African-American men siding with Trump in a way they didn’t in 2016, I don’t fault the Biden campaign’s African-American radio program. It is a symptom of a larger change that’s happening.” Read more

Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee for president, in Wilmington, Del., on Friday. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times By Saturday morning on the east coast, Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s lead in Georgia had surpassed 7,000 votes, but the race there and in some other key states that could decide the next president remained uncalled. In a brief speech late on Friday night, Mr. Biden expressed confidence that he would prevail. With some, but not all, of the pivotal counties planning to report the count of additional ballots on Saturday, there was an expectation that a winner could be declared soon. But when that might happen is still unclear. Here’s where things stand in the four key states where additional results could come on Saturday. Arizona: Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, is expected to post its next report on Saturday at 11 a.m. Eastern. Officials there said nearly all of their early ballots would be counted by that point, and only a smaller number of provisional and other ballots would remain. Mr. Biden led President Trump in the state by 29,861 votes early Saturday.

Georgia: The secretary of state said on Friday that because of the small margin between the presidential candidates, a recount would be inevitable. Mr. Biden widened his lead slightly overnight, to over 7,000, but a recount remains no less likely.

Nevada: Numbers continue to favor Mr. Biden, who leads by 22,657 votes. Officials in Clark County, where tens of thousands of ballots are left to count, plan to release results twice a day going forward.

Pennsylvania: Mr. Biden leads President Trump. The remaining mail ballots are expected to favor Democrats, and some counties could report updated results on Saturday. Philadelphia officials said the count there could take a few more days to complete. Read more

Journalists from all over the world waited for the result of the U.S. presidential election in Washington, D.C., on Friday. Credit... Eric Baradat/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images As Day 4 of the United States election turned into Day 5 on Saturday, the race for president appeared to slow to a crawl. The news anchor Don Lemon read text messages from his friends about the Georgia count aloud on CNN. Foreign newspapers wrote about the unchanged overnight tally with a hint of exasperation. On a livestream of Philadelphia’s vote-counting site, boxes sat behind fences and not a single person stirred. “New results out of Georgia,” Britain’s Guardian newspaper reported early Saturday, “and — they just basically say the same thing.” Saturday morning could yet bring decisive news: Pennsylvania could move out of recount territory if the margin widens, and Arizona and Nevada were expected to declare new votes. But whereas 24 hours earlier, all-night ballot counting had given Joseph R. Biden Jr. the lead in Georgia, the early hours of Saturday seemed comparatively sedate. Nothing was changing, and nobody was quite sure when it would. “It feels like just one long day,” Mr. Lemon said. Read more

Philadelphia officials have said they will release another update of votes from the city sometime today . They expect to announce the results of between 2,000 and 3,000 votes. The remaining 40,000 votes could take a few more days to count and report, officials said.

By 7 p.m. Eastern, officials in Clark County, Nevada, say they will provide an update on the 63,000 ballots still left to be counted there. Joseph R. Biden Jr. currently leads President Trump in the state by more than more than 20,000 votes, and many of its outstanding ballots are from Clark County, which includes Las Vegas.

Friday night during prime time , Mr. Biden plans to address the nation, according to a campaign official.

By 9 p.m. Eastern, officials in Maricopa County, Ariz., expect to release the results of roughly 100,000 votes. The county is the state’s largest, and the results there will be key in determining the outcome of its Electoral College votes. Mr. Trump released a statement Friday afternoon in which he said that he and his team would continue to fight to ensure that “all legal ballots must be counted and all illegal ballots should not be counted.” It was not clear whether the president would address the nation on Friday as he did the night before.

If the race ends that way, the candidates would head to a runoff in January, as required by state law. “Georgia is the most competitive state in the country,” Mr. Ossoff said. “And there were some who doubted that. But the work that’s been done over the last 10 years, the work that’s being led by people like Stacey Abrams, we’re now seeing that change has come to Georgia, and Georgia is the heart of the change that’s coming to America.” Democrats have lost nearly every statewide runoff in Georgia for the past 30 years, including Mr. Ossoff, who lost in a runoff for a House seat in 2017. Mr. Perdue’s campaign manager referenced that loss in a statement Thursday. “There’s only one candidate in this race who has ever lost a runoff, and it isn’t David Perdue,” said the manager, Ben Fry. Despite that history, Mr. Ossoff projected confidence for the likely runoff. “Georgia voters stood up in record-shattering numbers to demand change for our state and change in this country,” Mr. Ossoff said. Adding, “Change is coming to America, and retirement is coming for Senator David Perdue.” “We’re going to mobilize people like never before. We’re going to get this done thanks to the hard work that we put in since 2012,” said Cecilia Houston-Torrence, a supporter of Mr. Ossoff’s who was at Grant Park. “We’re going to get them to the polls in January,” she added. “I promise you.” Read more

Alyssa Pointer/Atlanta Journal-Constitution, via Associated Press Carolyn Bourdeaux, a two-time Democratic candidate and college professor, flipped an open House seat in Georgia on Friday that had become a top priority for Democrats seeking to expand their majority in the House. Dr. Bourdeaux, 50, who lost her previous bid to represent the Seventh Congressional District in 2018 by fewer than 500 votes, defeated the Republican candidate Rich McCormick in the suburban district northeast of Atlanta, according to The Associated Press. The district, which includes parts of Gwinnett and Forsyth Counties, had once been fertile ground for Republicans. But as with suburbs across the nation, it has become increasingly diverse and has been shifting toward Democrats, particularly since President Trump took office. Representative Rob Woodall, who announced in February that he would not seek re-election, had held the seat for five terms. Mr. Woodall is one of nearly three dozen Republicans who are leaving the House, an exodus that has been accelerated by the president’s unpopularity in the suburbs. Read more

Nov. 6, 2020, 2:18 p.m. ET Nov. 6, 2020, 2:18 p.m. ET In Midwest farm country, nearly everyone is anxious, no matter whom they voted for. Support for the Democratic ticket on a farm in Black Earth, Wis. Credit... Bing Guan/Reuters One of President Trump’s most lopsided margins of victory came in northern Michigan’s rural Missaukee County, where he got more than 75 percent of the vote, according to unofficial tallies. On Friday, the prospect of his loss left some of his supporters feeling stunned and angry. “People are upset,” said Jodi DeHate, 48, who works at an organization that promotes environmental agriculture practices. “They don’t understand. It’s a lot of confusion.” Ms. DeHate, whose five-acre family farm raises melons and vegetables for farmers’ markets, voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 and again this year. She said she had been watching anxiously since Election Day as mail ballots in Detroit and the suburbs slowly tilted Michigan to Joseph R. Biden Jr. She was leery of the lopsided margins that swung in Mr. Biden’s favor, but at the same time, was not ready to embrace Mr. Trump’s false tirades about the vote being stolen. “It’s heavily Democratic anyways,” Ms. DeHate said of the parts of Michigan that gave Mr. Biden his victory there. Aid from the Trump administration has helped to keep farmers afloat throughout the pandemic, Ms. DeHate said, and she worried that a Biden administration would tighten regulations on farming. “I don’t think he has a good grasp of what agriculture really does,” she said of Mr. Biden. But others who have relied on agriculture to make a living were glad to see a change. In Albany, Wis., on what was once a family farm, Rachael Lindemann felt vindicated. Ms. Lindemann voted Democratic in 2016, but her husband, a struggling dairy farmer, supported Mr. Trump. Their financial struggles deepened as Mr. Trump waged a trade war with China, and the couple eventually sold their farm and cows. Mr. Lindemann took a construction job. This year, he voted for Mr. Biden. “He changed his mind,” Ms. Lindemann said. As the count dragged on this week, the Lindemanns were checking the news once in the morning and once at night; she reads, and he watches videos on his phone. With the margins incredibly thin and recounts and legal challenges looming, Ms. Lindemann said she was not celebrating. “I’m not going to count my chickens before they’re hatched,” she said. “I know he’s going to throw a 5-year-old tantrum, and he’s going to turn over every table he can. We don’t have a president yet.” Read more

David Bossie speaking at an Arizona Republican Party news conference on Thursday in Phoenix. Credit... Matt York/Associated Press President Trump’s campaign is installing an adviser, David Bossie, to lead its efforts to challenge election outcomes in several states, a campaign official said on Friday. Mr. Bossie was tapped by the Trump campaign manager, Bill Stepien, and the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to take on the role, as the president’s advisers have signaled that they plan to continue legal fights over the tabulation of votes in a string of states, officials said. Mr. Bossie, Trump’s deputy campaign manager in 2016 and the head of the conservative advocacy group Citizens United, has survived partisan battles in Washington over the last 30 years. His combative approach appeals to Mr. Trump. In the three days since the election, the Trump campaign has raised concerns and objections over voting issues in several states. Trump family members and loyalists have held news conferences claiming irregularities. But there has been no single person in charge of the legal effort to contest results in a number of states. Putting Mr. Bossie there is an attempt to rectify that. “From the beginning we have said that all legal ballots must be counted and all illegal ballots should not be counted,” Mr. Trump said Friday in a statement in which he promised a vigorous legal challenge. “We will pursue this process through every aspect of the law to guarantee that the American people have confidence in our government,” he said.

Nov. 6, 2020, 1:52 p.m. ET Nov. 6, 2020, 1:52 p.m. ET Trump’s false election fraud claims split Republicans, some declaring total support and others condemning him. President Trump at the White House on Thursday. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times Republican reaction to President Trump’s baseless claims of election fraud ranged widely, from vigorous backing to sharp condemnations to carefully constructed support for the idea of fair elections without any endorsement of the president’s fabricated assertions of an election conspiracy. Republican Senators Mitch McConnell, Mitt Romney and Pat Toomey, and Ivanka Trump, Mr. Trump’s daughter, all declined to echo Mr. Trump’s fraud claims in statements on the election. While Mr. McConnell and Ms. Trump’s tweets were superficially supportive of the president, Mr. Romney and Mr. Toomey directly criticized him. In a stinging statement, Mr. Romney said that Mr. Trump, while free to request recounts and present valid evidence of fraud, “is wrong to say that the election was rigged, corrupt and stolen — doing so weakens the cause of freedom here and around the world, weakens the institutions that lie at the foundations of the Republic, and recklessly inflames destructive and dangerous passions.” Ms. Trump, echoing what Vice President Mike Pence said Thursday night, did not include talk of conspiracy or fraud. “Every legally cast vote should be counted. Every illegally cast vote should not. This should not be controversial,” Ms. Trump wrote. “This is not a partisan statement — free and fair elections are the foundation of our democracy.” Her words were a contrast to those of her brothers, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, who have both made sweeping accusations of widespread fraud. Earlier in the morning, Donald Trump Jr. tweeted the baseless claim that there is “infinitely more evidence of voter fraud than there ever was of ‘Russia Collusion’ but strangely no one in the media wants to look into it.” And some Republicans seem prepared to defend Mr. Trump’s position without reservation. “President Trump won this election,” Representative Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader, told the Fox News host Laura Ingraham on Thursday night. “So everyone who’s listening: Do not be quiet. Do not be silent about this. We cannot allow this to happen before our very eyes.” Read more

Nov. 6, 2020, 1:38 p.m. ET Nov. 6, 2020, 1:38 p.m. ET Analysis: Trump’s path to victory in Nevada appears more difficult. Credit... The New York Times Joseph R. Biden Jr. has increased his lead in Nevada to 1.6 percentage points on Friday after winning a new round of ballots in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, by about a two-to-one margin. So far, no news organization has projected the state for Mr. Biden, but the president’s path to victory there has become exceedingly narrow. Virtually all of the remaining ballots are from Clark County, according to the Nevada secretary of state. Most of the ballots are mail absentee ballots, which broke for Mr. Biden by a wide margin in Clark County and statewide. The other ballots are provisional ballots or from same-day registrants. Those ballots might be more competitive but are highly unlikely to significantly favor Mr. Trump in a Democratic county. The state also accepts postmarked ballots by Nov. 10, which would be expected to back Mr. Biden as well. At a news conference, the Clark County registrar, Joe Gloria, said the county still had 63,000 ballots left to be counted. He said that the county would provide updated results by 7 p.m. Eastern.

Nov. 6, 2020, 1:32 p.m. ET Nov. 6, 2020, 1:32 p.m. ET Patrick McGeehan and A New Jersey congressman who switched parties and backed Trump has kept his seat. Representative Jeff Van Drew’s race against Amy Kennedy was the last New Jersey congressional contest to be called. Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times Representative Jeff Van Drew, a onetime Democrat who switched parties in December and declared allegiance to President Trump, held onto his New Jersey seat in a race against Amy Kennedy, a former teacher who married into the American political dynasty. The race was the last New Jersey congressional contest to be decided, and one of only two in the state won by a Republican. Mr. Van Drew’s victory appeared to vindicate his politically fraught decision to cross party lines and align himself with Mr. Trump during last year’s impeachment proceedings. The Associated Press declared Mr. Van Drew the winner on Friday. Its tally showed that he had received 51.5 percent of the votes, compared with 46.9 percent for Ms. Kennedy. First elected to the House two years ago as a Democrat, Mr. Van Drew overcame his opponent’s lead in most polls, as well as a considerable fund-raising disadvantage and the familiarity of the Kennedy name. Ms. Kennedy’s husband, Patrick Kennedy, a former congressman from Rhode Island, is a nephew of President John F. Kennedy. Mr. Van Drew was a vocal opponent of Mr. Trump’s impeachment and joined the Republicans in December when it became clear that he could not count on re-election support from Democratic leaders in his South Jersey district, setting up a marquee House race infused with national angst. Mr. Van Drew was able to overcome the stigma of switching parties, buoyed by Mr. Trump’s warm embrace in a district that the president won by about five points in 2016. Comparable results for Mr. Trump in the district this year were not available. Read more
