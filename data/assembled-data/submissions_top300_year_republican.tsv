iqtxd2	republican	Thousands Sign Petition Calling For Nancy Pelosi To Be Prosecuted For ‚ÄòCOVID Violations‚Äô	"Thousands of people have signed a petition calling for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to be prosecuted for ‚ÄúCOVID violations‚Äù after she visited a hair salon ordered closed by the California governor ‚Äî without a mask.

More than 17,000 people have signed the petition, which sets a 25,000-signature goal to urge San Francisco Police Chief William Scott to prosecute the California Democrat.

The petition includes a letter addressed to Scott, which says, ‚ÄúLaws aren‚Äôt just for the ‚Äòlittle people.'‚Äù

‚ÄúNot only did Nancy Pelosi knowingly violate health ordinances, but just destroyed a business because she couldn‚Äôt take a ounce of responsibility. At a very minimum, Nancy Pelosi must be prosecuted by San Francisco for her flaunting of COVID regulations. Now!‚Äù

Pelosi, who has supported full lockdowns over COVID-19 and advocates a national mask policy, was caught last week dropping into the hair salon and walking around without a mask.

In security footage obtained by Fox News, Pelosi can be seen walking through the eSalon in San Francisco without a mask. Ironically, during an appearance on MSNBC that same night, Pelosi blasted President Trump for delivering his Republican National Convention acceptance speech before a live audience on the White House South Lawn, where many people were not wearing masks.

The 81-year-old career politician, who got a wash and a blow out at the salon, took a few days to come up with a defense: It was all a setup.

‚ÄúI take responsibility for trusting the word of the neighborhood salon that I‚Äôve been to over the years many times, and when they said, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre able to accommodate people one person at a time.‚Äô I trusted that,‚Äù the speaker said, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.

‚ÄúSo I take responsibility for falling for a setup. And that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm going to say on that,‚Äù Pelosi said. ‚ÄúI think that this salon owes me an apology, for setting me up.‚Äù

Meanwhile, as the petition notes, ‚Äúthe salon owner gets death threats, while Pelosi has paid ZERO price for her hypocrisy.‚Äù

Salon owner Erica Kious said Wednesday that she is closing her business for good after the controversy.

‚ÄúI am actually done in San Francisco and closing my doors, unfortunately,‚Äù she said on ‚ÄúTucker Carlson Tonight.‚Äù

‚ÄúI started to just get a ton of phone calls, text messages, emails, all my Yelp reviews‚Ä¶ saying that they hope I go under and that I fail,‚Äù Kious said. ‚ÄúSo just a lot of negativity towards my business.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm actually afraid to go back, just because of the messages and emails I‚Äôve been getting,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a little scary and sad. I do have a lot of positive calls and text messages from clients, but other than that, nothing but negativity.‚Äù

Kious has gotten some help from supporters. A GoFundMe page set up in wake of the scandal reached its target of $300,000.

j2opln	republican	BLM supporter who plowed her car into counter-protesters is charged with attempted murder	"Tatiana Turner, 40, of Long Beach was charged with attempted murder Tuesday after she deliberately drove into a crowd of President Donald Trump's supporters

The organizer of a Southern California Black Lives Matter rally was charged with attempted murder Tuesday for driving her car into counter-protesters and running over a woman's head.

Tatiana Turner, 40, of Long Beach deliberately drove into a crowd of President Donald Trump's supporters with the intent to kill the woman and also seriously injured a man who broke his leg, Orange County prosecutors said.

'She positioned her vehicle to be used as a backup weapon and she used that vehicle as a deadly weapon, willing to injure and kill those who stood in her way,' District Attorney Todd Spitzer said in a statement.

But a defense lawyer said Turner tried unsuccessfully to get help from cops Saturday in Yorba Linda after her group was overwhelmed by a hostile crowd.

Turner saw people with guns and feared for her life when she got into her car that was blocked by Trump supporters, attorney Ludlow Creary II said.

According to Newser, Turner called 911 but 'got the runaround'. She then appealed to cops on the ground but was also refused help, they claim.

'Sheriff's deputies on scene didn't do anything,' Creary said.

He said she was trying to get away and didn't intend to hit anyone.

'There were actions that caused her to become fearful for her life and that's when she accelerated,' Creary added.

'She wasn't trying to hit anybody. She wasn't trying to hurt anybody.'

Tatiana Turner, 40, was taken into custody Saturday after witnesses said she drove her car into a crowd of protesters in Yorba Linda, California. She was charged with attempted murder

Black Lives Matter protesters and counter protesters clashed in Yorba Linda, California, on Saturday. Police eventually declared the event an unlawful gathering and cleared the streets

The Orange County Sheriff's Department, however, has claimed Turner was not in any danger when she accelerated.

'It did not appear from the video we've been able to see that there was a direct threat,' spokeswoman Carrie Braun said.

'I wasn't there and wasn't sitting in the vehicle. I don't want to say what she could, would or should have done. Clearly any time an incident like this occurs it's tragic for everybody involved.'

Turner made her first appearance in court remotely from the jail and was ordered held on $1 million bail. A not guilty plea was entered on her behalf by her lawyer.

According to NBC Los Angeles, the charges hold a potential life sentence.

The incident is one of more than 100 where motorists have plowed into demonstrations since late May, following protests against police brutality that grew nationwide over the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis officer, according to Ari Weil, deputy director on the Chicago Project on Security and Threats at the University of Chicago.

The vast majority of those cases tallied by Weil involved motorists who ran into those demonstrating for causes aligned with the Black Lives Matter movement, Weil said.

He knows of only one other instance where that wasn't the case when a man drove into a people rallying in support of police officers in Eaton, Colorado, in July.

'It's a man bites dog case when compared to the usual pattern,' said Jody Armour, a law professor at the University of Southern California.

Armour said it may be difficult for prosecutors to prove Turner tried to kill someone because it requires showing she was more than just reckless or negligent.

'When you're talking about attempted murder, you're talking a requirement that the state prove that ... she drove into the crowd with the true purpose to cause someone's death,' Armour said.

'That says something about their motivations, their character, their state of mind. It's a value judgment. It's a moral judgment.'

Tatiana Turner was arrested after video, pictured, showed her driving a car into a crowd of Trump supporters in southern California on Saturday afternoon, injuring two

'Oh my God!' a woman is heard screaming on video as the white Nissan Versa accelerates into the crowd, knocking the demonstrators to the pavement on Saturday

Furious crowd members chased the car, hitting it with flag poles, but within seconds police intervened, taking Turner into custody. She was charged with attempted murder Tuesday

Prosecutors are alleging just that. The felony complaint said Turner had the 'specific intent to kill' the woman who was run over.

The victim has not been named. Authorities said she was hospitalized with major injuries.

Turner, who has a felony record for drug sales and domestic violence, is also charged with six counts of assault with a deadly weapon, including one count for causing great bodily injury, mayhem, and two counts of the use of pepper spray by a felon.

Turner's group, Urban Organizers Coalition, had planned a peaceful march Saturday at the Yorba Linda Library, about 30 miles southeast of Los Angeles.

But they were quickly outnumbered and threatened by the other group, Creary said.

The DA, however, referred to Turner's group as 'professional militant organizers'.

Turner was seen in videos waving a baton and spraying what appeared to be pepper spray earlier in the protest. Some members of her group had helmets and riot shields.

Creary said the charges were excessive.

'In my opinion, it's a message to activists that go to OC,' Creary said.

'They want to let them know that they're going to push to the full extent of the law against activists. Again, it's part of the hostile environment.'

Deputies were on the scene to maintain peace and quickly arrested the driver

Members of Caravan4Justice are seen at a rally in June. Turner is the founder of the group, according to trademark filings and a GoFundMe campaign

Orange County Sheriff deputies line up as Black Lives Matter protesters and counter protesters clash in Yorba Linda. People were struck by a car and injured during the events

The chaos unfolded as about 250 people gathered, some with a group called Caravan4Justice supporting Black Lives Matter, and others to stage a nearby counter-protest supporting Trump.

Federal records show that Turner filed a trademark application for Caravan4Justice in July, and a GoFundMe campaign names her as the group's 'founder'.

Police confirmed that Turner is believed to be a member of the Caravan4Justice.

It was around 3pm, police say, when a car in the parking lot of the of the Yorba Linda Public Library at 18181 Imperial Highway accelerated into the road and struck at least two individuals.

'Oh my God!' a woman is heard screaming on video as the white Nissan Versa accelerates into the crowd, knocking the demonstrators to the pavement and speeding away.

Furious crowd members chased the car, hitting it with flag poles, but within seconds police intervened, taking the female driver into custody.

The two injured people, a man and a woman, were taken to a hospital, said Braun.

The man suffered two broken legs and the woman had major injuries. They are both expected to survive.

Counter-protesters had surrounded Turner's car as she tried to leave

Turner could be seen behind the steering wheel before she accelerated

The incident occurred as members of Black Lives Matter demonstrated against police brutality and systemic racism.

Counter-protesters crossed six-lane Imperial Highway and confronted the BLM protesters, authorities said. The protesters also confronted each other in the parking lot of the Yorba Linda public library, Braun said.

A white sedan came went through the crowd in the parking lot or the exit of the parking lot at the public library, injuring two people, Braun added.

People chased the car as it tried to drive away, and it was eventually stopped and was surrounded by police, she said.

The Register reported it was not known how fast the car was going. The back windshield had been broken out, and it had a flagpole sticking out of it. The front windshield was smashed, the Register reported.

Braun said there were 300 people total and at some point it was declared an unlawful assembly and dispersal orders were given.

She added that the department were investigating claims from Turner's lawyers that officers had not helped her despite her requests.

A protester named only as Mike as he feared harassment from left-wing groups told NBC that he saw the protesters being injured after they had hemmed in the car.

He said the protesters were harassing Turner causing a panicked look on her face.

'They started to pound on her car,'' he said. 'It took damage.'

On Thursday night, a BLM protester was struck by a pickup truck during a march in Hollywood and suffered non-life-threatening injuries.

Los Angeles police said Friday the preliminary investigation found that the driver was attempting to maneuver through the crowd when protesters began beating the vehicle with sticks and attempted to open the door.

The driver was attempting to drive away from the situation when he struck the protester. The driver stopped several blocks away and cooperated with officers. He was released pending the outcome of the investigation."	right

Trump, speaking in a video he tweeted out Tuesday evening, claimed that stimulus, passed by Congress Monday night, contains a number of ‚Äúwasteful items‚Äù that he demanded be eliminated, including millions in foreign aid and funding for environmental projects. He also pressured Congressional lawmakers to raise the direct stimulus payments from $600 for individuals to $2,000 and provide increased aid for small businesses, ‚Äúin particular restaurants.‚Äù (RELATED: Biden Vows To Give Congress His Plan For ‚ÄòWhat Comes Next‚Äô On Coronavirus ‚ÄòEarly Next Year‚Äô)

‚ÄúCongress found plenty of money for foreign countries, lobbyists and special interests while sending the bare minimum to the American people who need it. It was not their fault,‚Äù Trump stated. ‚ÄúIt was China‚Äôs fault, not their fault.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm asking Congress to amend this bill,‚Äù he continued, ‚Äúand to send me a suitable bill, or that next administration will have to deliver a covid relief package and maybe that administration will be me.‚Äù

White House officials had previously told the Daily Caller in private and stated publicly that the president would sign any coronavirus stimulus into law that crossed his desk.

President-elect Joe Biden, speaking to reporters in Wilmington, Delaware in Tuesday afternoon, vowed to deliver his own stimulus proposal to Congress ‚Äúearly next year.‚Äù

WATCH:

‚ÄúThere will be no time to waste in taking the steps we need to turn this crisis around. My administration will start to do this, its part, on our first day in office with masking requirements, a new strategy for testing, accelerated protection, protective gear,‚Äù he stated. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to challenge Congress and the American people to step up immediately as well to do their part.‚Äù (RELATED: Biden Takes Coronavirus Vaccine On Camera ‚Äî ‚ÄòThis Is Just The Beginning‚Äô)

hvql87	republican	Red bull just fired it's two top executives for pushing SJW politics into the company.	"Experience Revolver without ads Hide ads now

Red Bull just reminded their ‚Äòwokest‚Äô employees who calls the shots in a total massacre of ‚Äúsocial justice warrior‚Äù employees.

Not only were the top two North American executives fired, but so were entire marketing teams and ‚Äúculture‚Äù teams that were dedicated to pushing the lie of systemic racism.

Red Bull has just shown the way forward for all who want to prevent a total Marxist-style takeover of business and government in America. There is no appeasing these people, the only way forward is to fire them as quickly as possible, and with no mercy. Err on the side of firing everyone, if need be.

What this country needs, at every level of society, academia, and government, is a total and complete purge of ‚Äòwoke‚Äô revolutionaries, before the blood starts running in the streets.

The Wall Street Journal has more:

The maker of Red Bull energy drinks has replaced its top U.S. executives amid internal tensions over the closely held company‚Äôs response to the Black Lives Matter movement. Red Bull GmbH, the Austrian company that makes the drink, said Stefan Kozak, its North America chief executive, and Amy Taylor, its North America president and chief marketing officer, have left the company. It named other executives to temporarily fill the roles. Red Bull didn‚Äôt give a reason for the changes, which were announced in an internal memo Monday. Ms. Taylor had been working on diversity and inclusion efforts within the company with Mr. Kozak‚Äôs support for several years but was met with opposition when she began advocating for Red Bull to be more overt in its support of racial justice in the last month, according to people familiar with the matter. Some U.S. employees had recently raised concerns about what they considered the company‚Äôs inaction on the Black Lives Matter movement. [Wall Street Journal]

According to Business Insider, these were ‚Äúacts of retaliation.‚Äù And rightly so. If you find yourself in this position, get an army of lawyers and find out the quickest legal route to excising the cancer of ‚Äúsocial justice warriors‚Äù in your company.

Several insiders close to the situation said it was widely believed that Kozak and Taylor were fired by Austrian leadership over the leak and internal tension over diversity issues. Two employees said Taylor had been working on a project to increase Black representation at Red Bull but that the leadership wasn‚Äôt interested. [Business Insider]

WATCH: Check out Darren Beattie's latest interviews

Have you ever heard of the phrase, ‚Äúget woke, go broke?‚Äù It turns out there is a simple way to prevent this, and it involves firing people indiscriminately, until the rest of the employees realize that the only way they are going to be able to keep their jobs is by being professional, and keeping their kook politics out of the workplace. Pour encourager les autres.

Along with firing the executives, Red Bull cut or dissolved entertainment and culture teams in Canada, the UK, and Austria and canceled most of its major cultural events, including its annual Red Bull Music Festival and Red Bull Presents. ‚Ä¶ Two employees said global CEO Dietrich Mateschitz told staff earlier this year that there wouldn‚Äôt be any layoffs in 2020.

Two others who work in marketing, however, said management told them that between 20 and 50 people were laid off or told that they would have to choose between new jobs and exit packages. Another employee said the culture teams were seen as the most vocal about racial justice matters and that US staffers saw the restructuring as a form of punishment. [Business Insider]

You absolutely love to see it.

It turns out that the CEO of Red Bull is a pretty cool guy. From Daily Mail:

Red Bull‚Äôs billionaire CEO Dietrich Mateschitz is a Donald Trump admirer who has spoken out against ‚Äòpolitical correctness‚Äô. The 76-year-old tycoon also owns a media firm which has been criticized for giving a platform to far-right activists in his native Austria. ‚Ä¶ The company‚Äôs global CEO is Austrian billionaire Dietrich Mateschitz, who has an estimated fortune of $26billion and owns a private island in Fiji. In a 2017 interview, Mateschitz expressed sympathy with Donald Trump and said the new president ‚Äòsimply needs time‚Äô. ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs as much of an idiot as he‚Äôs made out to be,‚Äô he told the newspaper Kleine Zeitung at the time. ‚ÄòWhen you speak to Americans you often hear that they‚Äôre essentially happy to have a new administration. There was plenty to question about the previous one,‚Äô he said, referring to the Obama administration. Raging at ‚Äòpolitical correctness‚Äô and the ‚Äòintellectual elite‚Äô, Mateschitz was also highly critical of Germany and Austria for opening their doors at the height of the 2015 refugee crisis. Taking aim at those who encouraged refugees or used Angela Merkel‚Äôs slogan of ‚Äòwe‚Äôll manage it‚Äô, he said that none of those people ‚Äòmade their guest rooms available for five migrants to live in‚Äô. [Daily Mail]

Long Live Dietrich Mateschitz.

A new CATO Institute/YouGov national survey found 62% of Americans say the political climate today prevents them from saying what they believe. This is up several points from 2017 when 58% of Americans said they were afraid to share their political beliefs.

‚Äú31% of liberals, 30% of moderates and 34% of conservatives are worried their political views could get them fired or harm their career trajectory,‚Äù the CATO survey stated.

A recent poll conducted by Politico found that a plurality of Americans believe cancel culture has gone too far. (RELATED: Poll: Large Plurality of Americans Say Cancel Culture Has Gone Too Far)

‚ÄúThere have been shifts across the board, where more people among all political groups feel they are walking on eggshells,‚Äù the CATO survey found, adding, ‚Äúmajorities of Democrats (52%), independents (59%) and Republicans (77%) who all agree they have political opinions they are afraid to share.¬≠¬≠‚Äù

‚ÄúStrong liberals stand out, however, as the only political group who feel they can express themselves. Nearly 6 in 10 (58%) of staunch liberals feel they can say what they believe,‚Äù the CATO survey found.

A majority of centrist liberals, who in 2017 said they could express their views freely, now say they have to self-censor.

According to the CATO survey, self-censorship spans all ethnicities, with 65% of Latino Americans, 64% of white Americans, and 49% of African Americans saying they have political views they are afraid to share.

‚ÄúThis large number from across demographic groups suggests withheld opinions may not simply be radical or fringe perspectives in the process of being socially marginalized. Instead many of these opinions may be shared by a large number of people,‚Äù the CATO study concluded.

Both surveys, CATO and Politico, suggest that those who engage and support cancel culture are a vocal minority of Americans, not the majority. (RELATED: ‚ÄòCancel Culture Is A Cancer‚Äô: Dean Cain Says The Twitter Mob Will Attack For Literally Anything‚Äô)

‚ÄúWhile online shaming may seem like a major preoccupation for the public if you spend a lot of time on Twitter, only 40% of voters say they have participated in cancel culture and only one in 10 say they participate ‚Äòoften,'‚Äù the Politico poll found.

Gabriel Johnson, who says he's an eight-year veteran of the Marines, sought to decorate a barrier surrounding the Mark O. Hatfield Courthouse with the American flag because he‚Äôs tired of the violent protests in the city, according to local media outlets.

‚ÄúI felt compelled to show my patriotism and to try to bring a different message to the courthouse,‚Äù Johnson said, according to FOX 12.

You might recognize Gabriel from last night. He was at the courthouse with an American flag.

‚ÄúMy narrative is simply we all need to come together. Man, that‚Äôs it. You‚Äôre mad at me because I got a flag?‚Äù he told a protester.

‚ÄúIf you stand for justice, come here and stand with me,‚Äù Johnson yelled at protesters Saturday night in a video posted to social media. ‚ÄúStand with me because I‚Äôm here for justice. I‚Äôm not here to tear down this f---ing fence; I‚Äôm not here to spray paint. It‚Äôs going on every day. If you don‚Äôt want to get gassed, stop! If you don‚Äôt want to get gassed, stop!

Johnson lives close to the courthouse, which has seen repeated nights of violent protests, and said the explosions he‚Äôs heard reminded him of Iraq.

‚ÄúOn Friday night, I counted 82 explosions, house full of gas. I‚Äôm on the 12th floor here. It reminded me of being in Iraq and my experience of being in Iraq, not here in Portland, not where it‚Äôs supposed to be safe, not where it‚Äôs supposed to be peaceful,‚Äù he said.

The death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on Memorial Day set off a wave of protests against police brutality and racial inequality in cities across the country, including Portland.

‚ÄúI support the city; I support the police; I support us coming together because it‚Äôs about time,‚Äù Johnson told local outlet KOIN. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been 60-plus days of us being out in the street and like, what‚Äôs been accomplished?‚Äù

President Trump tweeted on Sunday night, ‚ÄúWe are trying to help Portland, not hurt it. Their leadership has, for months, lost control of the anarchists and agitators. They are missing in action. We must protect Federal property, AND OUR PEOPLE. These were not merely protesters, these are the real deal!‚Äù

The mayor of Portland, Ted Wheeler, has repeatedly said that federal law enforcement officials in the city are not welcome. The Democrat said on Sunday that the federal officers in the city have made the riots worse by arresting and pulling protesters into unmarked vans .

‚ÄúWell, the president has a complete misunderstanding of cause and effect. What‚Äôs happening here is, we have dozens, if not hundreds, of federal troops descending upon our city,‚Äù said Wheeler on CNN. ‚ÄúAnd what they‚Äôre doing is, they are sharply escalating the situation. Their presence here is actually leading to more violence and more vandalism. And it‚Äôs not helping the situation at all. They‚Äôre not wanted here. We haven‚Äôt asked them here. In fact, we want them to leave. What we‚Äôre seeing is a blatant abuse of police tactics by the federal government, by a Trump administration that‚Äôs falling in the polls. And this is a direct threat to our democracy."""	right

ipsofm	republican	Joe Biden Claims 6,000 Military Members Dead From COVID. The Real Number Is 7	"Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden said Wednesday that more than 6,000 military members have died from coronavirus, Department of Defense (DOD) statistics show the real number is just seven deaths.

While speaking in Michigan on Wednesday, Biden significantly overstated both the number of COVID infections in the military, as well as the number of COVID deaths.

‚ÄúMilitary COVID infected: 118,984,‚Äù Biden said while reading out a list of statistics. ‚ÄúMilitary COVID deaths: 6,114.‚Äù

Former Vice President Biden said today that more than 6,000 members of the US military have died due to the coronavirus. The actual number is seven according to the @DeptofDefense https://t.co/AJmCelSpOD ‚Äî Ryan Browne (@rabrowne75) September 9, 2020

Both of those numbers are wrong. (RELATED: Joe Biden Keeps Pushing Misinformation About Coronavirus. Here Are 5 Examples)

DOD statistics show that the number of recorded coronavirus infections in the military is just over 40,000, with just seven deaths.

It‚Äôs not clear where Biden got the erroneous numbers. His campaign didn‚Äôt immediately return the Daily Caller News Foundation‚Äôs request for comment on the errors.

jnyh22	republican	Dan Crenshaw, Star Republican Freshman, Holds On to Texas House Seat	"Representative Dan Crenshaw, Republican of Texas, won a second term in Congress on Tuesday, fending off a Democratic challenge in his Houston area from Sima Ladjevardian, an Iranian-born immigrant who had been an adviser to former Representative Beto O‚ÄôRourke.

Mr. Crenshaw, whose victory was called by The Associated Press, had been a favorite to retain his seat, despite Democrats‚Äô high hopes for Texas and efforts to expand their reach into the suburbs. A former member of the Navy SEALs, he has been one of the best-known freshmen in Congress since 2018, when the ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live‚Äù comedian Pete Davidson joked disastrously about his eye patch.

The National Republican Congressional Committee and other political organizations demanded that Mr. Davidson apologize to Mr. Crenshaw, who lost an eye in combat. His graceful acceptance on the air the next week (‚ÄúThanks for making a Republican look good,‚Äù he joked to Mr. Davidson) helped make him a political celebrity, a draw for Republican donors and a regular on political talk shows.

He has been a stalwart supporter of President Trump on issues ranging from the border wall to athletes kneeling for the national anthem, and has energetically defended the president‚Äôs pandemic response."	right
